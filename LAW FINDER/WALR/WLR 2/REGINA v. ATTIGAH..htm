												The appellant, a police 
												inspector, was convicted of 
												extortion by a judge sitting 
												with three assessors. The main 
												evidence against him came from 
												two men, one of whom was the 
												victim of the alleged extortion. 
												They asserted that an accomplice 
												of the appellant, who was not 
												present at the trial, had 
												approached the victim with a 
												story that they, the accomplice 
												and the victim, would be 
												prosecuted for an offence unless 
												they provided the appellant with 
												a certain sum of money. The 
												assertions were supported by a 
												receipt and a promissory note 
												signed by the accomplice (but to 
												neither of which the appellant 
												was a party) and by the fact 
												that the victim had, at one 
												stage, been arrested. The 
												appellant, in his defence, 
												alleged a conspiracy against him 
												by the two witnesses and led 
												evidence as to his own good 
												character. The judge held that 
												evidence as to good character 
												was immaterial before verdict. 
												Of the three assessors, two were 
												of the opinion that the 
												appellant was guilty while the 
												third was in doubt .&#8226; </span>

												good character is a material 
												matter for consideration where 
												the evidence as to the 
												commission of an offence leaves 
												doubt: where there is no doubt 
												as to guilt, good character 
												provides no answer. Evidence as 
												to good character is thus always 
												properly admissible before 
												verdict. In this case on the 
												facts the learned judge should 
												have directed himself on the 
												possibility of conspiracy: had 
												he done so doubts might have 
												been introduced so as to make 
												the evidence of good character 
												material. As the rejection of 
												this evidence deprived the 
												appellant of a reasonable chance 
												of acquittal he was entitled to 
												have the verdict set aside.

												The following judgment of the 
												court was given by COUSSEY P. 
												Emmanuel Yaw Attigah was 
												convicted at the Cape Coast 
												Assizes on November 14, 1956, by 
												a judge sitting with three 
												assessors for that, on December 
												15, 1954, at Agona Swedru he did 
												for the purpose of extorting the 
												sum of £100 from Daniel Kwesi 
												Obimpe, threaten to accuse the 
												said Daniel K wesi Obimpe of an 
												infamous offence namely, of 
												intentionally and unlawfully 
												setting fire to lorry No. W.P. 
												6786. He appealed to this court 
												against his conviction. </span>
												</p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.6pt; margin-left: .7pt; margin-right: .45pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The case for the prosecution 
												depended mainly on the evidence 
												of Obimpe and Robert B. Otoo, 
												the second and third witnesses 
												for the prosecution. The 
												appellant claims that at the 
												relevant time he was 
												investigating a report 
												concerning Obimpe made to him by 
												one Esson, a convict on licence 
												who had disappeared before the 
												trial. Otoo, the appellant says, 
												was not on speaking terms with 
												him because the appellant, when 
												a police sergeant at Elmina, had 
												refused to permit Otoo to be a 
												professional bailer of persons 
												charged with offences. These men 
												supported their story against 
												the appellant with a promissory 
												note, and a temporary receipt, 
												to neither of which the 
												appellant was a party but which, 
												it is alleged, Esson took as the 
												appellant's accomplice or agent.
												</span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.6pt; margin-left: .7pt; margin-right: .45pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Two of the assessors were of 
												opinion that the appellant was 
												guilty, one had a doubt and gave 
												the appellant the benefit of 
												that doubt. The learned trial 
												judge in convicting the 
												appellant as charged found as 
												follows: </span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 15.1pt; margin-left: 20.4pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; I agree with the majority 
												opinion of the assessors. I have 
												no doubt at all in my mind that 
												the defendant, acting in concert 
												with one Esson, plotted to 
												extract money from Obimpe; that 
												in pursuance of that plan the 
												defendant had Obimpe arrested at 
												Takoradi under the pretence that 
												an insurance company had 
												directed that he and the said 
												Esson should be prosecuted; that 
												when Obimpe came to Swedru on 
												December 13, 1954, the defen· 
												dant had bail granted t{) him to 
												report at Swedru Police Station 
												at 2 p.m. on December 14, 1954; 
												that on December 13, 1954, after 
												Obimpe had been granted bail, 
												Esson, pretending to Obimpe and 
												Otoo that he, Esson, did not 
												want to go to prison, left 
												Obimpe and Otoo and went back 
												alone to see the defendant and 
												then returned to Obimpe and Otoo 
												with a story whereby he induced 
												Otoo and eventually Obimpe to go 
												with him to the defendant;
												<font color="#FF0000">pg 212</font> 
												that at that interview the 
												defendant demanded the sum of 
												£400 from Obimpe, as alleged by 
												Obimpe and Otoo; that Obimpe 
												agreed to pay, Esson having 
												alleged he would be responsible 
												for £200 of it; and that on 
												December 15, 1954, Obimpe paid 
												£100 to the defendant in part 
												payment of the £400 demanded by 
												the defendant and thereupon 
												Obimpe was relieved from his 
												obligation to report under the 
												bail bond. ,. </span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.85pt; margin-left: .45pt; margin-right: .7pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellant was defended by 
												counsel. Besides denying on oath 
												the facts against him and 
												accusing the principal witness 
												of a con­spiracy to injure him 
												by perjured evidence, the 
												appellant put his good character 
												in issue. He was an inspector of 
												police who had been in the force 
												for twenty-four years. He held 
												the meritorious medal for long 
												service; he had been awarded the 
												Police medal for exceptional 
												gallantry when on duty and he 
												was the recipient of a letter of 
												commendation from His Majesty's 
												Secretary of State for the 
												Colonies. He produced papers 
												testifying to his general good 
												reputation. In the following 
												passage of his judgment the 
												learned judge categorically held 
												that the appellant's good 
												character was a consideration 
												immaterial before verdict. He 
												said: </span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.85pt; margin-left: 20.4pt; margin-right: .95pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; Counsel for the defendant has 
												urged with great labour that the 
												defendant is not the type of 
												person to commit such a crime in 
												view of his good character and 
												the very high commendations he 
												has had in the police force. 
												Those submissions are matters of 
												sentiment which cannot be 
												considered at this stage.&quot;
												</span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.85pt; margin-left: .45pt; margin-right: .7pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The principal ground of appeal, 
												and upon which a strong 
												submis­sion has been made, is 
												that the learned judge erred in 
												not directing the court and 
												assessors to have regard to the 
												appellant's proved character for 
												rectitude and integrity as 
												affecting the credibility of his 
												evidence and. also not directing 
												himself, when considering the 
												pro­babilities of the case, to

												., It has been usual to treat 
												the good character of the party 
												accused as evidence to be taken 
												into consideration only in 
												doubtful cases. Juries have 
												generally been told that where 
												the facts proved are such as to 
												satisfy their minds of the guilt 
												of the party, character, however 
												excellent, is no subject for 
												their consideration; but that 
												when they entertain any doubt of 
												the guilt of the party, they may 
												properly turn their attention to 
												the good character which he has 
												received. It is, however, 
												submitted with deference that 
												the good character of the party 
												accused, satisfactorily 
												established by competent 
												witnesses, is an ingredient 
												which ought always to be 
												submitted to the consideration 
												of the jury, together with the 
												other facts and circumstances of 
												the case. The nature of the 
												charge, and the evidence by 
												which it is supported, will 
												often render such ingredient of 
												little or no avail; but the more 
												correct course seems to be, not, 
												in any case to withdraw it from 
												considera­tion, but to leave the 
												jury to form their conclusion 
												upon the whole of the evidence, 
												whether an individual, whose

												unblemished, has or has not 
												committed the particular crime
