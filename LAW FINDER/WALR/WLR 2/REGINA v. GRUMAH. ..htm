												an insane delusion, for the

												there had been a sufficient 
												direction, then, on the facts, 
												the jury might probably have

												[EDITORIAL NOTE. The Criminal 
												Procedure Code, c. 10 of 1951, 
												s. 137, which is linked with the 
												Criminal Code, s. 52 (2), is 
												concerned with a person, who is 
												&quot;insane so as not to be 
												responsible ... for his 
												actions.&quot; The latter section 
												applies the procedure of the 
												former section in cases where an 
												accused is &quot;under the influence 
												of an insane delusion of such a 
												nature as to render him ... an 
												unfit subject for punishment 
												.... &quot; It would thus appear that 
												the Ordinance is concerned 
												principally with whether or not 
												the insanity is of such a nature 
												as to make punishment pointless: 
												it is not concerned with the 
												form the delusion takes. Thus, A 
												kills B while under the insane 
												delusion that B would otherwise 
												kill him, and A kills B while 
												under the insane delusion that B 
												is his brother: the section is 
												equally applicable in each

												The following judgment of the 
												court was given by COUSSEY P.
												</span></p>
												<p class="Style">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												The appellant was charged with 
												the murder of a youth, Kwame 
												Boadu alias Kwami Dappo, at 
												Nkrondua village in the Western 
												Judicial <font color="#FF0000">
												pg 256 </font>Division on 
												February 23, 1956. When he was 
												arraigned on June 6, 1956, the 
												trial was adjourned by the court 
												for a medical statement as to 
												his state of mind. On June 29, 
												1956, the psychiatric specialist 
												reported that in his opinion the 
												appellant was unfit to plead. On 
												September 12, 1956, the court 
												was of opinion that the 
												appellant was still incapable of 
												making his defence, owing to his 
												state of mind, and thereupon 
												postponed the proceedings for 
												further medical observation of 
												the appellant. On January 2, 
												1957, the appellant was again 
												arraigned before the same judge 
												at the Sekondi Assizes. There is 
												no record of any further enquiry 
												regarding the state of the 
												appellant's mind nor of a 
												certificate as to his fitness to 
												plead, but on that day the 
												appellant apparently pleaded&quot; 
												not guilty&quot; to the charge and 
												the trial proceeded. </span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.85pt; margin-right: .45pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The case for the prosecution was 
												that while the appellant, a farm 
												labourer, was working with the 
												deceased and another farm 
												labourer, the second witness for 
												the prosecution, on their 
												employer's farm, the appellant 
												suddenly attacked the deceased 
												with the cutlass he was holding 
												and inflicted the wounds to the 
												head and back of the neck of the 
												deceased from which he died. 
												There was no apparent motive for 
												this sudden attack. </span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-indent: .2in; margin-left: .45pt; margin-right: .7pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												When charged with the crime the 
												appellant made a voluntary 
												state­ment and he also gave 
												evidence on oath at the trial.
												</span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.85pt; margin-right: .45pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The defence, according to the 
												statement of the appellant made 
												to the police, was that at the 
												farm the deceased suddenly told 
												him that before sunset one of 
												them would either live or die, 
												that the appellant became afraid 
												and believed there was a plot to 
												kill him and, being afraid, he 
												killed the deceased, before his 
												turn came, with the cutlass he 
												was then holding. Giving 
												evidence on oath the appellant 
												said he had been told by the 
												deceased that he would be killed 
												before going to the farm and he 
												was afraid to accompany the 
												deceased to cut plantains 
												because he had a thorn in his 
												foot and also because he was 
												afraid the deceased would kill 
												him if he went with him. He also 
												said the deceased raised a 
												cutlass before the appellant cut 
												him with his cutlass. </span>
												</p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.85pt; margin-right: .45pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The defence called as a witness 
												the psychiatric specialist 
												attached to the Mental Hospital 
												at Accra who was of opinion that 
												the appellant was fit to plead, 
												but who could not speak as to 
												the appellant's state of mind at 
												the time of the act charged. He 
												testified that a delusion is a 
												symptom of mental disturbance 
												and is a false belief which is 
												unshakable by facts. &quot;It would 
												be a delusion,&quot; he said, &quot; if a 
												person believes he is going to 
												be killed if in fact he was not 
												going to be killed ... a 
												delusion is a disease of the 
												mind. &quot; </span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.85pt; margin-right: .45pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is not clear from the summary 
												before us of the learned judge's 
												summing-up to the jury, that he 
												sufficiently distinguished the 
												defence of self-defence, when 
												the deceased allegedly attacked 
												the appellant, from the defence 
												of insane delusion, namely, that 
												he believed he was
												<font color="#FF0000">pg 257
												</font>about to meet his death 
												at the handsof the deceased 
												whereupon he struck the deceased 
												whilst that delusion was 
												operating on his mind. </span>
												</p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.85pt; margin-right: .45pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												We think that if there had been 
												a correct and adequate direction 
												the jury might probably, on the 
												evidence, have found that the 
												offence was committed by the 
												appellant under the influence of 
												an insane delusion and have 
												returned a verdict of guilty but 
												insane-see the Criminal Code, c. 
												9 of 1951, s. 52 (2) and the 
												Criminal Procedure Code, c. 10 
												of 1951, s. 13'7. Upon the whole 
												case we think it would not be 
												right to allow the verdict to 
												stand. We accordingly set aside 
												the verdict and sentence of 
												death and substitute the special 
												verdict that the appellant was 
												guilty of the act charged but 
												was insane at the time he did 
												the act. It is ordered that the 
												appellant be detained in custody 
												at the Mental Hospital at Accra 
												during Her Majesty's pleasure.
