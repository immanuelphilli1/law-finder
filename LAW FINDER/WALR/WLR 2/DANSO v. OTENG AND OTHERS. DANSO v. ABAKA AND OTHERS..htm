												The plaintiff was a traditional 
												member, appointed by a State 
												Council, of a local authority, 
												and in addition was a cocoa 
												buyer. The defendants in the 
												first suit were the chairman of 
												the local authority, the 
												chairman of its finance 
												committee and two local 
												authority police officers. The 
												defendants in the second suit 
												were local authority police 
												officers. After the introduction 
												of the Local Government 
												Ordinance, c. 64 of 1951, some 
												difficulties were experienced in 
												the interpretation of section 74 
												of the Ordinance, which requires 
												that the revenues of stool lands 
												should be paid to the local 
												authority within whose area the 
												land lay, and guidance was given 
												by a circular from the Ministry 
												of Local Government declaring 
												that revenue from stool lands, 
												within the meaning of the 
												section, meant any consideration 
												received from transactions in 
												stool land, not revenue which 
												was merely the proceeds of sale 
												of the produce of such land. The 
												local authority concerned, or at 
												least the two defendant members 
												of it, disagreed (or appeared to 
												disagree) with this ruling by 
												the Ministry and demanded that 
												the plaintiff should account to 
												the local authority for the 
												purchase price of cocoa he had 
												purchased from stool land. The 
												plaintiff replied that he had 
												paid this money to the treasury 
												of the appropriate State Council 
												and he produced a receipt to 
												this effect .. Subsequently the 
												first defendant in the first 
												suit laid a complaint with the 
												local authority police to the 
												effect that the plaintiff was 
												suspected of misappropriating 
												the proceeds from stool cocoa 
												farms. As a result of this 
												complaint the plaintiff was 
												arrested, without warrant, by 
												one of the defendant police 
												officers and on each of two 
												successive days was detained for 
												some hours at the local 
												authority police station. He was 
												released on the second day only 
												after paying over the money that 
												had been claimed from him.
												</span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -5.8pt; margin-left: .25in">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												The reaction of the plaintiff to 
												this treatment was to commence 
												an action (the first of the two 
												consolidated suits) for false 
												imprisonment. On the day on 
												which the writ of summons was 
												served on the defendant the 
												plaintiff was again arrested 
												without warrant. He was charged 
												with attempted theft of the 
												money he had, under pressure, 
												eventually paid to the local 
												authority, and was convicted 
												before a Native Court. On appeal 
												to a magistrate's court this 
												conviction was quashed. The 
												second arrest and the subsequent 
												prosecution formed the basis of 
												the second action, which was for 
												false imprisonment and malicious 
												prosecution. In the first action 
												the first two defendants 
												pleaded, inter alia, that they 
												acted bona fide for the purposes 
												of the Local Government 
												Ordinance, c. 64 of 1951, and 
												that they were entitled to the 
												protection afforded by section 
												136 of that Ordinance. At the 
												trial of the two suits judgment 
												was given for the defendants in 
												both cases. In the second suit 
												this was partly on the grounds 
												that the plaintiff had been 
												convicted initially of the 
												offence with which he stood 
												charged and therefore an action 
												for malicious prosecution could 
												not lie. </span></p>

												</span><i>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Held, </span></i>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(i) in the first suit, on the 
												facts the first two defendants 
												had merely placed a matter 
												before the police for 
												investigation so that, in the 
												absence of evidence to show that 
												they had influenced the police 
												in the latter's course of 
												action, and regardless of the 
												protection, if any, afforded by 
												the Local Government Ordinance, 
												c. 64 of 1951, s. 136, the first 
												two defendants could not be 
												regarded as party to the false 
												imprisonment. </span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -5.8pt; margin-left: .25in">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(ii) As to the remaining 
												defendants in the first suit, 
												they had followed an unlawful 
												course of action in arresting 
												and detaining the plaintiff 
												without a warrant. On the facts 
												these acts were not done in good 
												faith in pursuance of their 
												duty, but were done with the 
												object of obtaining money for 
												the first two defendants. The 
												claim against these defendants 
												was therefore sufficiently 
												established. </span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -5.8pt; margin-left: .25in">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(iii) In a charge of malicious 
												prosecution, the essential 
												ingredients of which are malice 
												and the absence of reasonable 
												and probable cause, the effect 
												of a conviction which is quashed 
												on appeal is not to defeat the 
												cause of action but to place a 
												heavier onus on the plaintiff in 
												establishing malice and the 
												absence of reasonable and 
												probable cause. On the facts in 
												the second suit the defendants 
												had acted with malice and 
												without reasonable and probable 
												cause. </span></p>

													The dispute as to revenue of

													and second defendants, Oteng 
													and Duro, were perfectly 
													aware, with the knowledge 
													they must have had of the 
													Minister's interpretation of 
													the meaning of &quot;revenue.&quot; It 
													was an interpretation which, 
													perhaps, they did not

													plaintiff was entitled to 
													act upon in the face of a

													aware, on July 31, that the 
													plaintiff had paid the 
													proceeds in question to the 
													State Council. There was no 
													reasonable ground to suspect 
													that the plaintiff had 
													dishonestly appropriated the 
													money or had attempted to do 
													so. Their proper course was 
													to apply to the State 
													Council's Treasury for the 
													money, if they claimed it. 
													That would, no doubt, have 
													resulted in controversy and 
													probably litigation between 
													Local Council and State 
													Council. The easier course, 
													these defendants considered,

													The first and second 
													defendants are entitled to 
													say, as they do say, that 
													they only placed the matter 
													before the police for 
													investigation. They shield 
													themselves behind the 
													police. There is no 
													conclusive evidence to show 
													that they so influenced the 
													third defendant, Inspector 
													Abaka, that he acted under 
													their direction or 
													authorization and there­fore 
													the first and second 
													defendants cannot be held 
													responsible for the arrest 
													and detention on August 25 
													and 26. It follows that the 
													appeal so far as affects 
													them must be dismissed. The 
													case against the third and 
													fourth defendants does not 
													admit of any doubt. This was 
													an unlawful arrest. The 
													third defendant seeks to 
													justify it by saying, not 
													that he was unaware of the 
													claim of the State Council 
													but that he did not believe 
													the receipt produced by the 
													plaintiff to be genuine; it 
													was not the form of receipt 
													he expected from the State 
													Council, he says and, 
													further, he believed the 
													receipt was issued by 
													arrangement. But he had only 
													to telephone the State 
													Council Treasury at Kibi as 
													a first step in his 
													enquiries to find out if the 
													money had been paid and the 
													receipt genuine. He did not 
													do so. 1£ he had honestly 
													investigated the matter even 
													cursorily he would have 
													concluded that no criminal 
													offence had been committed. 
													The third defendant did not 
													act in good faith. He did 
													not reasonably believe that 
													the plaintiff had attempted 
													to commit a felony. He 
													caused the plaintiff's 
													arrest to obtain the money 
													for the first and second 
													defendants. Statutory 
													protection does not cover 
													his act nor that of the 
													fourth defendant, who acted 
													under his orders and made 
													the initial arrest without 
													warrant. As to the third and 
													fourth defendants the appeal 
													is allowed, the judgment of 
													the court below is set aside 
													and judgment is entered for 
													the plaintiff. The parties 
													have not asked for a 
													reference as to damages and

													In the second suit the 
													plaintiff alleged a second 
													false imprisonment and 
													malicious prosecution

													Sergeant Akuoko and 
													Constable Peasah in the 
													following circumstances. The 
													plaintiff issued the writ of 
													summons in the first suit at 
													Accra on September 8, 1953. 
													Service was effected on the 
													defendants in that suit on 
													September 21 and 23. It will 
													be recalled that on August 
													26, the plaintiff, having 
													been arrested without 
													warrant, was released after 
													he had paid the </span>
													<span style="font-family: Arial">
													£2 8s. 0d. to the Local 
													Council Treasury. He was not 
													taken before a&nbsp; pg173 
													court within forty-eight 
													hours of arrest as the law 
													enjoins but, accord­ing to 
													the police diary, was told 
													he would be called upon when 
													wanted by the police. On 
													September 21, the plaintiff 
													was arrested without warrant 
													by the first defendant 
													Inspector Abaka and put in a 
													cell at Kukurantumi Police 
													Station for the night and 
													charged by the second 
													defendant Sergeant Akuoko on 
													the instruction of the first 
													defendant with attempted 
													stealing contra sections 44

													Code. On this charge the
