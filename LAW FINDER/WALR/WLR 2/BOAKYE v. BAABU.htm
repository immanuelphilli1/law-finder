													VERITY Ag.J.A. This is an 
													appeal from a judgment of 
													the Land Court, Kumnsi, 
													whereby on an appeal from a 
													Native Court of Appeal the 
													original judgment of a 
													Native Court of first 
													instance was restored. The 
													plaintiff had claimed a 
													declaration of title to 
													certain land which he 
													alleged had been granted to 
													him by the present occupier 
													of the Bare Stool. The 
													defendant averred that the 
													same land had been
													<font color="#FF0000">pg184
													</font>granted to her at an 
													earlier date by the previous 
													Barehene and the court of 
													first instance found in her 
													favour and dismissed the 
													plaintiff's claim. </span>
													</p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -5.8pt; margin-left: .95pt; margin-right: .2pt">
													<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
													The issue appears to have 
													been a simple one of fact, 
													for it was conceded before 
													us by counsel for the 
													plaintiff that if the ex-Barehene 
													had in fact previously 
													granted the land to the 
													defendant a subsequent grant 
													to the plaintiff by the 
													present occupier of the 
													Stool was of no effect. The 
													plaintiff contends, however, 
													that no such grant was made 
													to the defendant but that 
													when an offer of the land in 
													dispute was made to her in 
													addition to certain 
													adjoining land she had 
													rejected it on the ground 
													that the land was swampy and 
													unsuitable for cultivation. 
													The defendant's case is that 
													she at no time rejected the 
													area in dispute but that 
													when it was offered to her 
													she in common with others 
													who had been offered similar 
													land in that area reserved 
													the right to cultivate it 
													after they had finished 
													cultivating the higher 
													ground adjoining. </span>
													</p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -5.8pt; margin-left: .95pt; margin-right: .2pt">
													<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
													The court of first instance 
													in plain terms rejected the 
													evidence of the plaintiff 
													and his witnesses and 
													accepted that of the 
													defendant and her witnesses 
													on the ground that the 
													former was conflicting and 
													the latter &quot; very 
													corroborative.&quot; The Appeal 
													Court, however, after 
													visit­ing the locus in quo 
													(a course not pursued by the 
													trial court) allowed the 
													appeal on the ground that 
													the judgment of the trial 
													court was .. erroneous and 
													must be reversed,&quot; two 
													members of the Appeal Court 
													expressing the view that the 
													judgment of the court below 
													was not based on the 
													evidence. With this view the 
													learned judge of the Land 
													Court did not agree. </span>
													</p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -5.8pt; margin-left: .95pt; margin-right: .2pt">
													<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
													The Native Court of Appeal 
													appears to have based its 
													judgment largely on what its 
													members saw and heard on the 
													visit to the land, but I am 
													at a loss to understand why 
													they found such a visit 
													necessary, for neither the 
													location nor the area of the 
													land nor, indeed, its 
													boundaries were in doubt, 
													and it is difficult to see 
													how in the present case any 
													observation of its physical 
													feature could have assisted 
													them in coming to a 
													conclusion in relation to 
													the conflict of evidence in 
													the court below. Such visits 
													are in many cases useful: at 
													times they may be essential, 
													but they lie open to the 
													danger that the members of 
													the court may find 
													themselves in the position 
													of substitu­ting their own 
													observations for the sworn 
													testimony in matters which 
													cannot be determined 
													thereby. This is more 
													especially the case in 
													regard to an appeal court 
													which has not seen or heard 
													the witnesses under 
													examination by the more 
													orthodox methods of a trial 
													court. In the present case 
													the Appeal Court while 
													acknowledging the 
													established rule as to the 
													functions of such a court in 
													dealing with the findings of 
													the trial court appears to 
													have allowed itself to be 
													led astray by the ,events of 
													the visit, and in this I 
													think they fell into error.

													area. There was a conflict 
													of evidence which the trial 
													court was bound to resolve 
													and which it did resolve by 
													its judgment of the

													Having accepted as the more
