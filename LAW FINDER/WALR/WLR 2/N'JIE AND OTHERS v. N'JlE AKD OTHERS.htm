													This is a claim for recovery 
													of possession of certain 
													property at Basse known as 
													Ousman N'Jie Modji's yard. 
													The first plaintiff is the 
													widow, and the other three 
													plaintiffs are the daughters 
													of OusmrLll N'Jie Modji who 
													was the original owner of 
													the yard. The first 
													defendant is the ward of 
													Ousman N'Jie Modji and the 
													remaining three defendants 
													are the present occupiers of 
													different portions of the 
													property. </font></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.15pt; margin-right: -22.15pt">
													<font face="Arial">The 
													plaintiffs claim to be 
													entitled to the property by 
													native law and custom as the 
													descendants of Ousman N'Jie 
													Modji, who died on October 
													26, 1954. The defence is, 
													first, that the defendant, 
													Samba N'Jie, has a 
													prescriptive title to the 
													property by long possession, 
													and, secondly, that the 
													claim is res judicata.
													</font></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 16.3pt; margin-right: -22.15pt">
													<font face="Arial">I will 
													deal first with the defence 
													of long possession. It is 
													common ground that Ousman 
													N'Jie Modji ceased to reside 
													in the yard some time ago 
													and went to live in 
													Bathurst, but there is a 
													conflict of evidence as to 
													the exact year. It is also 
													common ground that Samba 
													N'Jie went to live in the 
													premises after Ousman's 
													departure, but there is a 
													dispute as to the 
													circumstances under which he 
													did so. It is not suggested 
													that any of the plaintiffs 
													lived in the yard after 
													Ousman N' Jie left. </font>
													</p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 16.3pt; margin-right: -22.15pt">
													<font face="Arial">With 
													regard to the dates, the 
													preponderance of the 
													evidence called on behalf of 
													the plaintiffs is to the 
													effect that Ousman left the 
													property during the second 
													year of the last war. Samba 
													N'Jie, however, says that 
													this took place as long as 
													twenty-five years ago. Samba 
													N'Jie is almost illiterate 
													and I am not prepared to 
													accept his statement on the 
													question of dates 
													particularly when it is not 
													supported by any evidence 
													whatsoever, and I accept the 
													evidence that Ousman N'Jie 
													went to Bathurst during the 
													second year of the war.
													</font></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 16.3pt; margin-right: -22.15pt">
													<font face="Arial">The 
													evidence for the plaintiffs 
													is that when Ousman left for 
													Bathurst he &quot; left&quot; his half 
													sister Njanha N'Dow in the 
													premises and that it was she 
													who called Samba N'Jie to 
													come and live there. There 
													is no doubt that at some 
													time Njanha N'Dow was living 
													in the property and also 
													that she left two or three 
													years before the end of the 
													war and went to Golda to see 
													her daughter Arnie who was 
													ill there. Njanha never 
													returned to Basse, and she 
													died at Golda. </font></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 17.25pt; margin-right: -22.15pt">
													<font face="Arial">Samba 
													N'Jie says that up to the 
													time that Ousman left he was 
													going to the yard but 
													sleeping at the premises of 
													his wife's family. He says 
													that Ousman on leaving for 
													Bathurst told him, Samba, to 
													bring his family to live in 
													the yard and that he was not 
													coming back. Samba says that 
													Njanha was not living in the 
													property at that time but 
													was at Golda where her 
													husband was residing. He 
													says that he brought her 
													from Colda because he had 
													heard that in future persons 
													living in French territory 
													would not be allowed to 
													leave the country. I think 
													Samba N'Jie is telling the 
													truth about this. After all, 
													he was the ward of Ousman 
													and had always been treated 
													by him as a son, and there 
													would be nothing surprising 
													in Ousman making an 
													arrangement of this kind 
													with him. </font></p>
													<p class="Style" style="margin-right: -22.15pt">
													<font face="Arial">The 
													question is, what is the 
													legal effect of this 
													arrangement? </font></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: -22.15pt">
													<font face="Arial">Samba 
													N'Jie seemed to regard it as 
													a gift of the land to 
													himself, but Mr. Forster 
													concedes that Samba became a 
													tenant-at-will of Ousman. 
													The plaintiffs' claim is 
													based upon the footing that 
													Samba N'Jie was a 
													tenant-at-will and I think 
													that is the true position. I 
													will therefore deal with the 
													case on this basis. In the 
													case of a tenancy-at-will 
													time commences to run 
													against the landlord either 
													at the determination of the 
													tenancy-at-will, or at the 
													end of one year from its 
													commencement, whichever 
													event first <i>happens-Fatou 
													N,'Jic </i>v. <i>Hall </i>
													(1). There was no demand for 
													possession until this year 
													and time began to run from 
													the beginning of the year 
													1942. I find therefore that 
													Samba N'Jie has been in 
													possession of the property 
													or part thereof at the 
													latest from the beginning of 
													the year 1941, without 
													payment of rent and has 
													exercised rights of 
													ownership over it. He has 
													thus acquired a good 
													possessory title. </font>

													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .2in; margin-right: -22.15pt">
													<font face="Arial">The 
													question has to be 
													considered, however, as to 
													how much of the original 
													property this possessory 
													title extends. It is clear 
													that the property today is 
													not in the condition in 
													which it was when Samba 
													N'Jie went into possession. 
													During the war a road was 
													constructed through the 
													property, dividing it in 
													half. Moreover, Samba N'Jie 
													has disposed of various 
													portions of the land. :Four 
													or five years ago he allowed 
													the defendant Mamadi Corra 
													to occupy part of the road 
													on the side on which he, 
													Samba, is living. Mamadi 
													Corra has built four houses, 
													together with a lavatory and 
													kitchen, and has fenced it 
													off. On the other side of 
													the road Samba N'Jie has 
													allowed the defendant Kumba 
													Kunaji to live, and she has 
													been there some nine years. 
													This land was also fenced 
													off. The remaining land on 
													this side of the road is now 
													occupied by the defendant 
													Lamin I(inteh and is also 
													fenced off. Samba states 
													that he gave it to one 
													Taylor a long time ago and 
													it is indicative of the 
													extent to which he has 
													divested himself of the 
													property that he does not 
													know either when or how 
													Lamin Kinteh went into 
													possession. The question is 
													what is the relationship in 
													law between Samba N'Jie and 
													the three other defendants. 
													In my opinion it is 
													precisely the same as that 
													between Samba N'Jie and 
													Ousman, that is they are 
													tenants-at-will. A 
													tenancy-at-will is a mere 
													personal relationship. The 
													tenant does not acquire a 
													transferable interest and 
													cannot sublet so as to 
													create an interest which can 
													be enforced against a third 
													party although he may create 
													a tenancy by estoppel 
													against himself. Samba N'Jie 
													therefore could not confer 
													an interest in the land 
													which can prevail against 
													the plaintiffs. These 
													defendants have been in 
													possession for less than 
													twelve years. The position 
													is therefore that Samba 
													N'Jie has only established a 
													possessory title to that 
													portion of the original 
													property whieh he now 
													occupies himself. I strongly 
													suspect that Samba N'Jie 
													sold the land to these 
													defendants although he 
													denies it, and that is the 
													reason why the other 
													defendants did not give 
													evidence. </font></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .2in; margin-right: -22.15pt">
													<font face="Arial">It 
													remains to deal with the 
													defence of res judicata. It 
													is the fact that in January 
													of this year the plaintiff 
													Fatou N'Jie instituted 
													pro­ceedings against Samba 
													N'Jie in the district court 
													of Fulladu East for the 
													recovery of this land and 
													the defendant was ordered to 
													quit within fourteen days. 
													There is no right of appeal 
													against the decision of a 
													native tribunal under the 
													District Tribunals 
													Ordinance, c. 49, but the 
													defendant applied to the 
													Commissioner to exercise his 
													powers of revision under 
													section 23 of the Ordinance. 
													The Commissioner reversed 
													the decision of the native 
													tribunal and ordered that 
													Samba should remain in 
													possession apart from a 
													small part which was to be 
													given to the plaintiff. The 
													short answer to the plea of 
													res judicata is that the 
													proceedings before the 
													native tribunal were not 
													between the same parties as 
													the present. The other three 
													plaintiffs were not parties 
													to the original proceedings 
													and they cannot be said to 
													be the privies of Fatou 
													N'Jie since they are not 
													claiming through her but in 
													their own right. </font>
