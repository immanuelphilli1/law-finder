												VERITY Ag.J.A. In this case the 
												Attorney-General on behalf of 
												the Government of the Gold 
												Coast, sought to recover first a 
												balance due and owing under an 
												agreement for a loan and 
												secondly the balance due under a 
												deed of assignment made in 
												consideration of an advance made 
												to the defendant for the 
												purchase of a motor-car. The

												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.6pt; margin-left: .45pt; margin-right: .2pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The facts stated briefly are 
												that the defendant, a qualified 
												doctor, was employed by the 
												Government as a house surgeon 
												for a period of .twelve months 
												with the prospect of appointment 
												as a medical officer at the end 
												thereof. An advance was made by 
												the Government to the defendant 
												of £745 for the purchase of a 
												motor-car and in consideration 
												thereof the defendant executed a 
												deed of assignment of the 
												motor-car purchased by him, by 
												way of security for the 
												repayment of the advance. By the 
												terms thereof the defendant 
												undertook to repay the advance 
												by monthly instalments of £15 
												l0s. 5d. and the deed further 
												provided that if the defendant 
												left the Government service 
												before the advance was repaid in 
												full the balance outstanding 
												should become due and payable 
												forthwith. It was further 
												provided that the Government 
												would not seize the vehicle 
												unless (inter alia) the 
												defendant made default in 
												repayment of the advance. </span>
												</p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.6pt; margin-left: .45pt; margin-right: .2pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Upon the expiration of the 
												period of twelve months the 
												Government informed the 
												defendant it was not proposed to 
												renew his appointment or offer 
												him further employment and the 
												defendant was called upon to 
												repay the balance of the advance 
												outstanding which then amounted 
												to £543 4s. 7d. </span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.6pt; margin-left: .45pt; margin-right: .2pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The defendant made verbal 
												request to be allowed to retain 
												the use of the car and continue 
												repayment by instalments. On 
												January 4, 1954, the Government 
												informed him that his request 
												could not be
												<font color="#FF0000">pg 240
												</font>granted and the letter in 
												which this decision was 
												intimated to the defendant 
												continued: </span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 15.6pt; margin-left: 19.4pt; margin-right: .2pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; In view of this I have to 
												request you to pay to the 
												District Treasury, .Accra, the 
												outstanding balance or 
												alternatively to hand the car 
												over to the Chief Transport 
												Officer, Accra. I have to 
												request that you complete action 
												on one of these courses within 
												ten days from the date of this 
												letter, failing which the 
												Government will have no 
												alternative but to invoke clause 
												6 of the Deed of Assignment 
												entered into by you and take 
												possession of the car.&quot; </span>
												</p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.6pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The defendant complied with the 
												alternative course offered him 
												and delivered the car to the 
												Transport Officer within the 
												required time, i.e., on January 
												15, 1954. On February 17, 1954, 
												the then Transport Officer 
												valued the car at £425. No 
												instructions were given him for 
												sale until May, no action 
												appears to have been taken to 
												sell the car until September and 
												it was eventually sold on 
												October 6, 1954, for £150. 
												During the period of nearly nine 
												months between surrender and 
												sale the car had been kept in an 
												open shed in the Government 
												Transport Yard. </span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.6pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On November 26 the defendant was 
												called upon to pay the balance 
												which had been outstanding on 
												January 1 less the net proceeds 
												of the sale, £145 13s. 4d. This 
												the defendant declined to pay 
												and this action was taken.
												</span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.6pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It was contended at the trial 
												that the defendant had been 
												offered alternative courses; 
												either to pay the balance or 
												surrender the car and that there 
												had been no seizure in pursuance 
												of clause 6 of the deed of 
												assignment. The learned judge 
												does not appear to have 
												considered this aspect of the 
												matter and for other reasons 
												which I do not think now arise 
												entered judgment for the 
												plaintiff. </span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.6pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												At the hearing of the appeal the 
												principal ground argued was that 
												by the letter of January 4, 
												1954, the Government offered to 
												vary the terms of the deed of 
												assignment by substituting as an 
												alternative to payment of the 
												balance outstanding within ten 
												days, surrender of the car 
												within that period and that by 
												surrendering the car the 
												defendant accepted the offer and 
												was discharged from further 
												obligation. </span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.6pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I am of the opinion that this 
												contention is well founded. The 
												position on January 4, 1954, 
												under the deed of assignment was 
												that the defendant was under 
												obligation to repay the 
												outstanding advance forth­with 
												(clause 5); if he made default 
												the Government were entitled to 
												seize and sell the car (clause 
												6). By the letter of that date, 
												however, the Government made a 
												clear offer to the defendant of 
												an alternative to his obligation 
												under clause 5 and that this was 
												intended to be in substitution 
												for the seizure of the car under 
												clause 6 is demonstrated by the 
												fact that it was specifically 
												stated that if the defendant did 
												not comply with either 
												alternative within ten days the 
												Government would invoke clause 
												6. <font color="#FF0000">pg 241

												<div class="Section10">
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.85pt; margin-left: .2pt; margin-right: .25pt">
													<span style="font-family: Arial">
													This amounts, in my view, to 
													an offer to waive the rights 
													of the Government under 
													clause 6 provided that the 
													defendant either paid the 
													amount outstanding or 
													surrendered the car, and 
													upon the compliance of the 
													defendant he was discharged 
													from all further obligations 
													and cannot now be called 
													upon to pay the difference

													and that realized by the 
													sale nine months later.

													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.85pt; margin-left: .2pt; margin-right: .25pt">
													<span style="font-family: Arial">
													The conduct of the 
													Government after the car had 
													been surrendered in delaying 
													for so many months the sale 
													thereof without 
													communicating with the 
													defendant in any way can 
													only be regarded either as 
													gross lack of consideration 
													for the interests of the 
													defendant or an 
													acknow­ledgment that the 
													defendant no longer had any 
													interest therein or in the 
													proceeds of sale, and if it 
													were necessary for the 
													purpose of construing the 
													meaning and effect of the 
													letter of January 4 I would

													Counsel for the respondent, 
													who had not appeared at the 
													trial, frankly, and I think 
													very properly, conceded that 
													he had been unable to find 
													any authority in favour of 
													the respondent's claim in 
													these circumstances. </span>

													I think, therefore, that the 
													learned judge erred in 
													holding that the defendant 
													remained under any 
													obligation after his 
													acceptance and com­pliance 
													with the alternative course 
													made open to him by the 
													Govern­ment's offer of 
													January 4, 1954, and that 
													the appeal should therefore 
													be allowed with costs, the 
													judgment of the court below 
													being set aside and judgment 
													entered therein for the 
													defendant with costs to be 
													taxed. </span></p>

													By grounds 8, 9 and 10 of 
													the grounds of appeal it was 
													set up that the Deed of 
													Assignment was unenforceable 
													by reason of the provisions 
													of the Bills of Sale Acts, 
													and we were invited by 
													counsel for the Crown to 
													indicate our view on this 
													question. Upon it being 
													pointed out that the Bills 
													of Sale Acts 1878-1882 are 
													not in force in the Gold 
													Coast and that the Bills of 
													Sale Act, 1854, does not 
													appear to be applicable to 
													the present case, counsel 
													for the appellant abandoned 
													those grounds and the point 
													does not therefore fall for 
													decision in the appeal 
													before us. </span></p>
