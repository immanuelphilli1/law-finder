												<font face="Arial">DE1\NISON J. 
												The plaintiff claims damages for 
												wrongful dismissal from his 
												contract of employment; the 
												terms of the contract are set 
												out in an agreement. For the 
												defendants, it is alleged that 
												the dismissal was justified on 
												the grounds of misconduct; the 
												statement of defence did not 
												contain any particulars 
												regarding the details of the 
												misconduct. Fuller and better 
												particulars were not asked for 
												by the plaintiff, this is due, 
												no doubt, to the asked-for 
												particulars being given to his 
												solicitors in a letter. </font>
												</p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 13.9pt; margin-right: -22.15pt">
												<font face="Arial">From the 
												evidence it appears that the 
												misconduct for which the 
												plaintiff was dismissed was his 
												disobedience to the order to 
												hand over work to Mr. Jaffka. He 
												was ordered to do so in two 
												letters written by Dr. Busby, a 
												director of the defendant 
												company. The firm has no 
												managing director, but Dr. Busby 
												stated that at the various 
												meetings of the company he was 
												always elected as chairman of 
												the directors, in any event I am 
												satisfied that he was in a 
												position to issue lawful orders 
												on behalf of the company to its 
												servants. <font color="#FF0000">

												<div class="Section4">
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 15.1pt; margin-right: -22.15pt">
													<font face="Arial">The 
													plaintiff raised the point 
													that he was a &quot; proxy&quot; for 
													another director, Dr. Lucas, 
													who is in England; whether 
													he was or not is of no 
													importance because as he 
													sues on his agreement he is 
													bound by it and particularly 
													by paragraph 15 thereof.
													</font></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 15.1pt; margin-right: -22.15pt">
													<font face="Arial">There is 
													no evidence to show whether 
													or not the plaintiff ever 
													had the overseas leave due 
													to him under the agreement. 
													By reason of his application 
													for leave dated March 3, 
													1956, it would appear not, 
													so that contrary to his 
													evidence he was due for 
													leave last March. </font>
													</p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 15.1pt; margin-right: -22.15pt">
													<font face="Arial">As 
													stated, the letters sent to 
													him by Dr. Busby contain the 
													order to the plaintiff to 
													hand over his duties to 
													another; further, the letter 
													sent to his solicitors 
													ordered him to attend a 
													meeting of the directors and 
													this he also failed to do. 
													For both these failures to 
													obey orders the plaintiff 
													endeavoured to excuse 
													himself on the grounds that 
													in each case the notices 
													were too short. I consider 
													that it was not for him to 
													argue about the shortage of 
													notice. If his handing over 
													was incomplete, or if the 
													company lost stores through 
													his being absent from the 
													site, that was their own 
													responsibility in the 
													circumstances. </font></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 15.1pt; margin-right: -22.15pt">
													<font face="Arial">It is the 
													case for the plaintiff that 
													he was not bound to obey 
													these orders in that they 
													were so unreasonable as to 
													be unlawful. I have no doubt 
													at all that when the 
													plaintiff received Dr. 
													Busby's second letter he 
													knew perfectly well the 
													capacity in which Dr. Busby 
													was acting, and also that he 
													knew full well he was 
													expected to take his leave 
													to Trinidad. </font></p>

													(2), at the said p. 276 of 
													the report Lord Thankerton, 
													in delivering the judgment 
													of their Lordships, referred
