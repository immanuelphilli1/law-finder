                                                occurred at that interview. The

                                                took them down, and made It 
                                                copy. The solicitor's clerk,

                                                the proof taken by the solicitor 
                                                was inaccurate, and as their

                                                court thought that he was blind 
                                                within the meaning of the 
                                                relevant order, and that as the 
                                                document had not been read over 
                                                to him there was not sufficient 
                                                evidence to show that he knew of 
                                                its contents. The court of 
                                                appeal, on the other hand, took 
                                                the view that there was

                                                <font face="Arial">It is quite 
                                                true that there has been some 
                                                difficulty owing to the 
                                                production of two documents, 
                                                both of which are signed and 
                                                purport, as Mr. Ramsay quite 
                                                rightly says, to be witnessed by 
                                                the same gentlemen. If their 
                                                Lordships had to speculate upon 
                                                the matter they would be 
                                                inclined to say that one was 
                                                meant to be a copy of the other, 
                                                one to be the will and the other 
                                                to be a copy for the testator to 
                                                keep, but there is no reason why 
                                                they should have to speculate in 
                                                this matter. Except for the 
                                                omission of a certain gift, 
                                                which might well occur in a case 
                                                where there is a long list of 
                                                persons to whom gifts were 
                                                given, for all practical 
                                                purposes the above documents are 
                                                similar. That the one which has 
                                                been numbered P1. is the true 
                                                will appears from the fact that 
                                                it was by the express wish of 
                                                the testator deposited with the 
                                                court, and therefore was meant 
                                                to be the formal document which 
                                                should bind the estate. </font>
