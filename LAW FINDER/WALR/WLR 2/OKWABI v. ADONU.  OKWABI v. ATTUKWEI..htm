												C.J. This is an appeal from the

												two consolidated suits in which 
												the plaintiff, for himself and 
												on behalf of his family, which 
												is described as &quot; the maternal 
												family of the late Numo Kortey 
												Kofi deceased,&quot; sued each of the 
												two defendants in respect of the 
												same piece of land for (a) 
												damages for trespass, (b)

												With regard to the suit against 
												Nii Attnkwei the plaintiff 
												further claimed a declaration of 
												title to the said land. It is 
												admitted by the defendants that 
												they are occupying portions of 
												the said land, but Awomi Adonu, 
												the defendant in the first suit, 
												contends that he was on the land 
												by leave and licence of Nii 
												Attnkwei, whose tenant he has 
												been for many years. Nii 
												Attukwei, the defendant in the 
												second suit, contends that the 
												land, the subject­matter of the 
												suit, was acquired jointly by 
												himself and his late father, 
												Kumo Kortey Kofi, and that by 
												the act and deed of his late 
												father, the said land was

													The plaintiff says that 
													since the death of the 
													testator he has been in 
													possession of the said land 
													and that his agents have 
													been collecting rents from 
													tenants on the land, 
													including Awomi Adonu who, 
													during the testator's 
													lifetime, was one of his 
													tenants. With regard to the 
													defendant Nii Attukwei, the 
													plaintiff says that he, Nii 
													Attukwei, was on the land by 
													virtue of the fact that he 
													was the son of the testator; 
													that from childhood he lived 
													with his father, who after 
													he purchased the said land 
													occupied it until his death 
													with his son Nii Attukwei; 
													that Nii Attukwei now 
													disputes plaintiff's 
													ownership of the said land 
													by virtue of the will, and 
													has been molesting the 
													plaintiff's other licensees 
													on the land and instigating 
													the plaintiff's tenant, 
													Awomi Adonu, to refuse to 
													pay tolls or rents to 
													plaintiff; and that this 
													defendant entered upon 
													portions of the land 
													occupied by the plaintiff's 
													other tenants and licensees 
													and destroyed structures 
													built by them. </span></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.6pt; margin-left: 1.9pt; margin-right: .25pt">
													<span style="font-family: Arial">
													The main issue therefore was 
													whether the land was the 
													self-acquired property of 
													the testator or was acquired 
													jointly by the testator and 
													the defendant Nii Attukwei, 
													as alleged by him. Nii 
													Attukwei based his claim of 
													joint ownership of the land 
													with his father, the 
													testator, on the fact that 
													he had lived with his father 
													from his childhood, and 
													worked with his father in 
													several places as a farmer, 
													during which period the 
													father kept all the proceeds 
													of their labours as a common 
													purse belonging to both of 
													them, and that when he 
													married he con­tinued to 
													work with his father, and 
													contributed money for the 
													purchase of the said land. 
													On this issue the learned 
													trial judge stated in his 
													judgment: </span></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.85pt; margin-left: 20.85pt; margin-right: .5pt">
													<span style="font-family: Arial">
													&quot; It is clear to me from the 
													evidence of the defendant 
													that if he did work with his 
													father, who was a farmer, he 
													was doing what any child 
													would do in this country for 
													his father. Whatever 
													proceeds accrued from the 
													efforts of father and son 
													are not the joint property 
													of the father and the son.
													</span></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.85pt; margin-left: 20.85pt; margin-right: .5pt">
													<span style="font-family: Arial">
													&quot;Strong evidence should be 
													forthcoming to prove that a 
													particular portion of the 
													proceeds was earmarked as 
													the property of the son and 
													that that amount was 
													utilised by the father in 
													acquiring a particular 
													property. That evidence has 
													not been forthcoming from 
													the defendant. I do not also 
													accept the evidence that the 
													defendant contributed any 
													money towards the land in 
													dispute. &quot; </span></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.6pt; margin-left: 1.9pt; margin-right: .25pt">
													<span style="font-family: Arial">
													In my view this conclusion 
													reached by the learned trial 
													judge is amply supported by 
													the evidence, and 
													consequently disposes of the 
													contention of Nii Attukwei 
													that the land in question 
													was acquired jointly by him 
													and his father. The 
													defendant's further 
													contention that the land was 
													by the act and deed of the 
													testator attached to a stool 
													created by testator for him, 
													the defendant, was rightly 
													rejected by the trial court.
													</span></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.6pt; margin-left: 1.9pt; margin-right: .25pt">
													<span style="font-family: Arial">
													It is alleged that Numo 
													Kortey Kofi requested the 
													Asere Manche to create Nii 
													Attukwei Manche or chief of 
													Medie village, and that in&nbsp;
													<font color="#FF0000">pg 271
													</font></span></div>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												compliance with this request the 
												Asere Manche went to Medie and 
												created the defendant, Nii 
												Attukwei, chief. Counsel for the 
												defendant admitted before this 
												court that Medie village is not 
												within the terri­torial 
												jurisdiction of the Ga State in 
												which Asere Manche is a 
												sub­chief; it is not disputed 
												that even a Paramount Chief of 
												one State could not go to 
												another State and create a chief 
												there, or even perform 
												ceremonies appertaining to the 
												enstoolment of a chief without 
												the authority of the chief of 
												that territory. The members of 
												the testator's family denied any 
												knowledge of such act by the 
												testator, who by his last will 
												and testament, made some years 
												after the alleged incident, 
												devised the property to his 
												maternal family, of which
