													The case arose out of a 
													civil suit instituted by the 
													defendant against one Kwame 
													Noah, as principal debtor, 
													and the plaintiff in the 
													present suit as a surety, in 
													which the claim against them 
													jointly and severally was 
													for a sum of money due and 
													owing. The defendant, who 
													was plaintiff in that suit, 
													obtained a judgment and 
													proceeded to execution 
													whereby a cocoa farm, the 
													property of the plaintiff in 
													the present suit, was sold 
													under a process of fl. fa. 
													and bought by one Kwabena 
													Gyasi. There is no dispute 
													that the plaintiff, who was 
													the second defendant in the 
													case, never appeared at any 
													stage of the proceedings. 
													She now alleges that the 
													writ of summons in the case 
													had not been served on her 
													and maintains therefore that 
													the judgment recovered 
													against her was a nullity, 
													and that being so the sale 
													of her cocoa farm in 
													execution of a null decree 
													against her cannot validly 
													affect her interest in her 
													said property. Her action, 
													commenced in the same Native 
													Court, is as follows: </span>
													</p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-indent: -5.8pt; margin-left: 23.5pt; margin-right: 1.45pt" align="justify">

													the properties of Kwame Gyan 
													on one side, on one side 
													with Kwame Kumah's cocoa 
													farm, on one side with Madam 
													Fosuaah's cocoa farm and on 
													the other side by Kwaku 
													Sraha's cocoa farm, the 
													property&quot; ot the plaintiff,

													<p class="Style" style="text-indent: -5.8pt; margin-left: 4.55pt; margin-right: .5pt" align="justify">

													The issue which the Native 
													Court tried in this case is 
													whether the writ of summons 
													in which the present 
													plaintiff was sued before 
													the court was in fact served 
													on her. It is a settled rule 
													of law and practice that no 
													court of law can give 
													judgment against a party in 
													a suit in which a copy of 
													the writ of summons has not 
													been served on the party 
													concerned. Regulation 49 of 
													the Native Court (Colony) 
													Procedure Regulations, No. 
													10 of 1945 as amended by the 
													Native Court (Colony) 
													Procedure (Amendment) 
													Regulations, No.8 of 1950, 
													made under the Native Courts 
													Ordinance, c. 98 of 1951, 
													puts it as follows: </span>
													</p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-indent: -5.8pt; margin-left: 23.5pt; margin-right: 1.45pt" align="justify">
													<span style="font-family: Arial">
													., The Native Court shall 
													not take any action which is 
													depen­dent upon process 
													having been served unless 
													service is admitted by the 
													person concerned or service 
													has been proved. &quot; </span>
													</p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-indent: -5.8pt; margin-left: 4.55pt; margin-right: .5pt" align="justify">
													<span style="font-family: Arial">
													Apart from the denial by the 
													plaintiff of service of the 
													writ of summons on her there 
													is other evidence, such as 
													her absence in Kumasi and 
													thereby from jurisdiction at 
													the material time, in 
													support of her contention 
													that she had not been 
													served. It therefore becomes
													<font color="#FF0000">pg166
													</font>incumbent on the 
													defendant to establish 
													satisfactorily that service 
													of a copy of the writ of 
													summons had been effected on 
													the plaintiff before the 
													case proceeded against her.

													<p class="Style" style="text-indent: -5.8pt; margin-right: .7pt" align="justify">
													<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
													1)roof of service is 
													provided for by regulation 
													48 of the above-named 
													Regulations as follows:
													</span></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-indent: -5.8pt; margin-left: 19.4pt; margin-right: .45pt" align="justify">
													<span style="font-family: Arial">
													&quot; Service effected by a 
													bailiff or native authority 
													policeman may be proved by 
													evidence on oath or by a 
													certificate of service on 
													the original document signed 
													by the person effecting 
													service. Service effected by 
													any other person shall be 
													proved by evidence on oath.&quot;
													</span></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-indent: -5.8pt; margin-left: .7pt; margin-right: .2pt" align="justify">
													<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
													I am of the opinion that 
													where proof of service is in 
													issue in another suit it is 
													necessary to produce the 
													best evidence, and that is 
													to call the person entrusted 
													with service to give 
													evidence on oath and to be 
													cross-examined, unless such 
													person is not available or 
													cannot be pro­cured. This 
													will afford an opportunity 
													for the trial court to 
													determine the authenticity 
													or otherwise of any 
													certificate of service that 
													might have been endorsed on 
													the original document.
													</span></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-indent: -5.8pt; margin-left: .7pt; margin-right: .2pt" align="justify">
													<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
													In answer to the case made 
													by the plaintiff in this 
													case the defendant did not 
													call the bailiff who 
													purported to have effected 
													service in the suit. 
													Furthermore there is no 
													satisfactory certificate of 
													service on the person of the 
													plaintiff, as is required by 
													Regulation 45 of the 
													Regulations above-named, to 
													be found on the original 
													document. The only 
													indication approximating to 
													such a certificate&quot; is an 
													entry at the foot of the 
													original document as 
													follows: </span></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-indent: -5.8pt; margin-left: .2in; margin-right: 81.35pt" align="justify">
													<span style="font-family: Arial">

													<p class="Style" style="text-indent: -5.8pt; margin-left: .45pt; margin-right: .7pt" align="justify">
													<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
													In fact there is to be found 
													nowhere on the original 
													document the usual form of 
													certificate of service.
													</span></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-indent: -5.8pt; margin-left: .7pt; margin-right: .2pt" align="justify">
													<span style="font-family: Arial">
													A close study of the 
													original document discloses 
													that the plaintiff was not 
													even cited for service and 
													it must therefore be 
													presumed that no copy of the 
													writ of summons was ever 
													addressed to her for 
													service. The Native Trial 
													Court appears to have 
													accepted hearsay evidence 
													from a witness, Benign, who 
													was the recorder of the 
													proceedings in the case to 
													the effect that the bailiff 
													who had been entrusted with 
													service had reported service 
													to him. to reason appears 
													why the bailiff himself did 
													not give evidence. </span>

													I am of the opinion

													the plaintiff is 
													unsatisfactory and that the

												Land Court, Cape Coast, was of
