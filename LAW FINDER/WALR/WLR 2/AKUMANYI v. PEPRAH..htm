												This is an appeal from a

												Court constituted by the 
												Government Agent, Winneba, 
												sitting as an appeal court on a 
												judgment of the Native Court &quot;B 
												&quot; of Gomoa Ajumako. The claim 
												made by the plaintiff before the 
												Native Court in substance is for 
												a declaration that he had been 
												properly appointed as successor 
												to two deceased members of his 
												family. </font></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.6pt; margin-right: -22.15pt">
												<font face="Arial">The defences 
												to that claim were first, that 
												Kwami Nyame, who had made the 
												appointment, was not the head of 
												the family, the Ayensuadzi 'l'widan 
												family; second, that the 
												defendant was a senior member of 
												the family, in fact the head of 
												the family, and therefore the 
												plaintiff's appointment by Kwame 
												Nyame was void; and third, that 
												in any event the matter was res 
												judicata by reason of two 
												arbitrations, one held by the 
												Oman of Ayensuadzi and the other 
												by the Omanhene of Gomoa Ajumako 
												State. The Native Court gave 
												judgment for the plaintiff, 
												holding that his appointment was 
												in accordance with native custom 
												and that the acts of the Oman of 
												Ayensuadzi and of the Omanhene 
												of Gomoa Ajumako cannot operate 
												as res judicata. The defendant's 
												appeal to the Magistrate's Court 
												was dismissed and his counsel

													<font face="Arial">Five 
													grounds of appeal were 
													filed. Mr. Benjamin, for the 
													defendant, abandoned the 
													first and the fifth of those 
													grounds and argue the 
													second, third and fourth. 
													The third ground is that the 
													judgment is against the 
													weight of evidence, and the 
													fourth is that the judgment 
													is contrary to Native 
													Custom. </font></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .2in; margin-right: -22.15pt">
													<font face="Arial">As to the 
													weight of evidence, I must 
													say at once that counsel ha 
													not been able to show that 
													this case comes within the 
													exception where a court of 
													appeal will be entitled to 
													set aside findings of fac 
													made by a court of first 
													instance and substitute its 
													own finding upon the 
													evidence. There is therefore 
													no substance in that ground.
													</font></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-indent: 15.35pt; margin-right: -22.15pt">
													<font face="Arial">On the 
													third ground counsel 
													referred me to Sarbah, Fanf 
													Customary Laws, 2nd ed., pp. 
													101-102, and in reply to 
													submission: made by counsel 
													for the plaintiff to 
													paragraph 2 of p. 104 of the 
													sam book. He argued that 
													since the plaintiff admitted 
													himself to b younger in age 
													than the defendant, his, the 
													plaintiff's appointment&nbsp; 
													succeed to the deceased 
													members of the family in 
													preference to th defendant, 
													was contrary to custom as 
													laid down in Sarbah. Mr. 
													Sekvt counsel for the 
													plaintiff, in reply to this 
													argument referred the <i>
													co~J </i>to pp. 104-105 of 
													Sarbah, where it is stated 
													that as between nephew~; 
													entitled to succeed, the son 
													of the elder sister though 
													younger in a~ than the son 
													of the younger sister has 
													preference in the matter d 
													succession to the estate of 
													a deceased uncle. The Native 
													Court faun: as a fact that 
													the custom of the area where 
													the case arose is that 
													between nephews the 
													seniority must be determined 
													by the seniority' of their 
													mothers. I cannot interfere 
													with that finding of fact, 
													paticularly as the passages 
													in Sarbah to which I have 
													been referred b<sup>'</sup> 
													learned counsel for both 
													sides seem to conflict. In 
													any case succession' is not 
													absolutely as of right. The 
													family are entitled to 
													appoint younger man to 
													supersede an elder member in 
													certain cases. It I, clear 
													on the evidence led for both 
													sides that the appointment 
													of th! plaintiff was with 
													the concurrence of the 
													members of the family~ The 
													appeal therefore cannot 
													succeed on the fourth ground 
													of appeal </font></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .2in; margin-right: -22.15pt">
													<font face="Arial">The 
													second ground of appeal 
													raises a question of law, 
													namely that the claim is res 
													judicata by reason of the 
													fact that the matter had 
													bee: finally decided at two 
													arbitrations, one by the 
													Oman and the other~ by the 
													Omanhene as stated above. To 
													uphold this contention I 
													must I be satisfied among 
													other things that there has 
													been an arbitration' 
													properly so called, i.e. a 
													valid arbitration, that the 
													parties to t arbitration are 
													the same as the parties to 
													the suit before me and, that 
													the issues raised in this 
													suit are substantially the 
													same as the~ determined at 
													the arbitration. Learned 
													counsel for the defender has 
													not been able to satisfy me 
													on these points. It is not 
													enough to say that there has 
													been an arbitration. If a 
													party relies upon an 
													arbitration as a defiance he 
													must prove that there was a 
													prop submission of the 
													dispute, that the parties

													<font color="#FF0000">pg115
													</font>the defendant never 
													put his defence of 
													arbitration to the plaintiff 
													and his witnesses in order 
													that the Native Court might 
													have opportunity to 
													investigate it properly. The 
													matter was only clearly 
													raised when the defence came 
													on. Moreover the account of 
													the arbitration as given by 
													the Omanhene, the fourth 
													witness for the defence, is 
													materially different from 
													that given by the defendant 
													himself. Also it is not 
													clear who the parties were 
													to the two arbitrations; it 
													appears from the evidence of 
													most of the witnesses that 
													Kwami Nyame, the head of the 
													family, and the defendant, 
													but not the plaintiff and 
													the defendant&quot; were the 
													parties at the so called 
													arbitration. Also, as to the 
													issue before the so called 
													arbitration it appears that 
													the headship of the family 
													was the issue dealt with.
