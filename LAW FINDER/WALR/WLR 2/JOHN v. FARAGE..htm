												the defendant on account of the 
												hire of a motor lorry No. 0072 
												and there is a claim for damages

												alleged that the lorry was in a 
												defective condition. 'l'he lorry 
												was hired by the plaintiff from 
												the defendant for three months 
												com­mencing on December 2, 1055, 
												under an oral agreement. There 
												is a conflict of evidence as to 
												whether the rate of hire was £3' 
												1013. per day or £350 for the 
												period but in view of the 
												conclusion to which I have come 
												it is unnecessary to go into 
												this issue. A written agreement

												but the plaintiff refused to 
												sign it because it contained a 
												provision that the plaintiff 
												should be responsible for the

												<font face="Arial">'rhe lorry 
												was delivered to the plaintiff 
												at Jawara on December 10, HJ55. 
												It was accompanied by a driver 
												supplied by the defendant who 
												has now gone to the Senegal and 
												cannot be traced, and also a 
												mechanic, Lamin Bah, who was 
												called as a witness on behalf of 
												the plaintiff. According to the 
												plaintiff, there was trouble 
												with the gears on December 11, 
												1955; on the 12th it broke down 
												again but the cause of the 
												trouble has not been 
												ascertained. The plaintiff says 
												it had cut-out trouble on the 
												13th. On the 14th it worked 
												without breaking down but on the 
												15th the battery ran down. The 
												plaintiff accordingly decided to 
												return the lorry to the 
												defendant on December 17, and he 
												determined the hiring. The 
												plaintiff says that he had an 
												interview with the defendant on 
												December 12 at Bathurst but this 
												is denied by the defendant. The 
												plaintiff was not a satisfactory 
												witness and I prefer the 
												evidence of the defendant who 
												says that he did not see the 
												plaintiff until after the end of 
												the trade season. </font></p>

												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 15.1pt; margin-right: -22.15pt">

												<font face="Arial"><i>per </i>
												Lord Abinger in <i>Sutton </i>v.
												<i>Temple </i>(1) at p. 60. The 
												question is whether the 
												plaintiff has proved that the 
												condition of the lorry was such 
												that it was not reasonably 
												satisfactory for the purpose for 
												which it was hired. In my 
												opinion the plaintiff's case 
												breaks down on the evidence 
												which he himself has adduced. 
												The plaintiff is not a mechanic 
												and his evidence as to the 
												various breakdowns is vague in 
												the extreme and would not 
												warrant my acting upon it alone. 
												The only persons who would be in 
												a position to speak on this 
												matter are the driver, who is 
												not now available, and the 
												mechanic, Lamin Bah, who has 
												given evidence. According to the 
												mechanic the only defect was in 
												the head lights, of which the 
												bulbs were useless. He says that 
												the plaintiff decided to return 
												the lorry to Bathurst because 
												the driver refused to work the 
												lorry at night without lights. 
												There would have been no 
												difficulty in obtaining spare 
												bulbs at Bathurst and if this 
												was the only thing wrong it 
												certainly did not render the 
												lorry unsatisfactory for the 
												purpose for which it was hired 
												nor justify the plaintiff in 
												determining the hiring. </font>
												</p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 15.1pt; margin-right: -22.15pt">
												<font face="Arial">The matter 
												does not rest there, however, 
												because after the plaintiff 
												determined the hiring the lorry 
												was hired to one Momodou Drammeh 
												for the trade season and was 
												worked for him from December 18, 
												1955, until April 18, 1956. 
												Momodou Drammeh was called by 
												the plaintiff and said that 
												during the whole of that period 
												the lorry never broke down on a 
												single occasion. Mr. Forster has 
												argued that it is unlikely that 
												the plaintiff would have taken 
												the drastic step of determining 
												the hiring if all the lorry 
												needed was a couple of head 
												lights, but even if there were 
												other defects they could not 
												have been very serious, because 
												as previously stated, the lorry 
												worked without any trouble for 
												the whole of the trade season. 
												There is no evidence that any 
												repairs were done to the lorry 
												between the 16th and 18th 
												December. If there were any 
												other defects apart from the 
												bulbs they were not sufficient 
												to amount to a breach of 
												warranty so as to justify the 
												plaintiff in determining the 
												hiring. </font></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 15.1pt; margin-right: -22.15pt">
												<font face="Arial">The plaintiff 
												has failed to prove to my 
												satisfaction on the facts that 
												the lorry at the time of the 
												hiring or during the time that 
												it was in the possession of the 
												plaintiff was in such a 
												defective condition as to amount 
												to a breach of warranty. The 
												claim for damages accordingly 
												fails. There was not a total 
												failure of consideration and the 
												plaintiff is not entitled to the 
												return of the money which he had 
												advanced. There will be judgment 
												for the defendant with costs.
