                                                his family, sought to recover 
                                                the rents of certain family 
                                                properties that were leased to 
                                                the first defendants. The second 
                                                defendant c1aimed to be the duly 
                                                appointed head of the family and 
                                                as such to be the person 
                                                properly entitled to administer 
                                                the family property. It appeared 
                                                from the evidence that the 
                                                second defendant at one time had 
                                                been the head but had been 
                                                relieved of his office by the 
                                                family who, at a family meeting, 
                                                appointed the plaintiff and one 
                                                Thompson (since deceased) to 
                                                administer the family property 
                                                in his should. Subsequently, at 
                                                another family meeting, the 
                                                second defendant (jointly with 
                                                another person) was reappointed 
                                                head of the family. This led to 
                                                litigation between the two 
                                                factions in two suits that were 
                                                heard before a Native Court. In 
                                                the first suit judgment was 
                                                given for Welbeck and Thompson; 
                                                in the second suit for Hammond 
                                                and his co-head, but this latter 
                                                decision was reversed on appeal 
                                                on the grounds that the issue 
                                                was res judicata by virtue of 
                                                the first Native Court judgment. 
                                                This was followed by another 
                                                family meeting which certain 
                                                principal members of one branch 
                                                of the family, supporters of 
                                                Welbeck, refused to attend. At 
                                                this meeting a resolution was 
                                                passed appointing Hammond head 
                                                of the family. For the plaintiff 
                                                Welbeck it was argued that a 
                                                dispute existed between the two 
                                                branches of the family; that 
                                                these branches had not been 
                                                reconciled, as they should have

                                                and, that the absence of 
                                                principal members of the family 
                                                from the meeting that appointed

                                                on the facts, as it was 
                                                unreasonable for a member of the 
                                                family deliberately to avoid 
                                                attending a meeting and thus 
                                                hold up the making of an 
                                                appointment. Mr. Bossman, 
                                                however, argued that there must 
                                                be a move to reconciliation and 
                                                pacification of the rival 
                                                elements of a family before a 
                                                meeting can be held to make an 
                                                appointment. He cited the 
                                                decision of Quashie-Idun (then 
                                                acting judge) in <i>Ankrah </i>

                                                distinguishable in that it only 
                                                goes so far as to lay down that 
                                                where two opposing sections of a 
                                                family have subsequently become 
                                                reconciled, a meeting of one or

                                                cannot appoint or remove a head 
                                                of family. Such an act can only

                                                signatories to the document of

                                                I think for the plaintiff to

                                                representative and that members 
                                                were absent whose presence was 
                                                indispensable. AU that I have is 
                                                the suggestion by the plaintiff

                                              connected with the offence but I 
                                              cannot do that on the case as 
                                              stated in its present form. If Mr.

                                              course to be taken he should have
