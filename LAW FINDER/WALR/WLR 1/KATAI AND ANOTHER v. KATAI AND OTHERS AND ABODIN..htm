													[EDITORIAL NOTE. It is an 
													established principle by Ga 
													native customary law that 
													the children of &quot;six-cloth&quot; 
													marriage, as distinct from 
													the children of other forms 
													of marriage among the Gas, 
													occupy a different position 
													as far as inheritance on the 
													death intestate of their 
													father is concerned. By the 
													Native customary laws of the 
													Gold Coast the self-acquired 
													property of a deceased Gold 
													Coast African dying 
													intestate becomes family 
													property. What the 
													constituents of the &quot;family&quot; 
													are differ among the various 
													tribes of the Gold Coast. 
													Among the Gas as among the 
													Akans the &quot;family&quot; in this 
													context is traced through 
													the maternal branch of the 
													deceased's family. While 
													children of other forms of 
													marriage among the Gas have 
													no interest in their 
													deceased father's estate 
													beyond the right to live in 
													their father's house quamdiu 
													se bene gesserint (i.e., 
													during good behaviour), the 
													children of a &quot;six-cloth&quot; 
													marriage have a share in 
													their deceased father's 
													estate. </font></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 12.7pt; margin-left: .2pt; margin-right: .2pt">
													<font face="Arial">There is 
													however no rule of Ga native 
													customary law which provides 
													what such share is or should 
													be; it is a matter for the 
													head of the family to 
													decide. The law on this 
													subject is exhaustively 
													dealt with in <i>Solomon and 
													Vanderpuye </i>v. <i>
													Botchway </i>(1943) 9 
													W.A.C.A. 127) the locus 
													classicus on the subject. 
													Since this case, however, 
													the West African Court of 
													Appeal has placed a novel 
													interpretation on what 
													constitutes the interest to 
													which these children are 
													entitled. This arose in a 
													case concerned with the same 
													estate as <i>Solomon and 
													Vanderpuye </i>v. <i>
													Botchway</i>(1943) 9 W.A.C.A. 
													127. The later case was <i>
													Vanderpuye </i>v. <i>
													Botchway, </i>W.A.C.A .. 
													March 8, 1951, unreported, 
													and the interpretation 
													contained in it has been 
													reported in TV <i>ellington
													</i>v. <i>Quartey Papafio 
													and A nothe?', </i>W.A.C.A. 
													April 4, 1952, unreported, 
													to which van Lare J. refers 
													in his judgment. In <i>
													Vanderpuye </i>v. <i>
													Botchway, </i>W.A.C.A. March 
													8, 1951, the West African 
													Court of Appeal held that 
													the interest of &quot; six-cloth&quot; 
													children in the share 
													allotted to them &quot;has been 
													held&quot; to amount to a means 
													of support only and does not 
													entitle the children to call 
													for a partition of the 
													estate, as family property 
													is &quot;indivisible.&quot; No 
													authority was however cited 
													by the West African Court of 
													Appeal in support of its 
													dictum &quot;it has been held&quot; 
													and the judgment of the 
													court has since been set 
													aside on appeal to the Privy 
													Council. The judgment of the 
													Privy Council (dated April 
													23, 1956) was not based on a 
													consideration of the merits 
													of the statement of the 
													principle of Native 
													customary law contained in 
													the judgment of the West 
													African Court of Appeal but 
													it is doubtful whether that 
													principle, as so stated, can 
													still be considered binding. 
													The further issue regarding 
													the liability of the head of 
													a family to account to 
													members of the family in 
													respect of family property 
													in his or her possession 
													does not appear to be 
													material to the decision in 
													this case. That the head of 
													a family is not accountable 
													to members of the family is, 
													of course, an accepted 
													principle of ,Native 
													customary law. But&quot; 
													six-cloth&quot; children, who do 
													not belong to
													<font color="#FF0000">pg153
													</font>their father's 
													family, have been treated 
													differently. They have been 
													held to be entitled to an 
													account from the head of the 
													family in respect of their 
													share of their father's 
													estate, and the decision in 
													this case regarding the 
													non-accountability of the 
													head of the family can only 
													be justified on the ground 
													that no share had at the 
													date of the issue of the 
													writ been allotted to the 
													children. It seems clear 
													that when such a share is 
													allotted to the children 
													they will be entitled to an 
													account from the head of the 
													family in respect of that 
													share as from the date of 
													their father's death.]

													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -19.2pt; margin-left: 53.75pt; margin-right: .5pt">
													<font face="Arial">(1) In 
													the case of intestacy the 
													self-acquired property of 
													the deceased vests 
													immediately on his death in 
													the family as family 
													property. </font></p>
													<p class="Style" style="margin-left: 34.3pt; margin-right: 1.0pt">
													<font face="Arial">(2) The 
													native customary law is that 
													only the children of a Ga 
													six-cloth marriage are 
													entitled under Ga custom to 
													a share of the self-acquired 
													property of their deceased 
													father. (3) That share has 
													been termed an interest but

													of support out of the 
													estate. </font></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -19.2pt; margin-left: 53.75pt; margin-right: .5pt">
													<font face="Arial">(4) The 
													exact share or interest 
													which the child gets is not 
													laid down. It depends upon 
													the decision of the head of 
													the family assisted by other 
													members of the family. If he 
													thinks he has been unjustly 
													treated, a child has the 
													right to say so. </font></p>

													<font face="Arial">(5) The 
													members of a family are 
													traced through the maternal 
													ancestor, and the family is 
													the unit for the purpose of 
													ownership of property. All 
													the members have a joint 
													interest in the family 
													property which is 
													indivisible. </font></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -19.2pt; margin-left: 53.75pt; margin-right: .5pt">
													<font face="Arial">(!)) 
													Being indivisible, there can 
													be no apportionment in the 
													sense of the alienation of a 
													particular part of the 
													estate to the children which 
													would have the effect of 
													severing the family 
													property, unless the parties 
													agree to that course.&quot;
													</font></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.85pt; margin-right: .05pt">
													<font face="Arial">I have no 
													evidence that this house was 
													ever allotted and given to 
													all the children of the late 
													Katai as alleged in the writ 
													of summons, nor is there any 
													satisfactory evidence in 
													support of the plaintiffs' 
													allegation as contained in 
													paragraph 4 of their 
													statement of claim. The 
													evidence of the first 
													plaintiff, and that of a man 
													called Robert Ayiku, himself 
													not a member of the family, 
													on this allegation are in 
													conflict and must be 
													rejected as unsatisfactory 
													and unimpressive. What has 
													emerged on the evidence as a 
													whole is that after the 
													death of Oyebah, and during 
													the headship of the present 
													head, the co-defendant, the 
													children of the late Katai, 
													labouring under the 
													erroneous impression of the 
													Ga Native customary law of 
													succession, assumed 
													exclusive ownership of their 
													late father's property. They 
													arranged between themselves 
													and assumed the management 
													and collection of the rents 
													accruing over the head of 
													the co-defendant. I find 
													that this agree­ment was 
													without the knowledge and 
													consent of the co-defendant, 
													the head of the family. Some 
													of the children were 
													appointed caretakers and an 
													account opened at the Post 
													Office. I am not satisfied 
													that the defendants or any 
													of them were or was lawfully 
													appointed caretaker in 
													respect of this property. 
													Such adverse claim, together 
													with the attempted dealing 
													with the family property by 
													the plaintiffs and their 
													other brothers and sisters 
													to the exclusion of other 
													members of their late 
													father's family, constitutes 
													a transgression according to 
													native customary law; in my 
													view the plaintiffs and the 
													other children concerned 
													render themselves liable to 
													forfeit their interest in 
													the family property.

													<font face="Arial">The 
													parties, that is to say the 
													plaintiffs and the original 
													defendants, are in pari 
													delicto, and as the cause of 
													action appears to arise ex 
													turpi causa or from a 
													transgression of the law, 
													the plaintiffs cannot be 
													assisted by the court. 
													Furthermore the plaintiffs 
													as children are not 
													competent to institute this 
													action in view of the 
													well-established and 
													recognized principle that 
													the head of the family alone 
													can sue and be sued as the 
													representative of the family 
													respecting claims on the 
													family possessions. It has 
													been many times laid down by 
													the courts that the head of 
													the family in whom the 
													property vests in trust for 
													the rest of the family is 
													the proper person to bring 
													actions with respect to the 
													family property. <i>(Laryea

													(3) at p. 125.) </font></p>

													<font face="Arial">Even if, 
													as it does appear on the 
													evidence, some members of 
													the family are collecting 
													rents from the family 
													property without accounting 
													for the same, it is for the 
													co-defendant, as head of the 
													family, to take an action 
													for account, and not the 
													plaintiffs, as in this 
													matter. This case is 
													distinguishable from <i>
													Nelson </i>v. <i>Nelson </i>
													(4), where a deceased person 
													before his death appointed, 
													by the death-bed disposition 
													(Simansiw), one of his sons 
													to look after the interest 
													of his brothers and sisters, 
													the appointment not 
													constituting appointment as 
													head of the family but 
													merely as a &quot;caretaker&quot; of 
													the family property, and as 
													such the son was held liable 
													to account to his brothers 
													and sisters for all the 
													proceeds of the family 
													property coming into his 
													hands. It is significant 
													that in that case the 
													property was in fact granted 
													or given by the deceased 
													father to his children; but 
													in this case the property 
													still remains vested in the 
													head of the family and was 
													not proved to have been 
													transferred or allotted to 
													the children. </font></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .2in; margin-left: 1.9pt; margin-right: 1.9pt">
													<font face="Arial">I am 
													disposed to think that upon 
													the head of the family being 
													joined as a co;defendant in 
													the case the plaintiffs 
													should have dropped their 
													action; but they did not. 
													Their statement of claim was 
													filed as against the 
													co-defendant as well 
													claiming accounts and for an 
													Order against her to pay to 
													the plaintiffs what may be 
													found due to them. On the 
													authorities the head of a 
													family is not liable to 
													account; that being so the 
													plaintiffs' action, which 
													has been fought to this 
													bitter end, is in my view 
													misconceived. In J. <i>A. 
													Pappoe </i>v. <i>Tetteh 
													Kweku (5), </i>the law has 
													been laid down as follows:-

													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 15.1pt; margin-left: 23.75pt">
													<font face="Arial">&quot; The 
													appellant does not attempt 
													to assert that Ga law 
													imposes on the head of the 
													family an obligation to 
													account which is unknown to 
													Fanti law, but he argues 
													that English law applies. In 
													my opinion the learned Chief 
													Justice was justified in 
													finding that native law 
													applies, and that it is a 
													general principle of native 
													law that the personal 
													property of a deceased head 
													of a family passes to his 
													successor (subject to 
													certain obligations to 
													support the other members of 
													the family), and that an 
													action of accounting is 
													unknown to native law. It 
													may be asked what remedy a 
													member of a family has if 
													the head refuses to give him 
													anything. The answer would 
													appear to be that although, 
													in the <font color="#FF0000">
													pg 157 </font>words of 
													Sarbah, he cannot ' claim an 
													account from the head of the 
													family or call for an 
													appropriation to himself of 
													any special portion of the 
													family estate, or income 
													therefrom arising,' yet he 
													has a certain claim upon the 
													head of the family for 
													support-the extent of 
													support varying with the 
													family means-and I assume 
													that he could enforce this 
													by action.</font></div>

												to the plaintiffs because &quot;the
