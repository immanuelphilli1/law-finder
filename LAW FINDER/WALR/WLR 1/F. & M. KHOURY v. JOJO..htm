												Letters of administration in the 
												estate of S. who died intestate 
												in Accra, were granted to his 
												sister's husband, one Elias 
												Chahin. He, finding it unlikely 
												that the estate would be 
												solvent, and by arrangement with 
												the creditors, conveyed all the 
												trust property to three 
												trustees, of whom he was one, 
												upon trusts for the sale and 
												conversion of the estate into 
												cash and for payments to be made 
												therefrom according to a stated 
												order of priorities. The 
												plaintiffs were creditors of the 
												estate; the defendant one of the 
												trustees, appointed as 
												&quot;treasurer&quot; by the other&nbsp;
												<font color="#FF0000">pg103
												</font>two. Among the assets of 
												the estate were certain personal 
												effects of value and, so it 
												appeared, a house. The personal 
												effects were delivered to the 
												defendant and subsequently' were 
												found to be missing. The 
												explanation of their loss given 
												by the defendant was that they 
												had been stolen from a safe in 
												his store during the period of 
												rioting and civil commotion in 
												Accra. It appeared that the 
												defendant had anticipated loss 
												and damage to property before 
												the rioting occurred, for he had 
												amended an insurance policy on 
												his own goods to cover loss 
												caused by civil commotion. He 
												had not, however, done anything 
												to insure the personal effects, 
												nor had he removed them to a 
												place of greater safety. As 
												regards the house, this was 
												purchased by the defendant at a 
												public auction in September, 
												1948, for the figure of £2,500, 
												which sum appeared as an asset 
												of the estate. Prior to the 
												auction the defendant had, from 
												the estate, redeemed the 
												property from a mortgage with 
												which the deceased had 
												incumbered it. The sum that had 
												been secured by the mortgage was 
												greater than that realized by 
												the unincumbered auction of the 
												property. The defendant claimed 
												that he had arranged the auction 
												at the request of, and had 
												purchased the property from a 
												sister of the deceased, one 
												Salime Chahin, to whom it had 
												been conveyed by the deceased in 
												June, 1946. The defendant did 
												not produce the conveyance.

												<font face="Arial">APPEAL from

												given in the Divisional Court, 
												Accra, on January 19, 1954. The 
												plaintiff claimed an account of 
												the assets of the estate that 
												had come into the hands of the 
												defen­dant and an order for 
												distribution of such amounts as 
												should be shown by the account 
												to be properly distributable. 
												The Divisional Court ordered the 
												account and as a result gave 
												judgment for the plaintiffs for 
												£4,130 Os. 6d. The court held, 
												however, that the defendant had 
												not been demonstrated to be 
												negligent as regards the 
												personal effects and was 
												therefore not accountable for 
												their loss, and that as the 
												conduct of the auction sale had

													kept the trinkets in his 
													safe at a time when to his 
													own knowledge there was such 
													imminent threat of civil 
													commotion and looting, on 
													account of which he had 
													taken the precaution to 
													amend his insurance policy 
													for goods in the store to 
													cover that risk, cannot be 
													believed, and that the rule 
													in <i>Coggs </i>v. <i>
													Bernard </i>(1) which the 
													court relied on, did not 
													apply to the degree of 
													negligence which has been 
													established by evidence in 
													the case. As regards the 
													house, that it is 
													unnecessary for the 
													principal on whose behalf an 
													agent or trustee is acting 
													to file a bill to set aside 
													a wrongful or illegal 
													purchase made by such agent 
													or trustee before claiming 
													accounts or any other 
													relief, and that it is wrong 
													for the court to declare as 
													a principle of law that the 
													alleged purchase by the 
													defendant is only voidable 
													and not absolutely 
													prohibited. </font></p>

													<font face="Arial">The 
													defendant admits that the 
													trinkets had been in his 
													possession as trustee, but 
													says they were contained in 
													a box which he kept in a 
													safe in his store, and 
													during the Accra riots 
													persons unknown broke into 
													the stores and stole them 
													together with other goods in 
													the store. He further admits 
													that twenty days before the 
													riots he had reason to 
													believe that there would be 
													riots and looting and 
													consequently he amended an 
													insurance policy for the 
													goods to cover civil 
													commotion and looting. 
													However, he neither insured 
													the trinkets nor deposited 
													them in the bank because he 
													did not anticipate that if 
													rioters broke into the store 
													they would open the safe and 
													steal its contents. </font>

													<font face="Arial">As 
													regards the house purchased 
													by the defendant he contends 
													that he bought it at a 
													public auction and is only 
													liable to account for the 
													price he paid for it. In <i>
													Hatch </i>v. <i>Hatch </i>
													(2) the Lord Chancellor 
													(Eldon) said:- </font></p>

													<font face="Arial">&quot;This 
													case proves the wisdom of 
													the court in saying, it is 
													almost impossible in the 
													course of the connection of 
													guardian and ward, attorney 
													and client <i>(Gibson </i>v.
													<i>Jeyes, </i>6 Ve. 267), 
													trustee and cestui que 
													trust, that a transaction 
													shall stand, purporting to 
													be bounty for the execution 
													of antecedent duty. (See <i>
													Coles </i>v. <i>Trecothick,
													</i>9 Yes. 234, and the 
													references in the note, p. 
													240.) There may not be a 
													more moral act, one that 
													would do more credit to a 
													young man beginning the 
													world, or afford a better 
													omen for the future, than 
													if, a trustee having done 
													his duty, the cestui que 
													trust, taking it into his 
													fair, serious, and 
													well-informed,
													<font color="#FF0000">pg106

													<font face="Arial">There are

													innocent the purchaser may 
													be in a given case. The 
													cestui que trust is not 
													bound to prove, nor is the 
													court bound to decide, that 
													the trustee has made a 
													bargain advantageous to 
													himself. The fact may be so 
													and yet the party not have 
													it in his power distinctly 
													and clearly to show it. It 
													is to guard against such 
													uncertainty and hazard of 
													abuse and to remove the 
													trustee from temptation that 
													the rule does and will 
													permit the cestui que trust 
													to come at his option, and 
													without showing essential 
													injury, to insist on another 
													sale or to compel the 
													trustee to reconvey the 
													property to the estate on 
													repayment of the purchase

													<font face="Arial">In this 
													case there is undisputed 
													evidence on record which 
													proves that the defendant 
													acting on behalf of himself 
													and of his co-trustees and 
													the administrator paid from 
													the estate the sum of £2,630 
													16s. 2d. and' other sums to 
													Barclays Bank to redeem the 
													property which the deceased 
													in his lifetime had 
													mortgaged to the bank. 
													Shortly after this, and 
													while the trust had not been 
													dissolved, the defendant 
													purports to have bought the 
													same property for £2,500 at 
													a public auction alleged to 
													be at the instance of the 
													sister of the deceased, who 
													is the wife of the 
													administrator. In the notice

													June 1946.&quot; </font></p>
													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 14.85pt; margin-left: .2pt; margin-right: 1.0pt">
													<font face="Arial">It will 
													be observed that the same 
													property which the defendant 
													as trustee redeemed with 
													trust money of the sum of 
													not less than £2,500, he 
													purports to have bought at a 
													public auction at the 
													instance of the sister of 
													the deceased in September 
													1948, she holding it under 
													an alleged deed of 
													conveyance dated June 27, 
													1946, i.e., more than one 
													year before the death of the 
													late Sassine Elias Sassine 
													of whose estate defendant is 
													a trustee. The said document 
													has not been produced in 
													evidence, nor is there any 
													proof on record showing how 
													the deceased's sister became 
													the owner of the property. 
													Although it was sold as 
													alleged by the sister, the 
													purchase-money, a sum of 
													£2,466 alleged to be subject 
													to deduction of £33 19s. by 
													the auctioneer, is shown in 
													the accounts as money 
													realised from the sale of 
													trust <font color="#FF0000">
													pg 107 </font>property. In 
													these circumstances it is 
													difficult for the defendant 
													to contend that he has acted 
													honestly in the transaction, 
													and indeed whether any 
													right, title and interest of 
													the estate has passed to 
													defendant or anyone else.

													<font face="Arial">Shortly 
													after the alleged sale, the 
													defendant leased the 
													property to a tenant for 
													£300 per annum, now 
													increased to £500. In my 
													view the whole transaction 
													is tainted with fraud such 
													as would make the defendant 
													liable not only to reconvey 
													the property to the estate, 
													if indeed it was ever 
													conveyed by anyone to the 
													defendants, but also to 
													account for the rents and 
													other profits since 
													September, 1948. </font></p>

													<font face="Arial">In regard 
													to the trinkets, there is no 
													other evidence on record 
													apart from the statement of 
													the defendant that they were 
													in fact kept in his safe in 
													the store, or, even if they 
													were kept in the safe at any 
													time, that he left them in 
													that safe when to his own 
													knowledge there was an 
													imminent threat of civil 
													commotion and looting, on 
													account of which he had 
													taken the precaution to 
													amend his insurance policy 
													to cover' the same risk with 
													respect to his own goods in 
													the same store. In these 
													circumstances, assuming the 
													trinkets were in the safe as 
													alleged there could hardly 
													be any more glaring evidence 
													of gross negligence on the

													make him liable for the

													record as the trial judge 
													had with respect to gross 
													negligence, and it is my

													clearly proved gross

													that he had unfortunately 
													put it with a larger sum of 
													money of his own into his 
													cash box, which was kept in 
													his taproom; that the 
													taproom had a bar in it and 
													was open on a Sunday, but 
													the rest of the house, which 
													was inhabited, was not open 
													on Sunday, and that the 
													cash-box with his own money 
													and the plaintiff's had been

													judge left it to the jury 
													whether the defendant was 
													guilty of gross negligence; 
													and he told them that the 
													loss of the defendant's own 
													money did not necessarily 
													prove reasonable care. The 
													jury having found for the
