												<font face="Arial">AMES Ag.J.A. 
												This appeal raises a question of 
												interpretation 0 Rule 10 of the 
												Native Courts (Southern Section 
												of Togoland unde British 
												Mandate) Procedure Regulations, 
												1949, which reads:- </font></p>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; 10. If the plaintiff or 
												complainant does not appear when 
												th cause is called on the return 
												day, the Native Court, unless 
												the~ is some good reason for 
												keeping it on the list (and in 
												that</span><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">&nbsp;pg123
												</font><font face="Arial">reason 
												shall be recorded and the 
												hearing day fixed), shall strike 
												the cause out.&quot; </font>
												<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												The question is this. A suit is 
												brought by summons in a Native 
												Court and an application is 
												filed before the return day of 
												the summons by the defendant by 
												motion on notice for a ruling 
												that the matter is res judicata 
												by reason of a previous decision 
												of the same court. Both the suit 
												and the application come before 
												the court after the return date 
												of the summons (presumably there 
												were adjournments) and the court 
												hears the defendant's 
												application and upholds the 
												submission of res judicata 
												whereupon the plaintiff appeals 
												to the Native Court of Appeal. 
												This appellate court allows the 
												appeal and sends the suit back 
												to the lower court for the suit 
												to be heard and determined 
												according to pro­cedure set out 
												in Regulations 15, <b>17 </b>and 
												18. The suit consequently comes 
												again before the lower court, 
												and a day is appointed for the 
												hearing. In these circumstances 
												is this last-mentioned day a &quot; 
												return day&quot; within the meaning 
												of Rule 1O? </font></p>
												<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												That was the course of events 
												which had happened here. There 
												were two plaintiffs and five 
												defendants; the plaintiffs sued 
												for them­selves and on behalf of 
												their family, the Magadagbe 
												family, which had appointed them 
												their representatives for the 
												purpose. The Native Court of 
												Appeal seems to have thought 
												(and perhaps correctly) that the 
												lower court should not have 
												heard, as they did, the 
												application by motion made by 
												two of the defendants, leaving 
												the suit on the shelf, so to 
												speak, but should have followed 
												strictly the procedure in Rules 
												15, 17<b> </b>and 18, by calling 
												the suit and by asking the 
												defendants their answer and then 
												hearing evidence about the plea 
												of res judicata. </font></p>
												<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												On the second occasion they did 
												do so, but not immediately. The 
												parties were notified to appear 
												on May 12, when the first 
												plaintiff appeared but not the 
												second, and then again on August 
												4, when the second plaintiff 
												appeared but not the first, and 
												then again on August 17, when 
												neither of them appeared. The 
												court then heard the merits of 
												the defendants' plea of res 
												judicata and upheld it again. 
												(The plea was founded on a 1937 
												decision of the same court, 
												which was reversed on appeal to 
												the Native Court of Appeal and 
												restored on a further appeal to 
												the Court of the Provincial 
												Commissioner.) </font></p>
												<p><font face="Arial">The 
												plaintiffs did not appeal 
												against this second ruling, 
												given on August 17, 1950, but on 
												September 1, 1950, they issued 
												another summons in the Native 
												Court, which was transferred to 
												the Land Court by an order dated 
												September 5, 1951. When the suit 
												came on for hearing in the ,Land 
												Court, the same plea of res 
												judicata was made and upheld in 
												a decision given on June 27, 
												1952, against which the 
												plaintiffs have made this 
												appeal. </font></p>
												<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												The only argument that Mr. 
												Bossman has been able to make on 
												behalf of the plaintiffs is that 
												after the case went back to the 
												Native Court (after the appeal) 
												the date fixed for hearing was a 
												&quot; return day&quot; within the meaning 
												of Rule 10, and that as neither 
												plaintiff was
												<font color="#FF0000">pg 125
												</font>might lie within the area 
												controlled by the Asamankese 
												Stool, nevertheless the act of 
												selling it constituted a 
												sufficient assertion of 
												ownership by the Akanteng Stool 
												to enable them to convey a good 
												title to a purchaser. They 
												claimed further that in any case 
												the consent of the Akyem Abuakwa 
												Stool was sufficient to validate 
												the conveyance to the 
												plaintiffs' predecessor. </font>
