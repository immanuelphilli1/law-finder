													inconsistent with the 
													appellant's defence that the

													Explanations were, however, 
													given in evidence by both 
													parties before the learned 
													trial judge who found in 
													favour of the respondents. I 
													am unable to say that he was 
													wrong in accepting, as he

													<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .2in; margin-left: .05in; margin-right: 4.85pt">
													<font face="Arial">It was,

												It is not merely a matter of 
												pleading that is involved in the 
												view I have taken, but also one 
												of principle. Counsel for the 
												respondents admitted that before 
												the judge could have made an 
												order for possession on the 
												ground that arrears of rent were 
												due, he would have had to 
												exercise his discretion as to 
												whether such an order was 
												justified. If the respondents 
												had applied for leave to amend 
												their pleadings so as to ask for 
												possession on the ground that 
												arrears of rent were due, the 
												appellant, if leave had been 
												granted, could have abandoned 
												his defence that the sum of £30 
												only per month was payable by 
												him as rent, have paid the full 
												claim of the respondents into 
												court and have invited the judge 
												to take what he had done into 
												consideration in deciding 
												whether the respondents' claim 
												for recovery of possession 
												should be granted. Again, if the 
												appellant was aware that the 
												judge had it in mind to make an 
												order for possession, not on the 
												ground on which the respon­dents 
												had asked that it should be 
												made, but on the ground (as it 
												is assumed for the purpose of 
												argument) that he adopted for 
												making the order, his counsel 
												would undoubtedly have asked 
												him, in the exercise of his 
												discretion, to take into account 
												that the appellant had been 
												required to pay £60 per month 
												for two stores the rental of 
												which had been fixed under 
												section 5 of .the Rent Control 
												Ordinance, 1952, at £16 15s. 
												with effect from April 1, 1953, 
												about two months after the suit 
												had been filed (Exhibit 2). It 
												is this, I have little doubt, 
												that led the respondents 
												consciously and advisedly not to 
												ask for possession on the ground 
												that what appears to be an 
												exorbitant rent had not been 
												paid in full: for such a prayer 
												based on that ground, as it must 
												have been foreseen, would have 
												afforded scope for the exercise 
												of judicial discretion in favour 
												of the appellant. </font></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 13.9pt; margin-left: 4.05pt; margin-right: .2pt">
												<font face="Arial">I have dealt 
												with the submissions of counsel 
												for the respondents on the basis 
												of the assumption which he made. 
												But, as I have said elsewhere, 
												it is an assumption I am unable 
												to accept. From a perusal of the 
												whole record I am only prepared 
												to assume that the judge made 
												the order he did on the ground 
												on which he was invited to make 
												the order, and there is not an 
												iota of evidence to justify the 
												order on that ground. </font>

												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 13.9pt; margin-left: 4.05pt; margin-right: .2pt">
