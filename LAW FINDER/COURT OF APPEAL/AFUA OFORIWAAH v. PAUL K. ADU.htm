						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">MRS. AKOTO-BAMFO, J.A.:
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is an appeal and a 
						cross appeal filed against the decision of the Circuit 
						Court dated the 8th of November 1999.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In order to appreciate 
						the issues raised, I find it necessary to give a brief 
						back ground to the events culminating into the appeals 
						filed by the respective parties.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Afua Oforiwaa was 
						married to Paul Adu under custom sometime in 1965; they 
						cohabited in Kumasi and subsequently at Accra.&nbsp; The 
						union was blessed with seven (7) children.&nbsp; In the 
						course of time the husband left the shores of Ghana to 
						seek greener pastures in Britain.&nbsp; He arranged for the 
						wife to join him later. While there Afua worked both as 
						a cleaner and a seamstress while Paul worked with a 
						motor firm.&nbsp; Being an illiterate she gave all her 
						earnings to the husband who operated a joint account 
						opened by them.&nbsp; It appears that all their earnings were 
						paid into this account and expenses taken therefrom.&nbsp; 
						Out of the joint savings they purchased a house and some 
						household chattels.&nbsp; When they decided to return to 
						Ghana, they sold the house; used part of the proceeds in 
						establishing various businesses firstly clinker, rice 
						and sugar imports and secondly as dealers in 2nd hand 
						goods.&nbsp; It is evident that the peace and quiet of their 
						matrimonial home was disturbed with advent of one Ama 
						Serwaa into their lives; the husband had an extramarital 
						affair with Ama Serwaa, had a child with her and she 
						later moved to live closely to the matrimonial home.&nbsp; 
						This was to be the beginning of the end of this 
						otherwise reasonably happy marriage&#8212;for the couple till 
						then operated businesses together and did many things in 
						common.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">When the wife felt she 
						could no longer stand the heat, as it were, she 
						petitioned for divorce and prayed for a number of 
						ancillary reliefs.&nbsp; The husband in his answer claimed 
						that the marriage had been dissolved as far back as 
						1990, and that he had allowed the wife into his home 
						because she was pregnant and custom forbade a man 
						divorcing a wife in that condition.&nbsp; The Court took 
						evidence and found that no such dissolution had taken 
						place and therefore that the marriage was subsisting.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Court therefore 
						took evidence on the reliefs claimed by the wife among 
						which were for an order for a dissolution of the 
						marriage, custody of the minor children and a half share 
						of their jointly acquired matrimonial home described as 
						identification No. D40 Abeka Lapaz and a half share of 
						all the household chattels.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">For the petitioner this 
						ground was filed;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">That the Honourable 
						Judge misdirected himself and also made an error in 
						arriving at the conclusion that the petitioner was 
						entitled to 1/3 share of the matrimonial home No. D40 
						Abeka Lapaz as well as his decision on the vehicle named 
						in the petition.&nbsp; Particulars of the misdirection were 
						set out as follows;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1) The Hon. Judge 
						disregarded Article 22(3) of the 1992 Constitution on 
						the distribution of properties acquired during marriage.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) The Hon. Judge 
						disregarded the legal implications of the disability of 
						the petitioner &#8211; an illiterate to be able to give 
						correct account of names and for work done in Britain.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The respondent 
						cross-appealed in these terms;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">That the Hon. Judge&#8217;s 
						order or decision that 1/3 share of house no. D40 Abeka 
						Lapaz be given to the petitioner was not supported by 
						the evidence and has occasioned, for the cross appellant 
						substantial miscarriage of justice.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Before considering the 
						issues raised in this appeal I wish to comment briefly 
						on the manner the grounds of appeal for the appellant 
						were formulated.&nbsp; Under C19 rules 8(2) a and 5 the 
						appellant is required to set out and under distinct 
						heads the grounds upon which the appellant intends to 
						rely at the hearing.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A look at the notice 
						filed by the appellant shows that only one ground of 
						appeal was filed, namely that the decision on the 
						matrimonial home was erroneous, it is evident however 
						that in giving the particulars as provided for under 
						rule 8(4) thereof learned counsel did not confine 
						herself to the alleged misdirection in relation to the 
						matrimonial home but did stray into other areas like 
						custody and maintenance of the children of the marriage 
						which were not subject of the appeal.&nbsp; This state of 
						affairs cannot be described as satisfactory.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In her submissions, 
						learned counsel argued that in so far as the couple did 
						not mention any properties acquired before the marriage 
						but that all the properties were acquired when they 
						either worked in London or in Accra where they jointly 
						established businesses with their savings from their 
						joint savings the Court erred in awarding the appellant 
						1/3 share of the matrimonial home.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It must be pointed out 
						that learned counsel for the cross appellant failed to 
						file written submissions in respect of the cross 
						appellant. The cross appeal is therefore struck out.
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The parties started 
						their married life in Kumasi, subsequently the husband 
						moved to London to be joined by the wife, they both 
						lived and worked there.&nbsp; Indeed in the words of the 
						husband &#8220;Petitioner joined me in London and worked in 
						1982; before the petitioner came I was working with Ford 
						Motors. About a month after the petitioner joined me I 
						was declared redundant and was paid off. I was paid ten 
						pounds&#8230;&#8230;... Petitioner was then working.&nbsp; I put her in a 
						sewing class. After she had completed I bought for her a 
						machine and got jobs for her.&nbsp; She was sewing car 
						cushions covers. After sewing I will follow and send 
						them back to where I collected the materials.&nbsp; I 
						received payment on her behalf.&nbsp; I paid the cheques into 
						our joint account.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is the petitioner&#8217;s 
						story that she was working at many different jobs, 
						sewing and doing some cleaning jobs at the same time. 
						According to her she was making £300 monthly.&nbsp; Even 
						though the respondent denied that the petitioner was 
						earning that much it is clear from his testimony that 
						the petitioner was giving all her earnings to him; that 
						they operated a joint account and that out of the joint 
						savings they purchased some household chattels and paid 
						their bills. Indeed they bought a house from that 
						account. When they subsequently decided to return to 
						Ghana they sold that house and brought the proceeds 
						down. There is abundant evidence that on their return 
						they jointly established firstly a business in imports 
						of clinker, milk &amp; sugar and dealt in 2nd hand goods; 
						there is a common strand; they operated these businesses 
						jointly and these ventures were financed from the common 
						fund whose genesis lay in the proceeds realized from the 
						sale of the London property.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">With regard to the 
						subject of the appeal i.e the matrimonial home; even 
						though the petitioner averred that the land was bought 
						out of their joint savings, the respondent contended 
						that it was a gift from one Orgle and indeed tendered in 
						evidence exhibit 7 the Deed of gift.&nbsp; According to 
						exhibit 7 the parties were Ernest Orgle the donor and 
						Paul Adu the donee.&nbsp; The deed was executed on 20th 
						January 1990 and stamped in 1997. It is of significance 
						that the marriage was subsisting at the time and more 
						importantly that they were jointly operating businesses 
						financed from the common fund.&nbsp; It was in September that 
						year that they appeared before a panel constituted by 
						members of both families to patch up their differences.&nbsp; 
						On the face it, one can safely argue that since it was 
						clear as per exhibit 7 that the respondent was the donee 
						the petitioner&#8217;s evidence on the issue was not worthy of 
						any credit; that the petitioner was illiterate and the 
						respondent therefore conducted all transactions on 
						behalf of the family is not in doubt; indeed it was 
						clearly established in evidence that purchases made 
						jointly by them were put in name of the respondent at 
						all material times.&nbsp; In the light of this can it be said 
						that exhibit 7 is conclusive? I think not.&nbsp; Be that as 
						it may the respondent testified that between 1990 &amp; 92, 
						he travelled to the United States of America, brought in 
						some goods and used the proceeds in financing in the 
						construction of the house. Between 1991/92 the parties 
						were married they indeed lived in a house they had 
						jointly rented at Tesano, as at the time husband left 
						for the United States of America they were in business 
						together. The learned Judge therefore rightly found that 
						as at 1990 there was a common fund out of which the 
						respondent&#8217;s trips were financed. Having regard to the 
						fact that the respondent travelled out of the 
						jurisdiction and left the care of children to the 
						petitioner in the matrimonial home, the learned judge 
						fell into an error when he awarded 1/3 share of the 
						value thereof to the petitioner.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It must be noted that 
						even though the fact that a wife who has faithfully 
						served a husband during marriage does not by itself 
						entitle her to a share in the property acquired it is 
						however settled that where both parties contributed 
						towards the acquisition of the property, then each must 
						have a share in it. Abebreseh v Kaah &amp; Ors. 1976 2 GLR 
						46 and Domfe v. Adu 1984-86 GLRD 77.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the latter 
						case the Court held inter alia that the legal principles 
						applicable were those of English law of Trust and on the 
						basis of legal authorities, since the respondent also 
						participated actively in the running of the business she 
						was therefore entitled to an equal share of the profits 
						and other benefits flowing directly therefrom.&nbsp; If 
						indeed as contended by the husband the marriage had been 
						dissolved at the time they lived in the rented premises 
						and he had solely financed the construction of the Abeka 
						property, he would not have given the petitioner access 
						thereto; that he moved the petitioner into the Abeka 
						property and left her there to look after the children 
						of the marriage supports the view it was intended that 
						the property be family asset to which both have equal 
						shares.</span></p>
