						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The question which 
						arises for determination in the instant appeal in my 
						view is within a narrow compass; namely whether the 
						award of damages by the learned trial judge was right in 
						the circumstances of the case? In his delivery, the 
						subject matter of these proceedings, the trial judge 
						awarded ¢20,000,000.00 being general and special damages 
						inclusive of ¢7,127,000.00 which he categorised as 
						special damages. In particular, at page 120 of the 
						record of proceedings, the trial judge as regards the 
						damages due to the plaintiff from June - December 1988 
						arrived at ¢7,200,000.00 out of which he deducted 
						¢73,000.00 being the salary for the operator over the 
						period and was thus left with ¢7,127,000.00. In my view, 
						the award under this head covering the period in respect 
						of which it was computed cannot be faulted since having 
						regard to the contract of hire between the parties, 
						there was a pre-determined liability of the hirer until 
						the equipment which it had hired from the plaintiff was 
						returned. Such a head of claim in my view sounded more 
						in liquidated damages which refers to what the liability 
						of a party to a contract is in the event of a default or 
						upon the occurrence of an event such as the effluxion of 
						time. In those cases, clearly at the date of the 
						concluded contract, the parties would have provided a 
						genuine pre-estimate of the loss which is to be paid and 
						by a mere reference to the agreement the court is 
						enabled to arrive at the figure taking into account the 
						number of days as was the case in the instant appeal in 
						respect of the liability of the hirer to the owner under 
						the contract of hire. Relating this to the facts which 
						provoked the action, herein, I think that the finding of 
						the trial judge that the cost of hire was ¢40,000.00 a 
						day which is contained in Exhibit &#8216;B&#8217;, the agreement of 
						hire is an instance of the agreement of the parties on 
						what the liability of the hirer should&nbsp; be and in such a 
						situation, the owner&#8217;s entitlement is one in the nature 
						of liquidated damages of Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th 
						Edition Vol.12 para.1116 @ 419.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I proceed further to 
						say that it is important to bear in mind that in Exhibit 
						&#8216;B&#8217;, the parties had provided that until the equipment 
						was returned, the same was under the agreement of hire. 
						In particular, in the closing paragraph of Exhibit &#8216;B&#8217; 
						appearing immediately above the signature of the parties 
						to the agreement it is provided thus: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The date of 
						commencement shall be construed as the date the plant 
						leaves its existing location for delivery to the hirer. 
						The date of termination shall be the date it is returned 
						to the owner&#8217;s department or an equivalent location as 
						determined by the owner.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The above provision 
						though not under the specific heading &#8220;Termination of 
						Agreement&#8221; overrides that which appears under the 
						heading &#8220;Termination of Agreement&#8221; on the ground that 
						the specific provisions on termination refer only to 
						acts, the default of which by the hirer may have the 
						effect of bringing the contractual relationship between 
						them to an end and does not cater for the events 
						specifically provided in the paragraph referred to which 
						is contained in Exhibit &#8216;B&#8217;, the agreement which governs 
						the relationship between the parties. In my view, the 
						said events are one of fact which upon their occurrence 
						are decisive of either the commencement of the hire 
						agreement or its termination namely the delivery of the 
						equipment to the hirer&#8217;s site and the subsequent 
						delivery of the same to the owner. To place the meaning 
						contended by learned counsel for the appellant as to 
						what constitutes termination is in my view one which 
						would deny the owner of the protection to which it is 
						entitled under such agreements mainly the obligation of 
						the hirer to surrender possession to the owner upon the 
						termination of the agreement of hire. I am of the 
						thinking further that until the plant was returned, the 
						contract of hire was deemed not to be at an end and on 
						this ground, the hirer is liable to the owner at the 
						rate provided for in Exhibit &#8216;B&#8217;. I therefore hold that 
						the finding of the learned trial judge and his 
						consequential computation of the damages from June - 
						December 1988 were rightly done and cannot be impeached 
						in these proceedings.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It being so, I next 
						turn to consider the portion of the award which is in 
						excess of the ¢7,127,000.00. I commence with the 
						statement that since the hirer, the Respondent, had the 
						equipment under a contract evidenced by Exhibit &#8216;B&#8217; 
						which made provision for the cost of hire which the 
						learned trial judge accepted as ¢40,000.00 per day, the 
						hirer was obliged by his solemn contractual undertaking 
						borne out by its signature to pay the said amount for 
						each day that the equipment was in its possession. This 
						sort of liability as earlier on said is in the nature of 
						liquidated damages which falls under what is described 
						as special damages. I am of the view that since there 
						was an agreement at the date of the contract by way of 
						an estimate in the nature of the cost of hire per day, 
						after the passage of each day, the owner&#8217;s entitlement 
						was in the nature of actual loss of earnings suffered 
						once the hirer - the Respondent, did not pay up the 
						agreed cost of hire to it. Therefore, over a period such 
						as was the case which resulted in the writ of summons 
						herein being issued, the owner's damages was in the 
						nature of past-earnings, lost and or suffered and not 
						one which fell to it in the nature of general damages. 
						On this point, I wish to refer to the statement of Bowen 
						LJ. in Radcliffe vrs: Evans (1892) 2 QB 524 @ 528 as 
						follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Lest we should be 
						led astray in such a matter by mere words, it is 
						desirable to recollect that the term &#8220;special damages&#8221; 
						which is found for centuries in&nbsp;&nbsp; the books is not 
						always used with reference to similar subject matter nor 
						in the same context. At times, (both in the law of tort 
						and of contract) it is employed to denote that damage, 
						arising out of the special circumstances of the case 
						which if properly pleaded may be superadded to the 
						general damage which the law presumes in every breach of 
						contract and every infringement of an absolute 
						right&#8230;..In all such cases, the law presumes that some 
						damage will flow from the ordinary course of things from 
						the mere invasion of the plaintiff's right, and calls it 
						general damage. Special damage in this context means the 
						particular damage (beyond the general damage) which 
						results from the particular circumstances of the case, 
						and of the plaintiff's claim to be compensated for which 
						he ought to give warning in his pleadings in order that 
						there may be no surprise at the trial. But where no 
						actual positive right (apart from the damage none) has 
						been disturbed, it is the damage done that is the wrong; 
						and the expression &#8220;special damage&#8221; when used of this 
						damage denotes the actual and temporal loss which has in 
						fact occurred. Such damage is called variously in old 
						authorities &#8220;express loss&#8221;, &#8220;particular 
						damage&#8221;&#8230;..&#8221;damage in fact&#8221;, &#8220;special or particular cause 
						of loss&#8221; See also Halsbury's Laws of England 4th Edition 
						Vol.12 para..1113 @ 416.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Applying the above 
						statement which I accept as a correct exposition of the 
						law, I am of the opinion that the period commencing from 
						1/2/88 to 30/5/88 also was one in the nature of 
						liquidated damage, a damage which having regard to the 
						facts of this case, falls under the clarification 
						&#8220;special damage&#8221;. Therefore, the Respondent's 
						entitlement is reached by multiplying the cost of hire 
						by the number of days. By a simple arithmetical 
						calculation the total number of days comes to 131 which 
						is made up as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1) 21/1/88&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						31/1/38&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; 10 days</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) 1/2/88&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						29/2/88&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; 29&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(3) 1/3/88&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						31/3/88&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; 31&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(4) 1/4/88&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						30/4/88&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; 30&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(5) 1/5/88&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						30/5/88&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; 30&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The said period in 
						terms of weeks comes to eighteen weeks and five days 
						which means that Sundays be deducted from the period 
						they representing non-working days. Making allowance for 
						the said eighteen days, one is left with 113 days out of 
						which I make allowance for imponderables which I allow 
						at five days leaving me with 108 days. Multiplying this 
						¢40,000.00 the owner&#8217;s entitlement comes to 
						¢4,320,000.00 for the said period. The plaintiff 
						respondent total award for the cost of hire thus comes 
						to:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp; ¢4,320.000.00.&nbsp; and</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7,127,000.00</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">¢11,457,000.00</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I wish to observe that 
						beyond this actual loss which was proved there is no 
						evidence which might justify the award of general 
						damages. I also wish to say that the learned trial judge 
						did not in his judgment, the subject matter of this 
						appeal refer to any other act in the nature of a wrong 
						on which he based the award described as general 
						damages. It being so, I proceed to set aside the award 
						of ¢20 million described as general and special damages 
						and in place thereof substitute damages in the nature of 
						cost of hire and or special damages in the sum of 
						¢11,457.000.00 representing the Plaintiff-Respondent&#8217;s 
						entitlement under the agreement of hire&#8212;Exhibit &#8216;B&#8217;. 
						Since the said amount was wrongfully withheld from the 
						owner&#8212;the plaintiff respondent, I think that the same 
						should attract interest. See (1) Denning MR. in 
						Harbutt&#8217;s Plastiscine vrs: Wayne Tank Ltd. (1970) 1 All 
						ER 225 @ 236. (2) Jeffard vrs: Gee (1970) 1 All ER 1202 
						@ 1205. In the last of these cases Denning MR observed 
						approving Herschell LJ in London Chatham &amp; Dover Rly. 
						Co. vrs: South Eastern Rly Co. (1893) AC 429 @ 439 as 
						follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;....I think that when 
						money is owing from one party to another and the other 
						is driven to have recourse to legal proceedings in order 
						to recover the amount due to him, the party who is 
						wrongfully withholding the money from the other ought 
						not in justice to benefit by having that money in his 
						possession and enjoying the use of it, when the money 
						ought to be in the possession of the other party who is 
						entitled to its use. Therefore if I could see my way to 
						do so, I should certainly be disposed to give the 
						appellant or anybody in a similar position interest upon 
						the amount withheld from the time of action brought at 
						all events.&#8221; See also LI 1295&#8212;Court's (Award of 
						Interest) Instrument 1984 which makes the award
