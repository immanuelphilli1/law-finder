						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This case of the 
						appellant who was the plaintiff at the trial court was 
						that he was one of ten Akuapem citizens who acquired 
						virgin forest in 1954 at a place called Atom on Nkawie 
						and Nyinahin stool lands.&nbsp; The lands were granted to 
						them by Nana Kwasi Duah and Nana Kofi Marfo, chiefs of 
						Nyinahin and Nkawie respectively. They were actually 
						demarcated for them by the chief of pomaakrom with the 
						authority of the chiefs of Nkawie and Nyinahin.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellant averred 
						that he developed his portion of the land by making farm 
						and planting cocoa trees.&nbsp; He even gave part of his land 
						to one Kwame Tano testified as PW1.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellant described 
						the boundaries of his land by naming his boundary 
						owners. He added that in 1978 a surveyor who demarcated 
						its actual boundaries made a plan of his land for him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">According to the 
						appellant, Kwame Tano said his father had given him land 
						to farm upon. That was in 1981. While working on the 
						land of the appellant before 1981 Kwame Tano used to be 
						assisted by the first respondent. Therefore when Kwame 
						Tano decided to quit the land of the appellant, the 
						first respondent requested to be allowed to continue 
						farming on the land. The requested was granted. It was 
						while he was farming on the land that the dispute arose 
						was that dispute culminated in this litigation.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The respondents in this 
						appeal were the defendants at the trial court. They were 
						three at the time they filed their defence. The third 
						defendant died in the course of the trial. The evidence 
						indicated that the second defendant succeeded him but 
						the record did not show that there was a formal motion 
						for substitution. Since he was not legally substituted, 
						the judgment of the trial court and the judgment in this 
						court bind only the first and second respondents.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defence of the 
						defendants/respondents was that they admitted that some 
						ten Akuapem citizens acquired some tracks of land at 
						Atom. They however denied in their pleadings that the 
						disputed land was included in the land of the Akuapem 
						people. Rather they averred that the first respondent 
						was found farming on the disputed land. He was queried 
						by one Kwasi Addai, who was then the Odikro of Atom as 
						to how he acquired that land. He explained that the PW1 
						gave him the land. According to the first respondent, 
						the PW1 had gone to his hometown at Akanten. He 
						therefore went Akanten and called him before the Odikro 
						and his elders and the PW1 then explained that the land 
						was given to him by his (the PW1&#8217;s) father. The Odikro 
						and his elders rejected the explanation. The Odikro then 
						entered into an abunu tenancy agreement with the first 
						respondent in respect of the disputed land. As far as he 
						was concerned, the land belonged to the Odikro of Atom 
						and not the appellant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After the trial, the 
						High Court judge dismissed the appellant&#8217;s claim and 
						entered judgment for the respondent. The appellant then 
						appealed against that judgment to this court, initially 
						on the omnibus ground that the judgment was against the 
						weight of evidence. Five additional grounds were later 
						filed. By a unanimous decision of this court, the appeal 
						was allowed on the 7th October 1999. These are the 
						reason for that decision.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In sum, trial judge 
						dismissed the appellant&#8217;s case on three main grounds, 
						namely, that</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1. The appellant did 
						not know the extent of his land</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2. The appellant was 
						not in possession of the disputed land</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3. The appellant 
						adduced traditional evidence and therefore assumed a 
						higher onus of proof equivalent to proof in criminal 
						cases but he failed to establish that proof.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Not surprisingly 
						therefore, the appellant's first additional ground of 
						appeal was that</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The learned High Court 
						Judge misdirected himself in law and in fact by holding 
						that the plaintiff did not know the extent of his land, 
						when the Plaintiff and Defendant were ad idem as to the 
						identity of the land in dispute and so the question of 
						the extent of that land was irrelevant&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There can be no doubt 
						that the trial judge erred in his finding that the 
						appellant did not know the extent of his land. The 
						second and third respondents conceded in their pleadings 
						that the disputed land formed part of the land given to 
						the Akwapim citizens. Even the first respondent who made 
						no formal admission in his pleadings eventually conceded 
						under cross-examination that the disputed land was 
						included in the land given to the Akwapim tenant 
						farmers. In his testimony in court, the DW3 told the 
						trial court that he was among those who demarcated the 
						land to the Akwapim tenant farmers and he subsequently 
						saw the appellant working on it. He too confirmed that 
						the disputed land formed part of the land given to the 
						Akwapim citizens. All these showed that the parties and 
						witnesses were fully aware of the boundaries of the 
						disputed land otherwise they would not have known that 
						it formed part of the land given to the Akwapim people.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The reply of counsel 
						for the respondent on this issue simply did not answer 
						the point at stake. The evidence on record did not 
						support his point that the first respondent was assigned 
						a virgin forest. Exhibit 1 which he relied on not 
						override the strong evidence led by the appellant and 
						his witnesses that when the Odikro re-allocated it to 
						the first respondent the land was already in the&nbsp; 
						possession of the first respondent by virtue of the 
						permission which he the appellant gave to the first 
						respondent through the PW1. The second point made by 
						counsel for the respondent was that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;under customary law 
						cultivation practice, a yielding cocoa farm caretaker is 
						different from an abunu tenant (and) the appellant could 
						not have engaged the first defendant as an abunu tenant 
						for cocoa planted by Kwame Tano between 1969 and 1980.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">That point is 
						incomprehensible. If his view was that the first 
						respondent was given virgin forest, how could he argue 
						that the same virgin forest was &#8220;cocoa yielding&#8221;? In any 
						case his point that cocoa yielding farm could not be the 
						subject matter of the abunu tenancy has no basis at 
						customary law. It was no wonder that he cited no 
						authority for that proposition. Abunu tenancy is a 
						matter of agreement between parties and nothing prevents 
						the owner of the cocoa growing land from giving the land 
						out on abunu tenancy basis, if he so desires, and the 
						caretaker is willing to accept it. In any case, Exhibit 
						1, which the respondent railed on, related to abunu 
						tenancy but covered cocoa growing land as the first 
						respondent stated in evidence in chief.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A serious point in the 
						evidence which escaped the attention of the trial judge 
						was the fact that the appellant called his boundary 
						owners to show his boundaries with them when he was 
						proving the extent of his land. The well established 
						rule is that in the absence of undisputed survey plan or 
						other documentary evidence, boundary owners are the best 
						source of evidence to determine boundary: see ADWUBENG 
						VRS. DOMFEH (1996 &#8211; 87) SC GLR 668 at (672 &#8211;673). The 
						trial judge therefore erred when he used the fact of the 
						boundary owners as evidence that appellant did not know 
						his own boundaries or extent of his land. Rather, that 
						evidence should have been considered as more positive 
						proof of the appellant's boundaries.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellant's second 
						ground of appeal is that &#8220;the learned judge erred in law 
						by admitting the document marked Exhibit 1 and relying 
						on it when it had not been registered.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As counsel for the 
						appellant argued in his statement of case, Exhibit 1 
						should not have been given the weight assigned to it by 
						trial judge by reason of the Land Registration Act, 1962 
						Act 122), s24(l): as explained and applied in NARSTEY 
						VRS. MECHANICAL LLOYD (1987 - 88) 2GLR 314, SC and 
						ODAMETEY VRS. CLOCUH (1987-90) 1GLR 14 SC.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel for the 
						respondents did not react to that well founded 
						submission against Exhibit 1. In support of Ex.1, he 
						argued that the exhibit was valid because the Odikro of 
						Atom had the customary rights to grant virgin forest on 
						his stool land which had remained uncultivated from 
						1954-1975. The fallacy in that none of the parties 
						testified that the Odikro granted the land to the first 
						respondent because it had remained uncultivated from 
						1954 to 1975. It is not the duty of counsel to bridge 
						gaps in the case of litigants by arguments based on 
						evidence not put before the trial court. If the point 
						had been raised that the land had been uncultivated from 
						1954-975 no-one could anticipate what the appellant or 
						his witnesses would have said by way of reply. His 
						argument was therefore speculative. In any case how 
						valid will his argument be that the land remained 
						uncultivated from 1954-1975 when the first respondent 
						himself told the trial court that he assisted PW1 
						several years before he left the land to him and it was 
						while he was working on the land that the Odikro 
						questioned his presence on it?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The basic issue in this 
						case is one of possession. The trial judge clearly held 
						that the appellant was not in possession of the disputed 
						land. The validity of that finding depended on the 
						credibility of the appellant and the validity of Exhibit 
						B on one hand and on the other hand, the credibility of 
						the first respondent and the validity of Exhibit </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">All the parties were 
						agreeable that the appellant was one of the Akwapim 
						citizens who were given land at Atom village. The 
						evidence also showed that the disputed land was included 
						in the land given to them. There was also convincing 
						evidence that the first respondent and some boundary 
						owners participated in the making of Exhibit B when a 
						surveyor went to the land to survey it in preparation 
						for Exhibit B. Thus far, the case of the appellant could 
						hardly be faulted. In addition to these the very PW1 
						through whom the first respondent claimed to have first 
						entered the land testified on behalf of the appellant 
						that the land was given him by the appellant and no-one 
						else. Most importantly, the Chief of Nkawie who was one 
						of the owners of the land in the disputed area confirmed 
						that it was the appellant who acquired the land from the 
						owners.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the other hand the 
						story of .the first respondent bristled with serious 
						inconsistencies, which rendered the defence of the 1st 
						and 2nd respondents almost impossible. It was therefore 
						seriously discredited. Some of the pieces of evidence 
						highlighting the conflict and consistencies were these: 
						In particular the first respondent stated in his 
						evidence that the PW1 took him to the disputed land in 
						November 1974. He added that in 1976 the PW1 left Atom 
						to his hometown in Akanteng and stayed there 
						continuously for nine years from 1976. If he left in 
						1976 and stayed there continuously for nine years how 
						could he, the same first respondent, be believed when he 
						told the court that the PW1 was in his hometown and he 
						had to call him from there at the instance of Atom 
						Odikro to explain how he came by the land and when his 
						explanation was found unsatisfactory, Atom Odikro 
						reallocated the disputed land to him in 1975? Exhibit 1 
						stated that the reallocation was made in 
						1975.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How 
						could the PW1 have gone to his village in 1976 to be 
						recalled from there&#8212;prior to the making of Exhibit 1 
						dated 1975? When counsel for the appellant submitted 
						that Exhibit 1 was void ab initio, there was a lot to be 
						said in favour of that submission.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The story of the first 
						respondent as a whole was not credible. By his own 
						showing, he went to stay with the PW1 as a young man 
						aged about 14 years or 18years.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At that time he merely 
						assisted the PW1 to make the farm and later was placed 
						on an apprenticeship as a tailor. At the time he was 
						assisting the PW1 it was the PW1 himself who was in 
						charge of the land and the farm. The PW1 told the court 
						that he obtained the land from the appellant. The first 
						respondent said that he had been informed by the PW1 
						that it was his father who owned the land. When the 
						trial judge had to decide the credibility of the adult 
						farmer in charge of the farm as against a teenage farm 
						help, surely he could not be right in preferring the 
						latter to the former.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The first respondent 
						said the PW1 told him that the land belonged to the 
						PW1&#8217;s father. He added that the real complainant was the 
						PW1's father. The PW1 would not have been called from 
						his hometown if he was not the one who gave the land to 
						the first respondent. In fact the first respondent said 
						the father was alive even at the time he testified in 
						1994. While the real owner was alive and around the 
						place where the dispute was being settled, there was no 
						need to have called the PW1 from his hometown and yet 
						the first respondent insisted that he was the one who 
						called him from his hometown.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In addition to all 
						these, the claim of the second respondent that the 
						disputed land was under the paramountcy of the Akodie 
						stool was challenged by the appellant and his witnesses 
						and yet the defendants/respondents called no one to 
						testify in support of their assertion even though the 
						stool of Akodie should obviously have had an occupant at 
						the time the trial was going on. The trial judge should 
						not have believed the respondents, especially the second 
						respondent, who claimed to have succeeded the original 
						Odikro of Atom village. Although he tried to hedge under 
						cross-examination his evidence showed that the Atom 
						village was under Nkawie and Nyinahin stools until 1982 
						when he claimed that it was placed under the Akodie 
						stool. Even if his story was correct, those who had 
						acquired rights under the original paramountcy could not 
						be dispossessed of those rights merely because Atom 
						village had been placed under Akodie stool. The new 
						paramountcy took over the rights and liabilities of the 
						village brought under it but not only their assets.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In support of their 
						cases the respondents called the DW1. His evidence did 
						not advance their case in any serious manner because he 
						testified of even after 1991 while the issue of 
						ownership was contested from 1954. Similarly the 
						evidence of the DW2 did not help the respondents since 
						he testified on events after the second respondent had 
						decided to re-allocate the land to the first respondent 
						but not on the actual events touching on the acquisition 
						of the land in 1954 or from 1974 to 1975.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">All these established 
						beyond any doubt that the appellant was the one who was 
						in possession of the disputed land throughout the DW1 
						and who later introduced the first respondent there. 
						That also showed that indirectly the first respondent's 
						possession was on behalf of the appellant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In his evidence, the 
						first respondent told the court that after the 
						re-allocation the second respondent sent the land to be 
						demarcated for him and &#8220;the land they showed me was the 
						same land given to me earlier on by Kwame Tano (PW1)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The PW3 who was among 
						those who were originally sent by the predecessors of 
						the second respondent to demarcate the land in 1954 said 
						finally under cross-examination &#8220;I now say that the land 
						in dispute is within the land given to the Akwapim 
						tenant farmers.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The allocation of the 
						land to the appellant by the predecessors of the second 
						respondent was binding on the second respondent and his 
						stool elders. They therefore had no title to the land 
						already given away by their predecessors. As counsel for 
						the appellant rightly put, it was a clear case of &#8220;Nemo 
						dat quod non habet.&#8221; That was similar to the 
						reallocation of lands at Botianor by the new occupant of 
						the James Town stool after his predecessor, Nii Adja 
						Kwao II had granted the same lands to Vanderpuye Orgle 
						Estates. On the decision whether or not the 
						re-allocation was valid the Supreme Court held that the 
						grants made by Nii Adja Kwao were valid and binding on 
						the James Town stool. See REPUBLIC vrs. LANDS 
						COMMISSIONS; EXPARTE VANDERPUYE ORGLE ESTATES. Supreme 
						Court, Civil Appeal No.15/96, dated 13th January 1999, 
						unreported. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This case supports the 
						view that the actions of the predecessors of Atom 
						village in granting the lands are binding on the new 
						Odikro of Atom village in the person of the second 
						respondent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the third ground of 
						appeal the record did not disclose that the appellant 
						led traditional evidence. Even if he did, the law had 
						long been settled that in civil proceedings the onus of 
						proof remains on the balance of probabilities. The 
						Evidence Decree, 1975 (NRCD 323), requires proof by a 
						&#8220;preponderance of probabilities&#8221; which has been defined 
						on s. 12(2). In SERWAH vrs. KESSE (1960) GLR 227 and 
						228, the Supreme Court held that proof in a civil case 
						is less than that on the prosecution in a criminal 
						trial. Cases which have equated proof in civil cases 
						with proof in criminal cases are per incuriam because of 
						the provisions in NCRD 323 and SERWAH vrs. KESSE and may 
						not be followed. The trial judge consequently erred in 
						his statement that the appellant assumed a higher 
						standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Proof of the 
						traditional evidence is not one the exceptions to the 
						rule that in civil cases, proof is by a balance of 
						probabilities or on a preponderance of probabilities.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Two findings made by 
						the trial judge on the admissibility of Exhibit 1 and 
						alleged &#8220;nefarious conduct&#8221; were the subject matters of 
						grounds four and five of the grounds of appeal. His 
						finding that Exhibit 1 was not objected to was not borne 
						out by the evidence. The record showed that it was 
						objected to and he had to rule on the objection after 
						hearing arguments from counsel. The second finding of 
						&#8220;nefarious conduct&#8221; on the part of the appellant was not 
						explained. There was nothing &#8220;nefarious&#8221; about an 
						Akwapim citizen taking land in Ashanti or Brong-Ahafo 
						and leaving it in the hands of a caretaker. And surely, 
						there was nothing wrong or &#8220;nefarious&#8221; with that tenant 
						with that tenant farmer insisting on his rights and 
						fighting to recover land wrongly wrestled from him and 
						re-allocated to a man who was his own caretaker but had 
						turned round to virtually stab him in the back by 
						accepting a reallocation of the very land entrusted to 
						him to take care of. If any conduct in this case to be 
						described as &#8220;nefarious&#8221;, the expression &#8220;nefarious 
						conduct&#8221; befits the first respondent more than any other 
						litigant or witness in this case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At the end of the 
						trial, the evidence disclosed beyond doubt that the 
						first respondent was placed on the land by the appellant 
						but through the PW1. He clearly challenged the authority 
						or title of his landlord or landlords by stating 
						categorically that the land belonged to the second 
						respondents. He therefore forfeited his right to 
						continue being on the land because from the evidence the 
						land did not belong to the second respondent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was for all the 
						foregoing reasons, that the court allowed the appeal and 
						entered judgement for the appellant. The appellant was 
						the one entitled to the disputed land. The first 
						respondent should render accounts on his operations on 
						the land as per the original writ of summons. Order of 
						perpetual injunction is also made for the appellant 
						against the respondents in respect of the disputed land 
						but within the terms of the original agreement on the 
						land made in 1954.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The record shows that 
						there were efforts to amend the writ of summons or 
						endorsement on the writ. There was no evidence of the 
						motion for amendment having been argued before the trial 
						court. Those amendments will not therefore be taken in 
						substitution of the original writ. The judgment is given 
						in the terms of the original writ issued on July 1991.</span></p>
