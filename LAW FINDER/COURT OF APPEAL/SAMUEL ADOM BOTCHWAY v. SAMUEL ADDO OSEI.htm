						<span style="font-family: Arial">LARTEY, J.A.:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This appeal is from the 
						judgment of the High Court, Accra dated the 28th day of 
						January, 1991, and it was brought by the 
						defendant/appellant (hereinafter simply referred to as 
						the defendant). On the 29th January, 1987 the 
						Plaintiff/Respondent (hereinafter also referred to as 
						the Plaintiff) commenced an action against the 
						defendant, claiming among other reliefs, for an order 
						nullifying a conveyance purporting to have been executed 
						by the plaintiff in favour of the defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff avers 
						that he owns a parcel of land at Dzorwulu, Accra for 
						which he had been in undisputed possession since 1960. 
						In 1985 he was approached by a prospective purchaser for 
						the sale of a portion of the land for which he received 
						¢20,000. According to the plaintiff he gave the 
						prospective buyer a copy of his site plan to enable the 
						purchaser to satisfy himself from a search at the Lands 
						Department, after which the sale transaction would be 
						concluded or perfected. The search, however, revealed 
						the existence, at the Lands Title Registry of a document 
						of conveyance purporting to bear the plaintiff's 
						signature and purported to have conveyed a portion of 
						the plaintiff's land to the defendant. The plaintiff 
						denied knowing the defendant and denied having anything 
						to do with him in connection with the disputed land or 
						the disputed document.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff further 
						avers that upon being confronted later, the defendant 
						confessed that a wrong person had sold, or conveyed 
						title in, the plaintiff's land to him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">For his part, the 
						defendant claimed that the plaintiff introduced himself 
						to him in 1985 as owner of the disputed land. According 
						to the defendant, he bought the land from one Kwesi 
						Tetteh, a Togolese, who prepared a conveyance on the 
						land to him, the same having been registered in the 
						Deeds Registry as No. 1609/84. In addition the defendant 
						stated that the said Kwesi Tetteh brought him a document 
						evidencing transfer of the land from the plaintiff to 
						the defendant. He claims he had no doubt about the 
						genuineness of the signature on the document purporting 
						to be that of the plaintiff, as indeed subsequent police 
						report on the document proved him right. He denied 
						giving a confession statement to the plaintiff and 
						maintains that he has valid title to the disputed land. 
						The defendant counterclaimed for a declaration that he 
						is the owner in possession of the land in dispute. He 
						also counterclaimed for the return of the sum of 
						¢50,000.00 with interest thereon alleged to be money the 
						plaintiff took on 30th June, 1985 with a view to 
						reselling the land to him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I preface this judgment 
						with an examination of the notice and additional grounds 
						of appeal filed in this case against the background of 
						the relevant rule in C.I.19 (The Court of Appeal Rules, 
						1997 as amended). Rule 8(7) thereof states:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The appellant shall 
						not, without the leave of the Court, urge or be heard in 
						support of any ground of objection not mentioned in the 
						notice of appeal, but the Court may allow the appellant 
						to amend the grounds of appeal upon such terms as the 
						Court may think just.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The requirement for 
						entertaining any ground not mentioned in the notice of 
						appeal is that the appellant, prior to being heard in 
						argument in support of the grounds of appeal, must have 
						obtained leave of the court or leave to amend any of the 
						grounds of appeal. Failure to comply with the sub-rule 
						empowers the court to preclude any argument that may be 
						canvassed in support of the grounds. In this case, there 
						is nothing to show that leave was first granted the 
						defendant, who now appeals, before he filed his long 
						list of additional grounds. Again the written submission 
						of the plaintiff offers no clue as to whether leave was 
						first obtained by the defendant. The plaintiff's 
						submission merely states certain facts as perceived by 
						the plaintiff without answering the several specific 
						points of law raised in the additional grounds of 
						appeal. Although the notice of appeal refers to other 
						grounds to be filed upon the record of proceedings being 
						made available, it is important to stress the need for 
						strict compliance of the rules for the purpose of 
						regularising any defect or omission that may be 
						discovered in the appeal process.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I now turn to the 
						additional grounds of appeal as if granted with the 
						leave of this court. But before proceeding further, I 
						would like, for the sake of convenience, to deal with 
						the grounds in groups since many of them are replicate 
						of others. For instance, a close look at the additional 
						grounds will reveal that ground (x) replicate grounds 
						(iii) and (iv). That being the case, it is simpler and 
						more convenient to deal with them together.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The import of those 
						grounds is simply that it was the plaintiff who lodged a 
						complaint of forgery with the police against the 
						defendant, and therefore it was the plaintiff who bore 
						the burden of persuasion on the issue of the signature - 
						the subject matter of the police report. It was further 
						argued that the trial court erred in failing to attach 
						due weight to the signature, which to all intents and 
						purposes, negatived the charge of forgery on the part of 
						the defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This argument seems to 
						suggest that the clue to the charge of forgery was 
						solved once and for all by the so-called police report, 
						which was never seen by the trial court. In other words, 
						since the police concluded that the signature was that 
						of the plaintiff the court should have entered judgment 
						for the defendant. I will respectfully disagree with 
						this line of argument, because of the view I hold that 
						the signature per se is not the sole element to look for 
						in deciding the issue of forgery having regard to the 
						peculiar circumstances of this case. The question may be 
						posed as to whether it is not uncommon for persons with 
						criminal intent to superimpose genuine signatures on 
						forged documents for the purpose of robbing victims of 
						their valuable assets? If the answer is in the 
						affirmative, one will not be tempted to conclude that 
						the signature alone should be the deciding factor to 
						tilt the balance in favour of the defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It seems to me that the 
						better approach or option is to look at the document as 
						a whole to discover other pieces of evidence of forgery. 
						The relevant document in this case is exhibit 'B' which 
						purports to convey title in the disputed land to the 
						defendant. A close examination of exhibit 'B' will show 
						that if indeed any interest in the land was assigned to 
						the defendant through Kwesi Tetteh, it is Kwesi Tetteh's 
						name which would appear on it as purchaser and not the 
						name of the defendant. Alternately, if the land was sold 
						by Kwesi Tetteh as claimed by the defendant, Kwesi 
						Tetteh's name would appear on the document at the 
						vendor.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Furthermore, Kwesi 
						Tetteh on exhibit 'B' purported to be present, 
						presumably as a witness to the execution of the 
						document. Therefore the defendant could not validly 
						derive any title from someone described merely as a 
						witness in this particular instrument. Again, before 
						this action was mounted and even with the help of the 
						police neither Kwesi Tetteh nor Baffour Kyei could be 
						traced, although both names appear in the document. The 
						irresistible inference is that both names are imaginary, 
						designed to from part of a grand design in furtherance 
						of the forgery intent. And even if the police concluded 
						that what appeared thereon was the plaintiff's 
						signature, it was, as alluded to above and in all 
						probability superimposed on the document to give it a 
						semblance of genuineness. It is my view therefore that 
						the argument relating to the plaintiff's signature on 
						exhibit 'B' will in no way strengthen the defendant's 
						case, because the whole document is spurious. I entirely 
						agree with the learned trial judge's observation on the 
						point when he said that &quot;nothing much turns on the 
						signature.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I propose to deal with 
						additional grounds (vi), (vii) and (viii) together which 
						relate to &quot;police report&quot; and the alleged failure on the 
						part of the plaintiff to discharge the burden of proof 
						on that issue. I concede that under section 14 of the 
						Evidence Decree, 1975 (NRCD 323) the burden of 
						persuasion is normally on the party whose case the fact 
						is essential in this case the plaintiff. The complaint 
						lodged by the plaintiff on the issue of forgery no doubt 
						contemplated criminal prosecution of the perpetrator. 
						The police in the normal course of their work examined 
						the signature and came to the conclusion that it was the 
						plaintiff's signature.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Notwithstanding that 
						finding, it ought to be noted that at the time hearing 
						of this civil action commenced the issue of signature 
						had ceased to be of essence to the plaintiff's case. And 
						since it was no longer essential to his case, the 
						plaintiff had no obligation to, as it were, drag the 
						police into a purely civil litigation. I do not think 
						the non-involvement of the police in this matter amounts 
						to failure on the part of the plaintiff to discharge the 
						burden of proof.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As I indicated earlier 
						on in this judgment, there are sufficient pieces of 
						evidence on the record from which inference of forgery 
						can be made, the signature or police report 
						notwithstanding. I find no merit in those grounds.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Grounds (xi) and (xii) 
						raise the principle of bona fide purchaser for value 
						without notice. By that principle, a purchaser of 
						property for valuable consideration should not be 
						prejudicially affected by notice of any instrument, fact 
						or thing unless it is within the purchaser's own 
						knowledge. But will the principle apply to the benefit 
						of the defendant in this case? From the evidence of the 
						defendant during cross-examination the following 
						questions and answers appear:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Q. Have you ever seen 
						the document which made Kwesi Tetteh owner of the land?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp;&nbsp; No.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before you bought 
						the land did you make a search?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp;&nbsp; No.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you see a 
						document between Kwesi Tetteh and anybody about this 
						land?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp;&nbsp; No. &quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">From the defendant's 
						own admissions it is obvious that he failed to mount his 
						own inquiry or inspection which could have revealed any 
						incumbrance on the property purported to have been 
						bought in good faith.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my view, failure to 
						make his own search or satisfy himself of the existence 
						of a genuine document made between Kwesi Tetteh and the 
						plaintiff will not entitle the defendant to seek 
						protection of the law under the maxim. These additional 
						grounds should equally collapse.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Turning to the first 
						ground of appeal, it is difficult to agree with learned 
						counsel for the defendant that the trial court's 
						judgment is unreasonable. In the first place, it was the 
						case of the defendant that he bought the property from 
						Kwesi Tetteh who in exhibit 'B' is only a witness and 
						who thumb-printed in that capacity. There is nothing in 
						the said document which suggests that title in the 
						disputed land resides in Kwesi Tetteh. Accordingly Kwesi 
						Tetteh had nothing to pass on to the defendant, and the 
						defendant on his part obtained no interest for which he 
						seeks a declaration of title to the disputed land as per 
						his counterclaim. I think the maxim nemo dat quod non 
						habet is clearly applicable because no one, as in the 
						instant case, can give that which he has not. In the 
						result the first and second reliefs in the counterclaim 
						cannot succeed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">With regard to the 
						third prayer of the counterclaim, it is pertinent to 
						note that the date for the payment of the ¢50,000.00 was 
						on 30 June, 1985.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Now at the tail and of 
						his counsel's written submission in this appeal, the 
						defendant applies for leave for the withdrawal of the 
						money claim and substitute same for an order for 
						specific performance with a further order for the 
						defendant to pay the balance of the purchase price. The 
						date of payment of the ¢50,000.00 as disclosed in the 
						counterclaim seems to me to be quite significant. If 
						part-payment for the land was made on the said date, the 
						inference was that there had been an agreement between 
						the parties to resell the disputed land to the 
						defendant. If that was the case then what was the need 
						for writing exhibit 'C' dated 8th September, 1985 
						wherein the defendant promises to meet the plaintiff on 
						10th September, 1985 &quot;to settle the land case which was 
						given to Mr. Osei by wrong person Mr. Tetteh Kwesi&quot;? 
						This exhibit debunks the defendant's story that before 
						8th September, 1985 there had been an agreement by which 
						the plaintiff was to resell the land to him. The money 
						he gave to the plaintiff was certainly not for the 
						purchase of land; it was for something else, possibly 
						for the purpose of pacifying the plaintiff for his 
						ordeal during his arrest and detention by the military 
						personnel. This explains why no receipt was issued for 
						the payment. If the money was meant to cover 
						part-payment for an interest in land the defendant might 
						have promptly pressed for the issuance of a receipt, 
						since any transaction about land should be evidenced in 
						writing by a memorandum.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Again if the money paid 
						by the defendant was for the conveyance of an interest 
						in land, why did he fail to counterclaim for an order 
						for specific performance in the first place? Why did the 
						defendant counterclaim for a refund of ¢50,000.00 with 
						interest thereon at a time when he knew that the payment 
						was for the purchase of land? His sudden turn for an 
						order for specific performance is an after-thought 
						simply because he failed to get what he wanted, namely 
						the transfer of an interest in the land to him by the 
						plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff does not 
						dispute accepting the ¢50,000.00 and as stated earlier 
						from the evaluation of the evidence on the record, the 
						payment was not made upon the contemplation of a promise 
						to convey any interest in the land to the defendant. The 
						explanation given by the plaintiff was that the 
						defendant came to refund the money which the plaintiff's 
						cousin paid on his behalf when he (the plaintiff) was in 
						custody of the military police. According to the 
						plaintiff, the defendant expressed regret for having put 
						him (the plaintiff) in &quot;that position&quot;. The trial judge 
						ordered that the ¢50,000.00 be refunded to the defendant 
						with interest at the current bank rate from September, 
						1985 to the date of the judgment, I find the order a 
						little strange and disturbing because the refund is not 
						based on any contract for which the consideration has 
						failed. I find no justification in the order so made. I 
						think the whole counterclaim should have been dismissed, 
						and it is so dismissed by this court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the result, this 
						appeal is dismissed and the judgment of the trial court 
						in favour of the plaintiff is affirmed. The plaintiff 
						will have his costs fixed at ¢5,000,000.00.</span></p>

						<span style="font-family: Arial">Additional grounds

						court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The report is in 
						respect of the Plaintiff/Respondent's alleged signature 
						on EX&quot;B&quot;, on indenture purportedly prepared by the 
						Respondent in favour of the Appellant. The Respondent 
						denied that the signature is his signature and had the 
						occassion to lodge a complaint of forgery in respect of 
						same with the police.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The evidence is that 
						the signature was certified as that of the Respondent. 
						This report was never tendered at the trial nor was the 
						maker of that report called as a witness before the 
						court for him to be cross-examined with a view to 
						testing how he arrived at the conclusion that the 
						signature is that of the Respondent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In his judgment, the 
						trial judge in dealing with the signature, had this to 
						say;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Nothing much turns on 
						the signature,&quot; and this counsel for the Appellant in 
						ground (iii) says, is a misdirection and error of law 
						since the report was prepared following the Respondent's 
						own complaint of forgery to the police. The trial judge 
						could not dwell on a report which was not before the 
						court and the veracity of which had not been tested in 
						court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In view of the 
						Respondent's denial that the signature is his, the 
						principle of law is that the Appellant who sought to 
						rely on it, and was alleging the positive had to prove 
						the authenticity of the signature. In the absence of any 
						such proof, I am unable to appreciate how the trial 
						Judge misdirected himself and erred in law by how he 
						treated the alleged report on the signature as nothing 
						of much importance.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the light of EX &quot;C&quot; 
						which is an acknowledgment by the Appellant that the 
						land was given to him &quot;by wrong person Mr. Tetteh Kwesi, 
						he relinguished his hold on EX &quot;B&quot; as conferring title 
						on him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After all, in EX &quot;B&quot; he 
						and the Respondent are the parties to the transaction. 
						Kwesi Tetteh is not his alleged vendor. It was never his 
						case that the Respondent sold any land to him. That if 
						anything at all, there was only an agreement to sell the 
						land to him as he contended. The Respondent did not 
						accuse the Appellant of forgery. All that he claimed was 
						that the signature on Ex &quot;B&quot; is not his signature.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Indeed, I am in 
						complete agreement with the trial Judge that &quot;nothing 
						much turns on the signature&quot; and that for the reasons 
						already stated, EX &quot;B&quot; could not confer any title on the 
						Appellant.</span></p>
