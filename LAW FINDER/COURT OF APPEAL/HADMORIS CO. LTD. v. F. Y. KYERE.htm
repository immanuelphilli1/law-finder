						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The question my lords 
						which confronts us in this appeal is whether the learned 
						trial judge was right in awarding interest on the sum of 
						twenty&nbsp; nine million&nbsp; cedis&nbsp; only and not on the entire 
						amount of fifty four million cedis which was indorsed on 
						the writ of summons which initiated the action in the 
						court below? In this delivery, for the sake of 
						convenience, I shall refer to the parties as they were 
						described in the court below. In the judgment with which 
						we are concerned in this appeal, the learned trial judge 
						limited the interest which he awarded to the amount in 
						respect of which he entered judgment in the course of 
						the proceedings at page 12 of the record in the 
						following words:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&#8220;Judgment for 
						plaintiff in the sum of ¢29, 000,000.00.&nbsp; Costs of 5 
						million cedis to plaintiff. Court defers question of 
						interest to parties to negotiate. Adjourned to 
						15/3/2000.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The said entry of 
						judgment was preceded by the payment into court by the 
						defendant of the sum of twenty five million cedis, it 
						being part of the claim indorsed on the writ of summons 
						initiating the action. On the day that the parties 
						appeared before the learned trial judge for the issue of 
						interest to be decided by the court after listening to 
						the respective counsel, he awarded interest at the 
						prevailing bank rate&nbsp; and expressed it to be in respect 
						of twenty nine million cedis. In their complaint before 
						us the plaintiffs&nbsp; have raised the following&nbsp; grounds:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1) That the court 
						failed or refused to award interest on the whole amount 
						of ¢54,000,000.00 claimed by the plaintiff and awarded 
						interest in part on ¢29,000,000.00</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) The ¢25,000,000.00 
						that the court did not award interest thereon is 
						unreasonable and not known to the rules.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have examined the 
						respective statements submitted to us by the parties 
						through their counsel and I am of the view that the 
						learned trial judge erred by not awarding the interest 
						on the entire sum claimed. I think that the discretion 
						which is bestowed on him under the law namely The Courts 
						(Award of Interest) Instrument (LI 1295) should have 
						been in respect of the entire amount for which the 
						plaintiff was compelled to claim in his indorsement once 
						the said amount was found due by the court to it. In my 
						view this is clearly borne out by the formulation in the 
						said instrument which reads:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Where in any civil 
						cause or matter the Court makes an order for the payment 
						of interest on any sum due to the plaintiff other than 
						any sum claimed by the plaintiff under Order 13 rule 3 
						of the High Court (Civil Procedure Rules, 1954 (LN 140A) 
						the rate shall be payable at the Bank rate prevailing at 
						the time the order was made by the Court, but no 
						compound interest shall be awarded.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I wish to say that from 
						the proceedings before us it is quite clear in view of 
						the&nbsp; course of conduct which the defendant took 
						resulting in the entry of judgment against him that he 
						had as it were admitted the claim made against him 
						contained in the plaintiff's demand and therefore he is 
						deemed to have admitted the pleadings on which the claim 
						was based that he had received the amounts from the 
						farmers but refused to pay the same over to the 
						plaintiff, a situation which in the words of Herschel LC 
						in London, Chatham and Dover Railway Co v South Eastern 
						Railway Co [1893] AC 429 @ 437 justifies an award of 
						interest. In his words which were approved by Acquah J. 
						(as he then was) in the case of Heloo v Tettey [1992] 2 
						GLR 112 @ 123&nbsp; he&nbsp; said:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220; I think that when 
						money is owing from one party to another and the other 
						is driven to have recourse to legal proceedings in order 
						to recover the amount due to him, the party who is 
						wrongfully withholding the money from the other ought 
						not in justice to benefit by having that money in his 
						possession&nbsp; and enjoying&nbsp; the use of it, when the money 
						ought to be in the possession of the other party who is 
						entitled to its use.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I think that in 
						limiting the award of interest to the sum in respect of 
						which the Court entered judgment only the learned trial 
						judge lost sight of the fact that the proceedings which 
						resulted in the entry of judgment in the said sum only 
						and not the whole amount was such that the defendant had 
						submitted to judgment on the amount claimed and 
						therefore justified an award of interest on the entire 
						sum as claimed in the writ of summons. It is clear from 
						the proceedings that but for the said amount which was 
						paid by the defendant the entry of judgment would have 
						been in respect of the entire amount claimed in the 
						writ. The situation would have been different if the 
						Court had found for the plaintiff in a lesser sum. In my 
						thinking this view of the record would be the same 
						whether one takes the view that the judgment was on 
						admissions or a summary judgment under Order 14 rule 1 
						of the High Court rules for it was a judgment on the 
						entire claim which was demanded by the plaintiff from 
						the defendant. It follows as said earlier on that the 
						appeal herein succeeds the result of which is that I set 
						aside the award of interest which was made in respect 
						only of twenty nine million cedis and in place thereof 
						substitute an award at the then prevailing bank rate in 
						the sum claimed on the writ of summons namely fifty four 
						million cedis from the date of issue of the writ to the 
						date of judgment.</span></p>
