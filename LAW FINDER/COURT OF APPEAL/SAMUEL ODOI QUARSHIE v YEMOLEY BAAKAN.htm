						<span style="font-family: Arial">ESSILFIE-BONDZIE, J.A.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is an appeal from 
						the judgment of the Circuit Court Accra dated 20th day 
						of October, 2000. By a writ of Summons filed on the 3rd 
						March, 1999 the Plaintiff/Respondent (who, will hence 
						forth known as the plaintiff) sued for himself and the 
						family of Quarshie and claimed against the 
						defendant/appellant (who will hereinafter referred to as 
						the defendant) the following reliefs:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) A declaration of 
						title to all that piece or parcel of land lying and 
						situate at La, near Degaulle Park measuring an 
						approximate area of 0.21 acres.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) Declaration that 
						the Plaintiffs are the bona fide owners of land 
						measuring and covering an approximate of 0.21 acres.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) Perpetual 
						Injunction restraining the defendant, assigns and 
						privies from having any thing to do with the said land 
						or interfering with the ownership and possession rights 
						of the Plaintiff and his family over the said land.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d)&nbsp; Replacement of 600 
						pieces of block or its equivalent in cedis.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is necessary at this 
						stage to give a brief account of the genesis of this 
						suit. The plaintiff' representative, Mr. Samuel Odoi 
						Quarshie is first cousin to the defendant. They Come 
						from two twin brothers Erasmus Akuetteh Quarshie and Oko 
						Yemoh. Plaintiff's father is Erasmus and the defendant's 
						father is Oko Yemoh. The two brothers had one sister 
						called Yemoteley Quarshie.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff's case, 
						was that some time ago, his family's land situate at La 
						near Degualle Park in Accra, was earmarked for public 
						purpose. To avoid losing the land, the family mandated 
						the defendant his Cousin, to use all possible means to 
						reclaim the land for the family which she succeeded in 
						doing. According to the plaintiff the defendant was 
						reimbursed for expenses incurred and the land was shared 
						equally between three beneficiaries Namely his father, 
						Erasmus Akuetteh Quarshie, Yemoteley Quarshie and Oko 
						Yemoh. It was contended by the plaintiff that the 
						defendant had her father's and also took that of their, 
						aunt Yemoteley Quarshie's share arguing that since the 
						Aunt had no child she would be buring her when she died. 
						The Plaintiff alleged that since the division of the 
						land, he has exercised control over his fathers portion 
						without any hindrance. The defendant, he alleged was 
						laying, adverse claim to this father's land and had 
						appropriated 600, blocks belonging to his father which 
						she had failed to replace or pay for.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendant denied 
						the plaintiff claim that the piece of land is family 
						land which was shared amongst two brothers and a sister. 
						It was her case that she purchased the land from the 
						Lands Commission Secretariat in her own right for 
						herself and that the land in dispute is hers, not by 
						inheritance from her father or her aunt Yemoteley 
						Quarshie. As to the 600 blocks she said she paid ¢2,400 
						to plaintiff father for it. It is therefore not true 
						that she failed to pay for these blocks.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendant also 
						counter claimed for declaration of title. The defendant 
						lost the suit. Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the 
						decision of the Circuit Court, the defendant has 
						appealed to this Court. She filed two original Grounds 
						of Appeal and four additional Grounds of Appeal. In this 
						appeal however I propose to deal with Ground One of the 
						original grounds appeal and Ground one of the additional 
						grounds of appeal which I consider relevant to the 
						determination of the appeal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Before I commence to 
						deal with the said Grounds of the appeal, I want to have 
						on record the fact that the Court docket, indicates that 
						the plaintiff/respondent was served with the written 
						submission of the defendant on the 9th December, 2003. 
						As on the 12th February when the appeal came on for 
						hearing, no written submission had been filed by the 
						Respondent (i.e for a period of more than 30 days) in 
						accordance, with Rule 20 (4) of C.I. 19 which stipulates 
						a period of 21 days after service of the appellants 
						written submission under the circumstances the appeal 
						was adjourned to day for judgment. The inference is that 
						the plaintiff respondents did not want to contest the 
						appeal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Be that as it may I 
						will proceed to deal with the appeal on its merits. 
						Ground One of the original grounds of appeal states that 
						&quot;The judgment of the trial Court is unreasonable and 
						cannot be supported having regard to the nature of 
						evidence adduced at the trial&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The established 
						principle in land Law is that a plaintiff in an action 
						for a declaration of title assumed the heavy burden of 
						proof and the plaintiff must succeed by the strength of 
						his own case and not by the weakness of the defendant's 
						case. See OPPONG KOFI and ANOTHER vrs. FOFIE [1964] 
						G.L.R. 174 SC, BANGA and OTHERS vrs. DJANIE and ANOTHER. 
						[1989-90] G.L.R. 510.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instance case, 
						the plaintiff averred by his statement of claim that 
						sometime ago his family land situate at La near Degaulle 
						Park in Accra, was earmarked for public purpose. To 
						avoid losing the land, the family mandated the 
						Defendant, his cousin to reclaim the land for the family 
						which she succeeded in doing. The land was subsequently 
						shared equally between three beneficiaries namely his 
						father, Erasmus Akuetteh Quarshie and Yemoteley 
						Quarshie. That since the division he had exercised 
						control over his father's portion without any 
						interference. He alleged that the defendant was laying 
						adverse claim to his fathers land and has appropriated 
						600 blocks belonging to his father. The defendant 
						disputed the plaintiff&#8217;s claim by a statement of defence 
						and a counter-claim.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The record of 
						proceedings disclosed that although the plaintiff's 
						pleadings and averments were denied by the defendant he 
						entered the witness box, repeated the averment in the 
						statement of claim and closed his case. He failed to 
						adduce any corroborative evidence whatsoever to 
						substantiate his case. He did not call any witness and 
						never proffered any documentary evidence. In the often 
						cited case of MAJOLABI vrs. LARBI &amp; ORS, [1959] G.L.R. 
						190 at p. 192, OLLENU J. (as he then was) stated the law 
						on proof as follows: &#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;proof in law, is the 
						establishment of fact by proper legal means, in other 
						words, the establishment of an averment by admissible 
						evidence. Where a party makes an averment and his 
						averment is denied, he is unlikely to be held by the 
						Court to have sufficiently proved that averment by his 
						merely going into the witness box, and repeating the 
						averment on oath, if he does not adduce, that 
						corroborative evidence that corroborative evidence which 
						(if his averment be true) is certain to exist&quot; Learned 
						Counsel for the defendant argued that the plaintiff 
						failed to endorse on the Writ of summons a clear 
						description of the area of land he was claiming. By a 
						notice of amendment filed on the 9th March, 2000 the 
						plaintiff sought leave to amend the relief (a) endorsed 
						on the writ of summons. He sought to amend the extent of 
						the land in dispute from 0.21 acres to 0.70 acres. The 
						trial court granted the plaintiff's application for 
						amendment by an order dated 3/4/2003. It is however 
						evident from the record of proceedings that the 
						plaintiff failed to file an amended writ of summons, 
						pursuant to the said order. Now since the plaintiff did 
						not amend the endorsement on the Writ according to the 
						terms granting the order, before the expiration of 
						fourteen (14) days of the order, the order for amendment 
						became ipso facto void, the learned trial judge 
						therefore went wrong when he entered judgment for the 
						purported land size of 0.70 acres, although no amendment 
						of the Writ had been effected.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It must be pointed out 
						that since the plaintiff, lay claim to a specific land 
						area, it is his duty to give oral evidence clearly 
						showing the area of land to which his claim relates. In 
						his evidence in chief the plaintiff when questioned, 
						merely said &quot;The land is at Degualle Park. I have a site 
						plan to the land. The original is at home.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The settled Law is that 
						it is the duty of a plaintiff who comes to court to 
						claim a declaration of title to establish positively the 
						identity of the land to which the claimed title.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The pertinent question 
						posed here is: Did the plaintiff succeed in establishing 
						the identity of the land according to Law so as to 
						entitle him to a declaration of title and the other 
						relief of injunction he sought.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In ANANE vrs. DONKOR 
						[1965] G.L.R. 188 at p. 192 the then Supreme Court per 
						Ollennu, S.C. stated the law as follows: &#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Where a Court grants 
						declaration of title to land or an order for injunction 
						in respect of land the land subject of that declaration 
						should be clearly identified so that an order for 
						possession can be executed without difficulty and also 
						if the order for injunction is violated, the person in 
						contempt can be punished. If the boundaries of such land 
						are not clearly established a judgment or order of the 
						court will be in vain. Again if a judgment for 
						declaration of title to land should operate as RES 
						JUDICATA to prevent the parties relitigating the same 
						issues in respect of the identical subject matter but it 
						cannot operate unless the subject matter thereof is 
						clearly identified. For these reasons a claim for 
						declaration of title or an order for injunction must 
						always fail if the plaintiff fails to establish 
						positively the identity of the land to which he claims 
						title . . . . . &#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this case the 
						plaintiff failed to endorse on the Writ of Summons a 
						clear description of the area of land he was claiming. 
						He failed to adduce evidence to show, the measurements 
						of the land he claimed. In one breath, he said he was 
						claiming 0.21 acres as his share of an unidentified 
						land. In another breath he was claiming 0.70 acres. In 
						my view the Court ought to have appointed an independent 
						surveyor for a proper survey of the area in dispute and 
						a plan drawn to scale produced.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Further more the 
						plaintiff led no evidence to prove the boundaries of the 
						land claimed him and failed to call any of his boundary 
						owners. I hold that the plaintiff failed to discharge 
						the burden of proof of the identity of the land claimed. 
						In short he failed to prove his title.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I will next deal with 
						Ground one of the additional grounds of appeal which 
						reads: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;That the trial Court 
						erred in law by failing to appreciate that the plaintiff 
						was not clothed with the requisite capacity to sue and 
						maintain the action, having failed to specify on the 
						writ of summons and statement of claim, whether he was 
						sung as:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(i) Head of the 
						Quarshie family on the authorised representative of the 
						said family by vertue of a power of attorney.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(ii) 
						Executor/Administrator of the estate of ERASMUS AKUETTEH 
						QUARSHIE (deceased) whom he alleged to be the owner of 
						the disputed land in which case he was required to

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The principle of law as 
						enunciated in the case of GHANA MUSLIM REPRESENTATIVE 
						COUNCIL vrs. SALIFU [1975] 2 GLR at 248, is that &quot;In a 
						representative action it was necessary both in the writ, 
						and in the subsequent pleading to state clearly that the 
						parties suing or were being sued in their representative 
						capacity, on behalf of members of the defined were 
						class. The representative capacity should also be stated 
						in the title of both the writ and statement of claim and 
						not merely in the endorsement of the writ or the body of 
						the pleading.&#8221; The record of proceedings reveals that 
						the plaintiff described himself on the writ of summons 
						as &quot;SAMUEL ODOI QUARSHIE SUING ON HIS OWN BEHALF AND THE 
						FAMILY OF QUARSHIE&quot; The plaintiff omitted to state his 
						alleged representative capacity in the statement of 
						claim. He did not disclose the capacity in which he 
						purported to represent the family of Quarshie. He led no 
						evidence on his alleged representative capacity. There 
						was no evidence to suggest that he was either the head 
						of the Quarshie family or authorised by head of family 
						to sue.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is note worthy that 
						in his statement of claim, the plaintiff described the 
						land in dispute. &quot;as family land situate and lying at La 
						near the Degaulle Park&quot; which was &quot;devided into three 
						equal halves&quot; between Akuetteh Quarshie (his father), 
						Oko Yemoh and Yemoteley Quarshie. The plaintiff however 
						led no evidence to show how the family land devolved on 
						the said beneficiaries and became their personal 
						properties. It is evident that the plaintiff was not one 
						of the beneficiaries of the disputed land. And yet he 
						offered no explanation as to why he brought the action.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I hold that having 
						failed to disclose clearly his capacity to sue, the 
						plaintiff's action ought to fail. In the light of the 
						matters convessed above it is my judgment that the 
						plaintiff fail prove his claim and the judgment is 
						hereby set aside. The appeal is allowed and judgment is 
						given in favour of the defendant on her counter claim.</span></p>
