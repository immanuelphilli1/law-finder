												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												WOOD (MRS.), J.A:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The plaintiff respondent sued 
												two persons, the 1st and 2nd 
												Defendants/Appellant for:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a)&nbsp; A declaration of title to a 
												20.6 acre land at Okwenya</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b)&nbsp; general damages for 
												trespass and </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(c)&nbsp; perpetual injunction 
												restraining them from any 
												further tresspassory acts.
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The facts upon which he based 
												his claim are&nbsp; quite simple.&nbsp; He 
												alleged that as far in as 1962, 
												he acquired the subject matter 
												by purchase from the Narh Mati 
												family, and followed it with a 
												formal registration of the title 
												deed in 1990.&nbsp; He claimed that 
												he had remained in effective 
												possession by constructing a 
												swish building on the land, to 
												house his caretaker who had 
												carried out farming activities 
												on the land.&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												He had however been compelled to 
												institute the action in 
												protection of his rights as a 
												result of the various acts of 
												trespasses committed by the two 
												defendants.&nbsp; However, he totally 
												abandoned the action against the 
												1st defendant, ex-husband of the 
												2nd defendant/appellant, and who 
												had left the jurisdiction and is 
												now resident in his home 
												country, Poland.&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Initially, aside from denying 
												all the material facts upon 
												which the claim was founded, 2nd 
												defendant appellant 
												additionally, counterclaimed for 
												similar reliefs.&nbsp; However on 
												16.12.98, she withdrew the 
												counterclaim and contented 
												herself with merely disputing 
												the 1st respondent&#8217;s title. Her 
												version is that she was in 
												occupation of the land as such 
												lawful owner, who had acquired 
												title by purchase from the 
												lawful owners, the Atta Ablah 
												family as far back as 1979 and 
												has thereafter exercised various 
												acts of undisturbed ownership 
												over it, including the 
												construction of the dwelling 
												house she occupies.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On 13.12.95, the Court granted 
												an order for joinder as 
												co-defendant to one Tetteh 
												Quarshie, head of the 2nd 
												defendant/appellants grantor 
												family. A similar application 
												for joinder as co-plaintiff 
												brought by Samuel Degbor who 
												described himself as head of the 
												Degbor family also met with 
												success.&nbsp; Both claimed that they 
												were the lawful grantors of the 
												parties they sought to join.&nbsp; It 
												does appear that the orders were 
												granted principally to enable 
												them litigate over a much larger 
												land, of which the disputed 
												property forms only a small 
												portion.&nbsp; At least, this was the 
												clear stated position of the 
												co-plaintiff respondent in his 
												affidavit accompanying the 
												motion for joinder and also when 
												he moved it.&nbsp; Moreover, the 
												court made no express or even 
												implied order that he was to be 
												limited to prosecuting the 
												original claim, with its limited 
												subject matter. Indeed, such an 
												order would have been plainly 
												incongruous as both grantors, on 
												their own showing, have 
												completely divested themselves 
												of the disputed property and 
												consequently, that none of them 
												have shown either a cause of 
												action or liability as the case 
												may be, as concerns that 
												disputed property.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I believe the same argument goes 
												for the co-defendant respondent, 
												although it would appear from a 
												strict reading of the paragraph 
												7 of his accompanying affidavit 
												that he was limiting himself to 
												the actual subject matter. 
												However, when the affidavit is 
												read as a whole, and that should 
												be the proper approach, the 
												clear understanding is that he 
												was desirous of defending the 
												family&#8217;s large tract of land at 
												Okwenya. Obviously, given their 
												stated positions, the court 
												could not have allowed 
												co-plaintiff to join the action 
												to protect his family&#8217;s vast 
												interest, and yet deny the 
												co-defendant a similar right and 
												limit him to defending only the 
												right of the person he sought to 
												join.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Before I proceed to determine 
												the substantive points raised in 
												this appeal, I would like to 
												address a number of procedural 
												matters. One of them is of minor 
												importance, the others are 
												substantial and grave.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The comparatively minor 
												procedural issue is this. It 
												seems to me that the High Court 
												(Civil Procedure) (Amendment) 
												No. 2 Rules 1977, LI 1129, does 
												not admit the use of the 
												expression &#8220;co-plaintiff&#8221; or 
												'co-defendant&#8217;. The correct 
												nomendature for added parties in 
												my view, is &#8220;plaintiff(s)&#8221; or 
												&#8220;defendant(s)&#8221; as the case may 
												be.&nbsp; I believe what would 
												distinguish such new parties 
												from existing ones would be the 
												numerical prefix.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I would now deal with the more 
												fundamental and I must say more 
												serious procedural matter. Three 
												weeks after the grant of the 
												orders for joinder, the 
												co-plaintiff respondent filed a 
												detailed statement of claim 
												setting out the limits of his 
												family property and claiming 
												against the appellants jointly 
												and severally the following 
												reliefs:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a)&nbsp; Declaration of title to a 
												vast tract of land at Okwenya,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) That co-defendant account 
												and pay for all Dzodze Ohata 
												lands sold to developers,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(c)&nbsp; Recovery of possession,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(d)&nbsp; Perpetual injunction.
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Some seven months later, the 
												co-defendant appellant later 
												filed a defence and made serious 
												allegations of fraud against the 
												respondents. Why it took him 
												that long is difficult to 
												fathom. I must however presume 
												it was regularly filed as no 
												questions about its regularity 
												has been raised at this 
												rehearing.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The co-defendant was the first 
												to apply for the order, followed 
												by the co-appellant with a 
												similar application. Each made a 
												full disclosure of the facts as 
												they knew them, contended that 
												the land as claimed by their 
												respective grantees, the 
												original parties, was only a 
												small portion of their bigger 
												family lands, and further prayed 
												that they be granted the leave 
												to join the action to protect 
												not only the disputed smaller 
												land, but their respective 
												family&#8217;s vast tracts. The court 
												in its wisdom granted both 
												applications and ordered each 
												&#8220;applicant to&#8221; be joined 
												accordingly &#8220;and all processes 
												filed served on them.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Neither we in this court, nor 
												any of the parties have 
												questioned the propriety of the 
												orders of joinder, although the 
												case was fought to conclusion on 
												the&nbsp; basis of the pleadings 
												filed by the two new entrants.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I think the nagging legal issue 
												which deserves our serious 
												consideration is this: Is the 
												co-appellant respondent entitled 
												to relief on the basis of his 
												statement of claim, when the 
												original writ has never been 
												amended to include those 
												specific reliefs stated therein, 
												namely title to the vast land at 
												Okwenya, recovery of possession, 
												order for accounts and damages 
												for trespass?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												An equally fundamental issue is 
												this. It is plain from the 
												record that the respondent on 
												whom the duty lay, did not take 
												any of the mandatory implemental 
												steps set out under Order 15 
												rule 8 of LI.1129 essential to 
												giving effect to the order of 
												joinder.&nbsp; In effect then both 
												co-plaintiff respondent and 
												co-defendant appellant were not 
												parties in the proceedings.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Order 15 rule 8 stipulates:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Where an order is made under 
												rule 6, the writ by which the 
												action was began must be amended 
												accordingly and endorsed with:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a)&nbsp; reference to the order in 
												pursuance of which the amendment 
												is made, and</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) the date on which the 
												amendment is made and the 
												amendment must be made within 
												such period as may be specified 
												in the order, if no period is so 
												specified, within 14 days after 
												the making of the order </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2.&nbsp; where under the rule 6 a 
												person is ordered to be made a 
												defendant, the rules as to 
												service of a writ of summons 
												shall apply to service of the 
												amended writ on him, but before 
												serving the writ on him the 
												person on whose application the 
												order was made must procure the 
												order to be noted in the cause 
												book</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3. a person ordered under rule 6 
												to be added as a party shall not 
												become a party until the writ 
												has been amended in relation to 
												him under this rule and if (he 
												is a defendant) has been served 
												on him&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The rule 8(1) &amp; (2) spells out 
												the mandatory implemental steps 
												that must be taken on the grant 
												of the order for joinder.&nbsp; Sub 
												rule (3) deals with the 
												consequences that flow from 
												non-compliance with the rules 
												(1) &amp; (2).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												They are quite drastic. A plain 
												reading of the rules shows that 
												in the event of non-compliance, 
												the successful applicant does 
												not become a party to the 
												pending action.&nbsp; In effect then, 
												the order for joinder or the 
												process becomes ipso facto 
												void.&nbsp; It is very much like that 
												which flows from a failure to 
												amend under Order 28 rules 7-10 
												of the High Court rules. </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The necessary implemental steps 
												to be taken under rules 8 are 
												quite straightforward and has 
												been spelt out by my brother 
												Benin J, as he then was in Ganda 
												v. Ganda (1989-90) 2 GLR 58 at 
												60. He reiterated that</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;It provides for (i) amendment 
												of the writ, in the title of the 
												continuing action; (ii) the 
												service of the amended writ on 
												any added defendant (iii) the 
												appearance of any added 
												defendant&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On a strict application of the 
												rules therefore, there would be 
												no co-plaintiff nor co-defendant 
												before us and the co-plaintiff's 
												action can be dismissed on this 
												procedural technicality alone.&nbsp; 
												But then, the periods stipulated 
												under the rules are all capable 
												of being extended. The trial 
												court failed to draw the guilty 
												parties, particularly the two 
												respondents&#8217; attention to the 
												procedural invalidities existing 
												in the proceedings and allowed 
												the trial to proceed to 
												completion on the basis of the 
												pleadings filed and on the 
												erroneous assumption that they 
												were indeed effectively parties. 
												In the regard, no one side was 
												prejudiced, embarrassed 
												surprised nor suffered any 
												miscarriage of justice.&nbsp; I think 
												substantial injustice would be 
												done to both sides if I set the 
												trial, particularly between the 
												added parties aside, on the 
												grounds of nullity, having 
												regard among other things to the 
												fact that the case itself, from 
												trial to the appellate court has 
												take 8 long years.&nbsp; I would 
												therefore take the rare step 
												taken by my brothers in the case 
												of Kwarteng II v. Klu (1991) 2 
												GLR 93 at 97 when they found 
												themselves caught with some what 
												similar circumstances.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Although the facts are not in 
												any way similar, the problem 
												which faced them at the appeal 
												hearing is the same as that 
												which confronts us now. Up to 
												the date of the hearing of the 
												appeal, no amended statement of 
												defence had been filed by the 
												successful defendant who had 
												been granted leave in the court 
												below to amend his statement of 
												defence. Consequently, at the 
												date of the appeal, the order 
												had become ipso facto void.&nbsp; The 
												court however granted an 
												extention of time, even at that 
												late stage, being satisfied that 
												it would not occasion any 
												substantial miscarriage of 
												justice to the opposing side, 
												thus lending further weight to 
												the principle that extention of 
												time within which to carry out 
												certain orders of the court e.g. 
												amendments and even an 
												application for the amendment 
												itself, may be granted as late 
												as at appeal stage, if on the 
												facts no embarrassment, 
												prejudice, surprise, in short, 
												no substantial miscarriage of 
												justice would be occasioned 
												thereby.&nbsp; In order that this 
												case would be adjudged on the 
												merits, I would grant the 
												respondent the same dispensation 
												and extend time for 7 days from 
												this date, for the rule&nbsp; 8 to be 
												complied with. On the peculiar 
												facts of this case, no 
												miscarriage of justice, let 
												alone a substantial one would be 
												caused to either side. It would 
												on the other hand save the 
												parties untold hardship. I must 
												point out however that this 
												favour would not per se, alter 
												the legal consequences of the 
												unamended writ of summon viz a 
												viz the co-plaintiffs intended 
												reliefs, and I would have to 
												decide on that issue also.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The undoubtedly salutary 
												principle of law is that, this 
												court has power in deserving 
												cases to effect an amendment in 
												order to achieve real justice 
												between the parties by 
												determining all the matters in 
												controversy,&nbsp; avoiding a 
												multiplicity of litigation.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Since this case was fought on 
												the basis of the co-plaintiff 
												respondents pleadings, we should 
												over come this legal and 
												technical difficulty, by 
												amending the writ of summons to 
												reflect the reliefs specified in 
												his statement of claim. The 
												clerk of this court is to effect 
												the necessary amendment 
												forthwith.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What therefore started off as a 
												simple dispute between two 
												individuals ended up as a major 
												battle between the two families.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In his judgment, the learned 
												trial judge chose to limit 
												himself to what he described as 
												the claims of the co-parties. 
												&nbsp;He reasoned that: </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;With the entry of the 
												co-plaintiff and the 
												co-defendant, the interests of 
												the plaintiff were submerged. It 
												will therefore serve no useful 
												purpose to dilate on evidence of 
												the plaintiff and the defendant 
												because in the event that either 
												of them won the victory can be 
												passed on to either of them 
												whichever way the judgment 
												goes&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Accordingly, judgment was given 
												in favour of the co-plaintiff 
												respondent for the reliefs 
												pleaded in the statement of 
												claim, and the plaintiff 
												respondent, the initiator of the 
												action who had sued for damages 
												for trespass and perpetual 
												injunction against the defendant 
												appellant got absolutely 
												nothing. Clearly dissatisfied 
												with this decision, appellants 
												have appealed to us on a number 
												of grounds including the 
												oft-used omnibus ground&#8212;the 
												judgment is against the weight 
												of evidence.&nbsp; The other grounds, 
												which from the written 
												submissions, were all argued 
												together are that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												1.&nbsp; &#8220;The plaintiff/respondent 
												lacked the requisite title to 
												sue or commence action against 
												the defendant/appellant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2.&nbsp; The co-plaintiff respondent 
												did not have the requisite 
												capacity to sue and or join the 
												action.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3.&nbsp; The learned judge failed to 
												determine which family was 
												represented in the suit herein 
												by the co-plaintiff respondent.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												4.&nbsp; The learned judge failed to 
												make a correct approach to the 
												evidence led by the parties.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												5.&nbsp; The learned judge failed to 
												take a correct view of the 
												evidential (sic) value of 
												Exhibit A relied on by the 
												plaintiff respondent </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												6.&nbsp; The learned judge failed to 
												make a proper evaluation of the 
												two judgments relied upon by the 
												co-defendant/respondent together 
												with such evidence as Jackson&#8217;s 
												report and Exh. R1 as well as 
												the District Report on Akuse 
												lands. Non of the distinctly 
												specific grounds was argued 
												separately.&nbsp; All the various 
												grounds were tackled as if only 
												the one omnibus ground was 
												filed.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The argument may be summed up as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												First, that to succeed the 
												co-plaintiff respondent ought to 
												have proved that he had both the 
												capacity to institute the action 
												and also valid title to convey 
												to the respondent. It was 
												submitted that on the evidence, 
												he failed to discharge this 
												burden and consequently, none of 
												them was entitled to relief.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Second, it was submitted that in 
												any event, since the 
												co-appellant respondent 
												contradicted himself on such 
												critical issues like his 
												lineage, the exact location of 
												the land he claimed, and its 
												exact boundaries, he was not 
												entitled to judgment.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The third criticism levelled 
												against the trial judge was that 
												he failed to apply the correct 
												legal principles in determing 
												the issues before him.&nbsp; The 
												lament was that he wrongly 
												rejected a document tendered by 
												the co-defendant appellant even 
												though it formed part of family 
												history and was clearly 
												therefore protected by and 
												admissible under S.128 of the 
												Evidence Decree, NRCD 323.&nbsp; 
												Furthermore, it was submitted 
												that he ignored all the salutary 
												principles governing the 
												evaluation of traditional 
												history, thereby leading to the 
												wrong conclusion that the 
												traditional evidence they led 
												was cogent enough to warrant 
												judgment in their favour for all 
												the reliefs sought.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The plaintiff respondent, being 
												quite content with the 
												criticized decision, did not 
												appeal. Perhaps this arose from 
												the trial judge&#8217;s opinion that 
												with the &#8220;two joinders, the case 
												of the plaintiff and defendant 
												have become subjected to the 
												wider interest of the 
												co-plaintiff and the 
												co-defendant and whatsoever 
												judgment is given can rectify 
												whatsoever lapses there are in 
												the conveyance made to their 
												respective beneficiaries.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Not that plaintiff ought to have 
												filed a cross appeal, for under 
												the rule 15 of the Court of 
												Appeal Rules 1997, CI.19, he 
												need not take any such step if 
												he was bent on asking for a 
												variation of the appealed 
												decision.&nbsp; Indeed, under the 
												rules, where an appeal has 
												already been lodged by one 
												dissatisfied party, the 
												prescribed mode for calling for 
												a variation of any part of the 
												criticized decision, by some 
												other equally aggrieved 
												respondent, is spelt out in the 
												clearly self explanatory rule, 
												which is reproduced hereunder.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;15 Notice by respondent of 
												contention that judgment should 
												be varied.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(i) It shall not be necessary 
												for the respondent to file 
												notice by way of cross appeal, 
												but if the respondent intends 
												upon the hearing of the appeal 
												to contend that the decision of 
												the court below should be 
												varied, he shall within one 
												month after service upon him of 
												the notice of appeal, cause 
												written notice as in form 7 in 
												part 1 of the schedule of his 
												intention to be given to every 
												party who may be affected by the 
												contention.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&nbsp;He has not taken advantage of 
												this rule. Of course, he is 
												under no compulsion to do so. 
												But given the peculiar facts 
												surrounding the prosecution of 
												this case, one would have 
												thought this was a most prudent 
												course to take, so that in the 
												event that the co-plaintiff 
												respondent for some reason lost 
												this appeal, he might not be 
												left without remedy.&nbsp; After all, 
												he initiated this action in the 
												first place. He is not only a 
												separate and distinct legal 
												person, but as a plaintiff he 
												has put in his own separate and 
												distinct claims against a 
												clearly identified alleged 
												tortfeasor.&nbsp; He is therefore 
												entitled to show by legal 
												evidence a cause of action and 
												liability against that person, 
												who is defendant appellant.&nbsp; 
												Indeed that is what he sought to 
												prove by his own evidence and 
												that of his witness, for which 
												reasons, alone, his case was 
												deserving of a separate 
												treatment, irrespective of his 
												grantors claim to the larger 
												tract of land.&nbsp; Quite clearly he 
												was, in his own right, in search 
												particularly, of the order of 
												perpetual injunction against the 
												defendant appellant, her privies 
												and assigns as an effective 
												means of checking future 
												threats.&nbsp; It was therefore 
												entirely wrong for the trial 
												judge to have left his rights 
												unadjudicated.&nbsp; Be that as it 
												may, he is afforded sufficient 
												protection under the rules, 
												which can take care of any 
												eventualities.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Under rule 32 of CI.19, this 
												court has power &#8220;to give any 
												judgment and make any order that 
												ought to have been made, and to 
												make such further order as the 
												case may require including any 
												order as to costs&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Furthermore, these wide 
												discretionary powers are 
												exercisable &#8220;notwithstanding 
												that the appellant may have 
												asked that part only of a 
												decision be reversed or varied, 
												and may also be exercised in 
												favour of all or any of the 
												respondents or parties although 
												the respondents or parties may 
												not have appealed from or 
												complained of the decision.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I now turn my attention to the 
												merits of the case.&nbsp; In this 
												regard, I think it would be 
												expedient to deal with the 
												co-plaintiffs respondents case 
												first as the plaintiff 
												respondent derives title from 
												him.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As claimant of that &#8216;very large 
												tract of land lying at Okwenya, 
												one of his primary duties has 
												been spelt out in the case of 
												Nyikplokor v. Agboder 
												(1987-1988) GLR 165 at 171.&nbsp; 
												This court, speaking unanimously 
												through Abban JA as he then was, 
												and who is now of blessed 
												memory, outlined that duty as 
												follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220; To succeed in an action for a 
												declaration of title to land, 
												recovery of possession and for 
												an injunction the plaintiff must 
												establish by position evidence 
												the identity and limits of the 
												land which he claims&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The manner in which this 
												uncompromising stand of the law 
												translates into practical terms, 
												is by calling boundary owners or 
												neighbours as witnesses. The 
												calling of boundary owners is so 
												crucial that &#8220;the failure to 
												prove boundaries even of only 
												one side was fatal and the fact 
												that the defendant had 
												counterclaimed did not lessen 
												that burden&#8221;, per Francois JSC 
												in Akoto II v. Kavege 
												(1984-1986) 2 GLR 361 at 371.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In his statement of claim, the 
												co-plaintiff described the 
												disputed land as being at 
												Okwenya.&nbsp; It appears that was a 
												vague description.&nbsp; From his 
												evidence in chief, his family 
												land, which forms only a part of 
												the Okwenya lands, lies 
												specifically at Ladornya.&nbsp; 
												Indeed other evidence he 
												supplied at the trial confirms 
												the position that the disputed 
												land lies at Ladornya.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												However, the wrong or vague 
												naming of the land, or the 
												failure to specifically name it, 
												is to my mind wholly immaterial 
												and does not damage his cause, 
												since Ladornya still forms part 
												of Okwenya.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The more critical issue is this: 
												Did he succeed in proving the 
												identity of the Ladornya land 
												i.e. the disputed land? The duty 
												to prove strictly the identity 
												of the subject matter is 
												crucial, given also that one of 
												his own witnesses Pw2, has 
												distanced himself from Exh. C, a 
												plan he tendered at the trial, 
												ostensibly to prove the identity 
												of the land.&nbsp; The Pw2 was 
												emphatic that at a landowners 
												meeting held in 1976, at which 
												he was present and at which 
												meeting the various families who 
												owned land at Manya laid claim 
												to and identified their lands, 
												the meeting did not discuss any 
												plan.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In any event, the position of 
												the law is clear.&nbsp; The mere 
												tendering of a survey plan, 
												which clearly delineates the 
												boundaries, would not relieve 
												him of the required proof of his 
												boundaries.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The description of his 
												boundaries as per his statement 
												of claim were as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Krobo Mountain, the River 
												Okwe, Susui people land and 
												finally Asafoatse Narh Mati 
												family land.&nbsp;&nbsp; His evidence in 
												chief however clearly saw him 
												departing from the pleadings 
												regarding one side of the 
												boundaries. He testified that 
												one side shares boundary with&nbsp; 
												&#8220;the people of Nagmane.&#8221; No 
												evidence was led to suggest that 
												Nagmane is the same as Susui.&nbsp; 
												Aside from this marked, and 
												therefore material discrepancy 
												in the co-plaintiff respondent&#8217;s 
												own evidence and pleadings, I 
												find that he was unable to prove 
												the identity of the disputed 
												land.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												First, he failed to produce two 
												important boundary owners, the 
												Asafoatse Namati family and the 
												Nagmane people.&nbsp; On his own 
												showing, he shares boundaries 
												with them.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The evidence of the Pw1, the 
												fetish priest of the Krowerki 
												shrine, did little to bolster 
												his case.&nbsp; From his testimony, 
												Okwenya land belongs to his 
												fetish and the whole Manya 
												people. The Manya people are 
												made up of several clans and 
												families.&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												He offered no evidence on who 
												owned Ladornya the disputed 
												land.&nbsp; This extract from his own 
												evidence show that he knows next 
												to nothing about who either owns 
												the disputed land or who the 
												neighbouring boundary owners 
												are.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Q.&nbsp; After the Manya people who 
												has land on the left.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A.&nbsp; That is left for the Manya 
												people</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Q. So you know only about your 
												land and you do not know 
												anything about any other land</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A. That is correct.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Q. I am suggesting to you that 
												you do not know the real owner 
												of the land in dispute</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A.&nbsp; I know the land belong to 
												the Manya people.&#8221; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Second, the Pw2&#8217;s testimony 
												conflicted materially with other 
												evidence led at the trial on two 
												critical issues&#8212; the issue of 
												who owned the disputed land and 
												the question of who owned the 
												Krobo Mountain, a very important 
												physical feature that 
												co-plaintiff respondent 
												maintains serves as a boundary 
												mark.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Claiming that he had lived in 
												Okwenya for 60 years, and 
												further that he is not a mere 
												settler, but one who knows the 
												true owners of the land he 
												deposed to the following:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220; I know the location of the 
												land in dispute between the 
												parties. The land belongs to 
												Namati. I am aware that there 
												was a dispute between Namati and 
												the Konor. That litigation gave 
												the land to Namati.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Namati family has been described 
												by the co-plaintiff respondent 
												as a boundary neighbours. Pw3 
												created a further dent in the 
												co-plaintiffs case by his flat 
												denial that Okwe stream (another 
												of co-plaintiffs boundaries) is 
												a boundary mark, let alone an 
												important one.&nbsp; I reproduce the 
												relevant portion of his 
												testimony on that issue.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Q.&nbsp; Do you know that the Okwe 
												is a very important boundary 
												mark in the area?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A.&nbsp; The stream is not a boundary 
												mark.&nbsp; The stream passes through 
												the land&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This answer clearly discredits 
												the co-plaintiffs claim that the 
												river serves as one of his 
												family land's boundaries.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the critical issue of who 
												owns the Krobo Mountain I have 
												presented the two conflicting 
												accounts which were produced by 
												the co-plaintiff's own witnesses 
												Pw2 testified as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The Degbe lands stretches from 
												the Krobo mountain downwards, 
												the first who owned it was Dodze 
												Okata, after him Akronatebi.&nbsp; 
												After him Akromoase Nartey Degbe 
												hails from the family.&nbsp; The land 
												stretches from the Krobo 
												mountain to the Okwe stream.&nbsp; 
												The co-plaintiff is the current 
												Head of Family of Dzodze Okate&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In contrast to the above, the

												&nbsp;&#8220; I am now at Okwenya for 60 
												years. &#8230;&nbsp; By our Ewe Tradition, 
												when you want to farm on 
												somebody&#8217;s land, you need to 
												seek the permission of the 
												owner. We acquired our land from 
												the Manya people. The Manya 
												people showed us the boundaries 
												of the land so that we do not 
												enter into other people land &#8230;. 
												The land of the Manya people 
												started at the top of the 
												mountain.&nbsp; The Susui people also 
												belong to the Manya Division.&nbsp; I 
												am referring to the Krobo 
												Mountain.&nbsp; All the land down the 
												Krobo mountain belong to the 
												Manya and Susui people. The 
												Manya/Susui land lies as the 
												bush:&#8212; Kenglesi, Agric farm 
												Asotsokake, Morsorder, 
												Kroku/Akromateder, Mueyoko, 
												Okumi&nbsp; Saleso, and the universal 
												college.&nbsp; I know the stream 
												called Lador.&nbsp; It is on the way 
												to Akuse the owner of the land 
												on which we have lader is owned 
												by Francis Otoo and Asafoatse Na 
												Nmati. &#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Therefore, while Pw3 maintained

												the Pw3 swore that it is owned 
												by the Manya and Susui people.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The situation I have is this.&nbsp; 
												We have a claimant who admitted 
												per his statement of claim that 
												this opponent is in possession 
												and has indeed exercised various 
												acts of ownership over the land 
												in dispute i.e. by the sale of 
												portions of the land to a number 
												of individuals.&nbsp; This explains 
												his prayer for the reliefs of 
												recovery of possession and order 
												of accounts.&nbsp; The unyielding 
												position of the law in such land 
												disputes is that the claimant 
												succeeds on the strength of his 
												own case and does not rely on 
												any weaknesses in his opponent&#8217;s 
												case as proof of his title.&nbsp; 
												Duagbor v. Akyea Djamson 
												(1984-1986) 697 reiterated this 
												well-known rule of law so 
												clearly it does not admit of any 
												exceptions.&nbsp; In the words of 
												Abban JA, as he then was:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220; Co-defendants counterclaim 
												could not in any way lighten the 
												weight of the burden on the 
												Plaintiff to establish his title 
												by preponderance of admissible 
												evidence. The defence having 
												demand the plaintiffs&#8217; title and 
												then counterclaimed for title, a 
												burden was placed on the 
												plaintiff to prove his title 
												satisfactorily or else he must 
												fail&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The co-plaintiff respondent 
												failed to lead satisfactory 
												evidence in proof of the 
												identity of the disputed land. 
												He failed to establish or call 
												the adjoining landowners he had 
												mentioned to establish the 
												boundaries see Beggio v. Ahebo 
												(1983-83) GLR 1171. Not only 
												that, but his own witness 
												maintained unequivocally that 
												the subject matter belonged to 
												Narh Mati family.&nbsp; In other 
												words it did not belong to his 
												family.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												These facts are sufficiently 
												strong enough to destroy his own 
												case and I do not think any 
												historical or other traditional 
												evidence, be they in song, dance 
												or what ever can salvage his 
												case.&nbsp; In my view even if he had 
												the capacity to sue, he was not 
												entitled to judgment and his 
												claim in respect of the disputed 
												land ought to have been 
												dismissed.</span></p>

												The plaintiff&#8217;s case </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As claimant, to succeed in

												case.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The well-known rule of law is 
												that &#8220;where a party derived his 
												title to land from someone else, 
												either by way of gift or 
												purchase or other form of 
												alienation of land, it was 
												incumbent upon that party whose

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In other words, where his title 
												is put in issue, to succeed, the 
												claimant must prove his root of 
												title.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The plaintiff respondents 
												grantor, who joined the action 
												to defend his family&#8217;s alleged 
												bigger interest in a very large 
												tract of land of which 
												plaintiffs own landforms only a 
												very small portion failed 
												woefully to prove his title. On 
												that ground alone, the plaintiff 
												respondent had no legs to stand 
												on and his case must fail.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												However, his case itself bore 
												its own patent weaknesses. I 
												think these must be pointed out. 
												In the end, he also like his 
												grantor failed to establish a 
												good case.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												First, his own evidence on the 
												mode of acquisition of the 
												disputed land conflicted with 
												the evidence of his grantor.&nbsp; He 
												spoke of a purchase, his grantor 
												was most emphatic that the 
												transaction was a gift and not a 
												sale.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Second, his version on the date 
												of acquisition itself was most 
												doubtful. It failed to meet the 
												reasonable probability test. He 
												would have us believe that he 
												first acquired the property in 
												1962. At that date he was only a 
												14-year-old schoolboy.&nbsp; His 
												grantor who gave his approximate 
												age as at the date of giving 
												evidence as 65 years, was then 
												only some 29 years old.&nbsp; He was 
												then not the head of family.&nbsp; 
												How a young man of his age could 
												sell or gift such a big tract of 
												family land to a school boy non 
												member of the family is itself 
												something altogether. Even more 
												importantly, his grantor himself 
												confessed that he assumed the 
												headship of the family in 1983.&nbsp; 
												So how could he have validly 
												sold or gifted it and in 1962?&nbsp; 
												Other unanswered question were 
												how much the 14 years old school 
												boy paid for the property. In 
												the end, I found the story that 
												he purchased the land in 1962 
												preposterous.&nbsp; The mere probable 
												story the alleged is acquisition 
												evidenced by the Exh. A of 
												1990.&nbsp; By which date the 
												defendant appellant was already 
												in possession.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Third, the grantors evidence of 
												the family to which he belongs 
												to is totally at variance with 
												the plaintiff respondent&#8217;s 
												version as pleaded. From his 
												account his grantor belongs to, 
												(and so does the land) the Narh 
												Mati family.&nbsp; The grantor 
												himself states that he is the 
												head of the Dzodze Okata family, 
												owners of the disputed land.&nbsp; 
												This throws further doubt on his 
												already weak case on the 
												question of which family owns 
												the land and so had capacity to 
												convey a valid title.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Finally, the evidence of the 
												court appointed surveyor dealt 
												the final death knell to the 
												plaintiff respondents&#8217; case.&nbsp; He 
												confessed to the following:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) the plaintiff's land as 
												evidenced by the site plan was 
												different from what was shown 
												physically on the ground,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) The plotting was irregular,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3) A small portion of his land 
												fell within land already 
												acquired by the defendants,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(4) Contrary to the plaintiff&#8217;s 
												assertion he did not find any 
												thatched building (belonging to 
												him) on the disputed property,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(5) The defendant appellant has 
												built a first class cement block 
												building on the disputed land</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the whole the plaintiffs case 
												was weak, unreliable and 
												unsatisfactory and cannot earn 
												him any of the reliefs claimed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Asare v. Appau II 1984-1986 1 
												GLR 600 lays down the governing 
												rules in those cases where a 
												claimant sues to assert title 
												and recover possession from a 
												defendant in possession.&nbsp; This 
												court per Amuah Sakyi JA as he 
												then was, stated the applicable 
												rule as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Such a defendant need not, and 
												usually does not seek any relief 
												in the proceedings being, 
												content with things as they are 
												&#8230; In that event the plaintiff 
												must rely on the strength of his 
												own case i.e. prove his title 
												and not rely on the weakness of 
												his opponents case, i.e. lack of 
												title in the defendant so that 
												if the plaintiff fails to prove 
												that he is entitled to have a 
												declaration made of his title to 
												the land, the action ought to be 
												dismissed leaving the defendant 
												in possession of the land&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">

												counterclaim.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the result the plaintiff

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The facts relied upon by the 
												plaintiff to mount his action 
												are briefly that the plaintiff 
												is a businessman and chief 
												executive officer of Trans 
												Africa (2000) Ltd. Plaintiff 
												resides mostly in London but 
												shuttles between that city and 
												Accra and other parts of the 
												world to attend to his business. 
												The defendant on the other hand 
												is an international airline 
												company with an office in Accra. 
												The plaintiff travelled by a 
												business class ticket from 
												London to Accra aboard the 
												defendant's airline. On 15th 
												July 2002, plaintiff reported at 
												Kotoka International Airport to 
												embark on his return journey to 
												London. At 7:30 pm on that 
												15/7/2002 plaintiff proceeded to 
												the defendant's check in 
												counter, where the defendant's 
												staff, a lady, asked him 
												(plaintiff) to place his luggage 
												on the weighing scale to which 
												he complied. The defendant's 
												staff upon looking at the scale 
												said the plaintiff had excess 
												baggage. The plaintiff said he 
												responded by telling the 
												defendant's staff that she 
												should have first observed his 
												class of ticket before saying he 
												had excess baggage. As a result, 
												the defendant's staff requested 
												for the ticket and after 
												examining it, told the plaintiff 
												that his ticket was not valid. 
												This prompted the plaintiff to 
												point out that he had travelled 
												from London by the same ticket 
												and being an open ticket he was 
												now using the out bound to fly 
												back to London and that he 
												confirmed his flight from 
												defendant's partnership hotel 
												(Golden Tulip). The defendant's 
												staff, apparently infuriated by 
												the plaintiff's explanations 
												responded that the plaintiff 
												should not tell her how to do 
												her job and that the ticket was 
												not valid, thereby triggering 
												some arguments. According to the 
												plaintiff, in the course of the 
												arguments he told the 
												defendant's staff that he had a 
												business meeting the following 
												day the 16th July 2002 and must 
												be allowed to board the aircraft 
												to London and then to proceed to 
												Brussels. To this, the 
												defendant's staff sarcastically 
												responded that even if the 
												plaintiff were going to visit 
												the Queen of England, he would 
												not be allowed to fly with the 
												defendant's aircraft since his 
												air ticket was not valid. The 
												staff also told the plaintiff 
												that even though there were 
												vacant seats on the aircraft 
												they would not allow him to 
												board. Meanwhile other 
												passengers, mainly whites, who 
												came after the plaintiff to the 
												defendant's counter were 
												processed and made to board the 
												aircraft. The plaintiff remained 
												at the defendant's counter till 
												the close of the flight 
												whereupon plaintiff left for the 
												La Palm Beach Hotel where he 
												lodged for the night.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The following day, plaintiff 
												sent the General Manager of his 
												company, PWI, to the defendant's 
												main office to ascertain the 
												validity of his KLM business 
												class ticket to be told that not 
												only was the ticket valid but 
												that plaintiff should proceed to 
												the airport that same 16th July 
												2002 to board the plane with the 
												same ticket. The plaintiff 
												accordingly flew to London but 
												was not able to attend the 
												meeting on 16th July 2002 due to 
												the events of the previous 
												evening. This according to 
												plaintiff resulted in his loss 
												of the contract.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">

												by the judgment filed an appeal 
												against the whole judgment on 
												the following grounds namely:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) That the learned trial Judge 
												erred in law by 
												allowing/permitting 
												unauthenticated and uncertified 
												self serving letters and 
												documents of the plaintiff to be 
												admitted in evidence 
												notwithstanding objections by 
												the Defendant's counsel to same 
												or by the court on its own 
												motion as per Section 8 of the 
												Evidence Decree 1975 (NRCD 323)</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) That the learned trial judge 
												erred in law by awarding damages 
												to the plaintiff when pleadings 
												and evidence clearly indicate 
												that the plaintiff could not and 
												did not provide specific and 
												sufficient evidence to establish 
												a legal obligation created by 
												mutual agreement between the 
												plaintiff and the defendant that 
												mandated the defendant to fly 
												the plaintiff to a destination 
												in Brussels to allegedly bid for 
												a contract on or before 16th 
												July 2002.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(c) That the learned trial judge 
												also erred in law by finding 
												that, the defendant was in 
												breach of contract and awarding 
												excessive damage and costs to 
												the plaintiff as, even if, the 
												defendant breached its contract 
												with the plaintiff, said heavy 
												damages cannot reasonably be 
												supposed to have been in the 
												contemplation of both plaintiff 
												and defendant at the time of 
												purchase of defendant's airline 
												ticket by the plaintiff.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(d) That the learned trial judge 
												erred by giving judgment in 
												favour of plaintiff when his 
												pleadings and evidence adduced 
												at the trial clearly indicated 
												that he has completely and 
												totally failed to discharge or 
												meet the burden of producing 
												credible evidence on the issue 
												before the court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(e) That the judgment of the 
												learned trial Judge is against 
												the weight of evidence adduced 
												at the trial.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(f) That further and other 
												grounds of appeal may be filed 
												on receipt of a certified copy 
												of the judgment or ruling.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Arguing the first ground of his 
												appeal, the appellant submitted 
												in the statement of case that 
												certain unauthenticated, 
												uncertified and notarized 
												documents were admitted in 
												evidence despite strenuous 
												objections by counsel. As to 
												what specific documents are 
												referred to, counsel for the 
												appellant has, in the main, not 
												been helpful to the court on the 
												issue. Counsel failed to point 
												to the particular documents that 
												were affected by the trial 
												judge's generous reception into 
												evidence. For instance, the 
												reference in the statement of 
												case to page 27 line 20 is not a 
												reference to a particular 
												document whose reception is 
												being questioned nor is the 
												reference to page 31 paragraph 
												12 a reference to an exhibit 
												that ought not to have been 
												accepted in evidence. I believe 
												that the reference to page 31 
												paragraph 12 ought to be a 
												reference to line 12 since the 
												appeal record is read according 
												to the lines and not paragraphs. 
												Thus said, page 31 line 12, does 
												not help the cause mounted by 
												the appellant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The closest to the point is 
												perhaps appellant's reference to 
												other instances of admissions by 
												the Judge on pages 33 to 35 and 
												44 of the record of appeal. The 
												exhibits covered on those paces 
												are exhibits E, F and perhaps G, 
												the exhibit G being admitted on 
												page 45. The plaintiff tendered 
												exhibits A, B, C, D, E and F, 
												ostensibly in proof of his 
												assertion that his status as a 
												prominent business man was 
												recognized by the Sierra Leone, 
												Ghana and British governments as 
												well as by the West Africa 
												magazine respectively. Exhibit A 
												is a letter-purportedly written 
												by the Inspector General of 
												Police of Sierra Leone. Exhibit 
												B is a photocopy of a letter 
												from a 'Commission for the 
												Consolidation of Peace (Sierra 
												Leone Government)' appointing 
												the plaintiff as its Ambassador 
												at Large. Exhibit C is another 
												letter signed by a Chairman 
												'Sammy Doppelt' on a letterhead 
												of Independent Diamond Valuators 
												to the plaintiff to facilitate 
												an invitation to the President 
												of Ghana and his Minister for 
												Mineral affairs to attend a 
												conference. Exhibit D is an 
												unsigned letter bearing the name 
												'SAMY DOPPELT' Chairman, 
												inviting the President of Ghana 
												to an undated meeting with Al 
												Gore former Vice President in 
												attendance. Exhibit E is a 
												photocopy, albeit faxed copy, of 
												a letter from 10 Downing Street 
												to the plaintiff. Finally 
												Exhibit F is a copy of West 
												Africa magazine issue No 4293. 
												As to whether the reception of 
												any of these exhibits in 
												evidence was proper, the same 
												can only be answered by 
												considering whether their 
												reception complied with the 
												provisions of the Evidence 
												Decree.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Since exhibits A, B, C, D and E 
												purport to be documents or 
												copies thereof of foreign 
												official bodies, their admission 
												must be regulated by section 161 
												of NRCD 323. Consequently the 
												said exhibits being foreign 
												official documents should be 
												accompanied by certifications 
												attesting to the Genuineness of 
												the signatures and the official 
												positions of the persons who 
												executed the writings in order 
												for them to be presumed genuine 
												and authorized. These 
												certifications must be signed 
												and sealed by a diplomatic agent 
												of Ghana or of a Commonwealth 
												Country who is assigned or 
												accredited to that country.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Needless to say that in these 
												days of phenomenal advancement 
												in science and technology, the 
												quest to guard against frauds 
												generally by strict adherence to 
												these rules cannot be over 
												emphasized. For this reason no 
												value could be placed on the 
												contents of Exhibit A, B, C, D 
												and E. Rule 8 of NRCD 323 
												empowers this court to exclude, 
												on its own motion, evidence that 
												would be inadmissible if 
												objected to by a party. Exhibits 
												A, E, C, D and E qualify to be 
												so treated and I hereby exclude 
												them from the record. As for 
												Exhibit F, being a periodical, 
												its reception is governed by 
												rule 156 of the Evidence Decree, 
												which makes for its reception as 
												applied by the trial court. Its 
												reception was therefore proper 
												under the circumstance. Reading 
												through the judgment of 17th 
												June 2003 however, I find 
												nothing to suggest that the 
												trial judge placed any reliance 
												on any of the documents just 
												discussed. The judgment was 
												rather informed by legal 
												evidence only for which I cannot 
												fault the judge. In the premises 
												I find no merit in this ground 
												of appeal and dismiss it.</span></p>

												The next two grounds together 
												attack the trial judge's award 
												of damages and excessive costs 
												in favour of the plaintiff 
												particularly when the pleadings 
												and evidence clearly indicate 
												that the plaintiff could not and 
												did not provide specific and 
												sufficient evidence establishing 
												a legal obligation created by 
												mutual agreement between 
												plaintiff and defendant that 
												mandated defendant to fly 
												plaintiff to Brussels to bid for 
												a contract on or before 16th 
												July 2002. In determining these 
												grounds together under the 
												rubric of the omnibus ground 
												that the judgment is against the 
												weight of evidence let me begin 
												by making an observation as to 
												what I consider to be the 
												essence of these grounds of 
												appeal. The crux as I see it, is 
												whether the plaintiff had proved 
												in accordance with S. 15(2) of 
												the Evidence Decree, (NRCD 323), 
												that the defendant was the cause 
												of his alleged loss of contract 
												in Brussels so as to warrant the 
												award of the damages and costs 
												granted by the court. Section 15 
												(2) of NRCD 323 states that, 
												&quot;Unless and until it is shifted, 
												the party claiming that a person 
												did not exercise a requisite 
												degree of care has the burden on 
												that issue.&quot; The case of Hadley 
												vs. Baxendale (1854) 9 Exch.341 
												@354 blazed-the trail for the 
												award of damages wherein 
												Alderson B stated that, &quot;Were 
												two parties have made a contract 
												which one of them has broken, 
												the damages which the other 
												party ought to receive in 
												respect of such breach of 
												contract should be such as may 
												fairly and reasonably be 
												considered either arising 
												naturally i.e. according to the 
												usual course of things, from 
												such breach of contract itself 
												or such as may reasonably be 
												supposed to have been in the 
												contemplation of both parties, 
												at the time they made the 
												contract, as the probable result 
												of the breach of it &quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The defendant is here, not 
												contesting the trial judge's 
												finding that, 'In short 
												therefore, the defendant 
												deliberately and unjustifiably 
												prevented the plaintiff from 
												undertaking his journey aboard 
												their flight on 15th July 2002.' 
												The defendant's concern as can 
												be discerned from the record is 
												that there was no mutual 
												agreement between him 
												(defendant) and plaintiff, 
												mandating defendant to fly 
												plaintiff to Brussels to bid for 
												a contract on or before 16th 
												July 2002. In other words the 
												defendant is here contending 
												that Brussels was not within the 
												contemplation of either party at 
												the time the two of them entered 
												into the contract of carriage. 
												The ticket exhibit M provides 
												for carriage from 'London to 
												Amsterdam to Accra to Amsterdam 
												to London'. The defendant's 
												query appears justified, as 
												borne out by the sequence of 
												events apparent on the record. 
												The record of appeal for 
												instance shows that it was in 
												the course of heated exchanges 
												between the plaintiff and the 
												defendant's agent that plaintiff 
												mentioned that he had a business 
												meeting the following day the 
												16th July 2002 and must be 
												allowed to board the aircraft. 
												Having made the disclosure for 
												the first time and in the 
												obvious heat of passion, the 
												plaintiff required doing more 
												than merely mounting the witness 
												box to repeat the claim, to 
												warrant a determination in his 
												favour. In this endeavour 
												however, I find nothing 
												beneficial to the cause of the 
												plaintiff in this regard to 
												warrant liability being placed 
												on the defendant for the alleged 
												failed trip to Brussels, a claim 
												I find to be otherwise too 
												remote and unproven.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In arriving at this conclusion, 
												I am mindful that the plaintiff 
												failed to lead evidence to show 
												that he had indeed submitted any 
												bid for a contract in Brussels 
												and when. No bid documents were 
												tendered in evidence for 
												scrutiny by the court. The 
												sudden production of exhibit G 
												at the trial court did not 
												advance the issue for the simple 
												reason that the said document 
												did not comply with s. 161 of 
												NRCD 323 and was therefore 
												wrongly received. Exhibit G is 
												the letter dated July 18, 2002 
												on the letterhead of Independent 
												Diamond Valuators, signed by a 
												chairman and addressed to the 
												plaintiff, informing him of the 
												failed bid. By virtue of section 
												8 of NRCD 323, exhibit G is 
												hereby excluded from the record. 
												Yet another cause for doubt 
												about the Brussels bid, is the 
												total lack of evidence about any 
												effort made to reach or inform 
												the Brussels authorities about 
												the flight difficulties or 
												problems between the 15th July 
												2002 when plaintiff failed to 
												board the aircraft and the 16th 
												July 2002 when the bid was 
												supposed to be open for 
												consideration. Furthermore the 
												plaintiff did not consider it 
												necessary to disembark at 
												Amsterdam and proceed to 
												Brussels, which is shorter 
												instead of continuing to London, 
												with the intention of connecting 
												back to Brussels in mainland 
												Europe. Indeed from the 
												plaintiff's own testimony he did 
												not proceed to Brussels after 
												all. The plaintiff also woefully 
												failed to lead evidence stating 
												what time the meeting was 
												scheduled to take place at which 
												he was expected to be present. 
												All this aside, there is nothing 
												to show that it was indeed the 
												absence of plaintiff per se that 
												was responsible for his failure 
												to win the bid. In any case the 
												plaintiff was obliged to show 
												that the Brussels trip was in 
												the contemplation of the parties 
												when they first entered their 
												contract of transporting the 
												plaintiff on defendant's 
												aircraft. These inconsistencies 
												may individually appear harmless 
												but cumulatively they could 
												succeed in discrediting the 
												claim of the proponent of the 
												evidence. This is so with the 
												plaintiff on his claim about his 
												bid in Brussels. Notwithstanding 
												the failure of liability for the 
												alleged Brussels bid, the 
												plaintiff is nonetheless 
												entitled to damages based upon 
												the trial judge's finding that 
												the defendant deliberately and 
												unjustifiably prevented him 
												(plaintiff) from undertaking his 
												journey aboard their flight on 
												15th July 2002 to London. In 
												awarding damages based upon the 
												findings supra, this court must 
												bear in mind the evidence to the 
												effect that the plaintiff was 
												obliged to take up lodgment at 
												La Palm Beach Hotel that 15th 
												July 2002 and the travail he was 
												put to the next day to verify 
												his ticket. It would appear that 
												with the plaintiff's eyes 
												focused on the $600,000.00 US 
												dollars endorsed on his writ of 
												summons, he failed or did not 
												deem it necessary to throw some 
												light on the expenses he 
												incurred when he was put to this 
												discomfort by the actions of the 
												defendant. In any case, the 
												essence of an award of damages 
												is to give the plaintiff 
												compensation for the damage, 
												loss or injury he has suffered. 
												These comprise two main groups 
												notably pecuniary and 
												non-pecuniary loss. The former 
												is made up of all financial and 
												material loss incurred, such as 
												loss of business profits or 
												expenses of medical treatment. 
												The latter comprises all losses, 
												which do not represent an inroad 
												upon a person's financial or 
												material assets, such as 
												physical pain or injury to 
												feeling. The former being a 
												money loss is capable of being 
												arithmetically calculated in 
												money, even though the 
												calculation must sometimes be a 
												rough one where there are 
												difficulties of proof. The 
												latter is not so calculable. See 
												McGregor on Damages 14th 
												Edition, pane 10, (Sweet and 
												Maxwell). Also the speech of 
												Lord Blackburn in Livingstone 
												vs. Rawyards Coal Co. (1880) 5 
												App. Cas 25, 39, defines the 
												measure of damages as &quot;that sum 
												of money which will put the 
												party who has been injured, or 
												who has suffered, in the same 
												position as he would have been 
												in if he had not sustained the 
												wrong for which he is now 
												getting his compensation or 
												reparation. &#8220;Guided by the 
												authorities cited supra and in 
												the light of the evidence on 
												record, there is no doubt at all 
												that the plaintiff is entitled 
												to damages arising out of 
												damages to his feelings or what 
												is sometimes termed a damaging 
												reflection on the &quot;fair fame&quot; of 
												the plaintiff, but not to the 
												measure awarded by the trial 
												judge which I find excessive and 
												unwarranted. Consequently I 
												hereby set aside the fifty 
												thousand US dollars ($50,000) 
												damages against the defendant. I 
												substitute five thousand dollars 
												($5000) damages for the 
												plaintiff instead.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The next segment of this ground 
												of appeal complains about the 
												award of costs made against the 
												defendant. The defendant's 
												reason is that the award was 
												excessive and based upon 
												erroneous estimates. It is trite 
												to observe that a successful 
												party is usually entitled to 
												costs but this is a matter of 
												discretion for the trial judge 
												who is required to exercise his 
												discretion judicially, that is 
												to say, according to reason and 
												justice and not according to 
												sentiments or sensibility. 
												However a party who is aggrieved 
												by an award of costs may upset 
												it if he can show that the judge 
												wrongly exercised his discretion 
												in the particular case. See 
												Nartey-Tokoli vs Volta Aluminium 
												Co. Ltd (1987-88) 2 GLR 532, 
												Guardian Assurance Co. Ltd vs 
												Khayat Trading Store (1972) 2 
												GLR 48, Boullion Industries vs 
												Dizengoff Gh. Ltd, CA, 
												HI/85/2004 of 30th April 2004 
												(unreported). The trial court 
												awarded costs of ten million 
												cedis in favour of the 
												plaintiff. It is not clear what 
												the basis was for the award of 
												this colossal sum except for 
												what appears to be some measure 
												of trading between counsel which 
												ended in disagreement. The case 
												itself does not appear to be 
												complicated. The trial begun on 
												5th May 2003 and judgment 
												delivered on 17th June 2003. The 
												plaintiff called three witnesses 
												whilst the defendants called 
												one. I find in the circumstances 
												the costs of ten million 
												unjustifiable and it is hereby 
												set aside. I substitute cost of 
												four (4) million cedis for the 
												plaintiff in the court below.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The last point of contention I 
												propose to deal with is that the 
												learned judge erred by giving 
												judgment in favour of plaintiff 
												when his pleadings and evidence 
												adduced at the trial clearly 
												indicated that he has completely 
												and totally failed to discharge 
												or meet the burden of producing 
												credible evidence on the issues 
												before the court. In his 
												statement of case, the defendant 
												has sought to reopen or reargue 
												the point as to whether the 
												defendant's refusal to allow the 
												plaintiff on board its aircraft 
												manifestly and irresistibly and 
												solely resulted in the alleged 
												loss of a lucrative contract in 
												Brussels on 16th July 2002. That 
												point has already been resolved 
												and I do not intend to return to 
												it. Another issue raised in the 
												statement of case is whether or 
												not the refusal to allow or 
												carry plaintiff on board to 
												London on 15/7/2002 was 
												unlawful. On this point I dare 
												point out that the court below 
												had before it the sole account 
												of the plaintiff and his 
												witnesses. The line of 
												cross-examination not only 
												failed to make any punches in 
												the plaintiff's case, it also 
												failed to set out clearly the 
												case for the defence. This 
												aside, the defendant was content 
												at listening to the evidence led 
												by the plaintiff without leading 
												any evidence of its own to 
												counter that led by the 
												plaintiff. The result, rightly 
												to my mind, is that the trial 
												judge found for the plaintiff 
												based upon the evidence before 
												him that the refusal to allow 
												the plaintiff to board did not 
												accord with the defendants own 
												conditions of carriage. The 
												defendant's own conduct by not 
												cross examining the plaintiff on 
												crucial matters of disagreement 
												between them rendered it 
												unnecessary for plaintiff to 
												lead further evidence on those 
												points in accordance with 
												section 119 (a) and (b) of NRCD 
												323 which states that a party 
												who fails to cross examine on 
												the evidence led on an issue is 
												deemed to have admitted that 
												evidence. In Fori v Ayirebi 
												(1966) GLR 627 SC, the Supreme 
												Court in its holding (6) decided 
												that: &quot;When a party had made an 
												averment and that averment was 
												not denied, no issue was joined 
												and no evidence need be led on 
												that averment. Similarly when a 
												party had given evidence of a 
												material fact and was not 
												cross-examined upon, he need not 
												call further evidence of that 
												fact&quot; (Emphasis underlined). For 
												instance there was no attempt to 
												cross examine PW2 on his 
												testimony about the lady 
												(defendant's representative) 
												when she was quoted to have said 
												that she did not care and that 
												as far as she was concerned the 
												plaintiff had an invalid ticket 
												and whether the plaintiff had a 
												meeting with the Queen of 
												England was none of her 
												business. From the above 
												scenario the trial judge was 
												right in finding on the evidence 
												that the defendant deliberately 
												and unjustifiably prevented the 
												plaintiff from boarding the 
												aircraft. Equally disturbing for 
												the cause of the defendant was 
												their failure to call any 
												eyewitnesses to testify on their 
												behalf. They may have had a 
												strategic reason for not calling 
												the lady at the center of the 
												controversy but that strategy 
												could also be their undoing. 
												They equally failed to produce 
												the manifest for the day to show 
												whether the claim of the 
												plaintiff that he had booked his 
												flight was borne out. The trial 
												judge who was left with only the 
												testimony of the plaintiff on 
												the issue came to the right 
												conclusion on the matter and I 
												cannot fault him. There is no 
												merit in this ground of appeal 
												and it fails.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In view of the partial success 
												of this appeal the defendant 
												ought ordinarily to be entitled 
												to some costs but taking the 
												total circumstances of this case 
												into consideration I think that 
												there should be no order as to 
												costs.</span></p>
