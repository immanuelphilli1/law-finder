						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">BROBBEY J.A.:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is an appeal 
						against the decision of an Accra High Court in which 
						summary judgment was given against the defendant for 
						certain sums of moneys in both Cedis and American 
						Dollars which were owed to the plaintiff. The defendant 
						is described as the appellant herein and the plaintiff 
						as the respondent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The grounds of appeal 
						filed by the appellants were that</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) &quot;The High Court 
						Judge erred by granting the summons for summary judgment 
						since the pleadings were fraught with triable issues not 
						amenable to summary judgment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) Additional grounds 
						may be filed upon the receipt of a certified copy of the 
						judgment.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">No additional grounds 
						were filed. The appeal was therefore argued on the basis 
						of only one ground.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In sum, the basic 
						issues between the parties were as follows: the 
						respondent claimed that it was owed moneys by the 
						appellant. The amounts owed were in two different 
						currencies of US Dollars and Ghana Cedis. According to 
						the respondent, both sums remained unpaid as at the time 
						the writ of summons was issued against the appellant for 
						them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellant's answer 
						to the Dollar claim was that he had fully paid that 
						amount. He supported that claim with exhibit 3, a 
						statement of account which clearly indicated that the 
						appellant owed nothing on the Dollar account.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In reply, the 
						respondent averred that the appellant owed on both the 
						Dollar and Cedi account.&nbsp; When the appellant paid some 
						sixty thousand Dollars into the Dollar account, the 
						respondent changed that amount into Cedis and used it to 
						pay off the Cedi amount owed. From the wording of 
						exhibit F, a letter written by the respondent to the 
						appellant, it is apparent that the respondent converted 
						the Dollars into Cedis at its own exchange rate and used 
						the money to pay the Cedi debt before informing the 
						appellant of its action.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellant disputed 
						the authority of the respondent to use the Dollar amount 
						to pay off the Cedi debt. That alone raised a triable 
						issue which was not capable of being resolved by summary 
						judgment. The use of summary proceedings to resolve that 
						issue was wrong.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There are a number of 
						issues which arise from the use of the Dollars to pay 
						off the Cedi debt.&nbsp; These include the issues of set off 
						available to the respondents, the mandate which the 
						respondent had in the management of the appellant's 
						accounts and even the rate of the Cedi to the Dollar 
						used by the respondent in converting the Dollar into 
						Cedis. These cannot be commented upon now since the case 
						will be remitted to the trial court for re-trial on the 
						claim for the debt owed in Dollars. They however create 
						the unmistakable impression that there were triable 
						issues which had to be investigated before final 
						conclusion on liability for the debt could be reached. 
						The rule was summed up in the House of Lords case of 
						Jacobs v. Booths Distillery Co. (1901) 85 LT 262 as 
						follows;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Where there is a 
						triable issue, though it may appear that the defence is 
						not likely to succeed, the defendant should not be shut 
						out from laying his defence before the court either by 
						having judgment entered against him or by being put 
						under terms to pay money into court as a condition of 
						obtaining leave to defend the action.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Dollar aspect of 
						the case did not lend itself to the entry of summary 
						judgment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appeal will 
						consequently be allowed in part, that is, in respect of 
						the claim for the Dollar amount owed to the respondent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The claim for the Cedi 
						amount raised different considerations. The appellant 
						admitted owing the amount claimed. His defence to the 
						claim was that before he was granted that amount which 
						resulted in the Cedi debt, the Deputy Managing Director 
						of the respondent bank demanded a loan from him. That 
						resulted in the payment of forty million Cedis being 
						given to that deputy director. It was part of the 
						appellant's case that that amount given to the deputy 
						director had to be paid before he would be obliged to 
						pay his own debt owed to the bank on the Cedi account.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">That argument did not 
						find favor with the trial judge. She therefore entered 
						summary judgment on the Cedi debt against the appellant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">For at least four 
						reasons, the trial judge was right in entering judgment 
						against the appellant. The reasons are as follows; 
						Firstly, the appellant knew that he had to borrow money 
						from the respondent, a bank, which is a limited 
						liability company with a distinct legal entity; Mr 
						Sekyere Abankwa who allegedly demanded the money before 
						the appellant would be given the money was not the 
						lender who lent him the money which has been described 
						as overdraft facility from the bank. Secondly, it 
						appeared that Mr. Abankwa was not served with the 
						proceedings for the court to assess his reaction to the 
						allegation. That implies that even if the allegation 
						were to be false, the appellant did not provide 
						sufficient basis from which the trial court could have 
						evaluated the truth or otherwise of that allegation 
						against Mr. Abankwa. Thirdly, the allegation against Mr. 
						Abankwa sounded simply ridiculous. If the appellant 
						himself had forty million Cedis of his own to give as a 
						loan to someone working in the bank, why would he go to 
						the bank to borrow as overdraft the same amount of forty 
						million Cedis which he knew would have attracted 
						interest and bank charges? He did not state that he too 
						charged Mr. Abankwa any interest.&nbsp; Common sense alone 
						would lead to the conclusion that no business man would 
						do what he said he did with the bank or with Mr. 
						Abankwa.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Fourthly, the most 
						serious factor which militated against the appellant on 
						the alleged payment to Mr. Abankwa was what the money 
						paid was intended to be. Was it an inducement or bribe 
						to Mr. Abankwa for the purpose of securing the overdraft 
						from the bank? The appellant did not disclose why he had 
						to pay money to Mr. Abankwa apart from what appeared in 
						his statement of defence that Mr. Abankwa demanded to be 
						paid forty million Cedis before he would be granted the 
						overdraft of forty million Cedis and he did give that 
						amount to him.&nbsp; If it was a bribe, then the appellant 
						surely did not expect a court of equity and conscience 
						to have aided him to use bribe which is a crime as a 
						defense to a civil debt to a bank. If he meant to use 
						the bribe to found a cause of action against Mr. 
						Abankwa, the law was clearly against him. The applicable 
						principle is ex turpi causa non oritur actio, which 
						literally means that no one can found an action on an 
						illegality. See Schandorf v. Zeini [197] 2 GLR 418, CA. 
						and St John Shipping Corporation v. Joseph Rank Ltd. 
						[1957] 1 QB 267 at 288.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Quite clearly, the 
						appellant did not disclose any triable issue in respect 
						of the Cedi debt for which it should have been allowed 
						to go to trial to adduce evidence. As it was held in 
						Jones v. Stone (1894) AC 122</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Summary judgment is 
						intended only to apply to cases where there is no 
						reasonable doubt that the plaintiff is entitled to 
						judgment and where therefore it is inexpedient to allow 
						a defendant to defend for the mere purpose of delay&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Defence for the purpose 
						of delay seemed to be the undisputed impression that the 
						defense put up by the appellant to the Cedi claim 
						created.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">For these reasons, the 
						trial judge was right in rejecting his defence as a sham 
						and entering summary judgment against the appellant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the end, the appeal 
						succeeds in part. The appeal against the claim for the 
						$60,149.91 is allowed. The appeal against the Cedi debt 
						fails and is dismissed. The case should be remitted to 
						the trial court for evidence to be taken on the Dollar 
						claim for that claim to be decided on its merits.</span></p>

						<span style="font-family: Arial">BADDOO, JA:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is an appeal 
						against the Summary judgment delivered by the High 
						Court, Coram Ashong-Yakubu J, on the 30th of July 1999.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">FACT OF THE CASE</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The facts of the case 
						as disclosed by the statement of claim of the plaintiff 
						in the pleadings are that, the plaintiff is a Banking 
						Institution in Ghana, licensed to borrow and lend money. 
						In August 1997, the 1st Defendant a Limited Liability 
						Company requested a loan of 50,000 US dollars from the 
						plaintiff, to enable the Company execute an Export Order 
						for the supply of 85,000 metric tonnes of Robusta Coffee 
						to overseas buyers.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Defendant further 
						requested and received an additional loan of ¢40,000,000 
						from the plaintiff for the purchase of some coffee for 
						shipment to his buyers in July 1998.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The two facilities were 
						personally guaranteed by the second Defendant who also 
						offered as an additional collateral security, house No. 
						A352/15 Dansoman, Accra. A mortgage deed was executed 
						between the Bank and the second Defendant, to create a 
						legal charge over the said house at Dansoman.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was also agreed that 
						the 50,000 US dollars loan was to be repaid by the 28th 
						of February 1998, while the overdraft facility was to 
						have been repaid by monthly payment from 20th July 1998. 
						At the time of issuing the writ on the 6th of April 1999 
						the plaintiff claims that the Defendant has failed or 
						refused to settle its indebtedness in spite of verbal 
						and written demand for payment by the plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Bank charges and 
						interest, on the unpaid loans, have increased the 
						amounts due to the paid.&nbsp; These will continue to attract 
						interest at the prevailing bank rate, until repayment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Statement of Defence</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In response to the 
						especially indorsed writ filed by the plaintiff on 
						13/4/99, the Defendant entered appearance on 21/4/99 per 
						his Attorney and filed his defence on 6/5/99.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In paragraph 5 of the 
						Statement of Defence, the 1st Defendant claimed that as 
						far as that records show, the Private Enterprise 
						Development Project (PEED) facility has been repaid by 
						the Company.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">With regards to the 
						¢40,000,000 overdraft, Defendant averred in paragraph 6 
						of his statement of Defence that before the Company, Mr. 
						Sekyere Abankwa, demanded an equivalent amount of 
						¢40,000,000 from the Defendant before granting the 
						overdraft. Consequently, the Defendant after paying

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Summons for Summary 
						Judgment</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the 6th of May 1999, 
						the plaintiff applied to the Court for Summary Judgment 
						under Orders 14 r1 as amended by L.I. 1129 on the 
						grounds that the Defendants have no defence to the 
						action.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the 30th July 1999 
						the learned trial judge ruled as follows: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Having heard 
						plaintiff/applicant on their motion and being convinced 
						as shown from the documents that there are truly no 
						triable issues and further that the Defendant's defence 
						is a sham, this Court rules as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">That the 
						plaintiff/appellant motion be granted. Summary judgment 
						hereby entered in favour of the plaintiff to recover 
						from Defendant herein as per the reliefs indorsement on 
						their writ of summons and statement of claim viz debt 
						sum of ¢49,857,467 and the cedi equivalent of the US. 
						Dollar sum of $60,149.91. Alternatively the judicial 
						sale of the property, viz House No. A352/15 Dansoman 
						aforesaid. Also cost of ¢10 million.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">APPEAL</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Against this judgment 
						the Defendants have appealed to this Court on the 
						grounds that the High Court erred by granting the 
						summons or summary judgment since the pleadings were 
						fraught with triable issues not amenable to summary 
						judgment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The matter for 
						determination before the Court therefore is whether or 
						not there are triable issues disclosed in the pleadings 
						which are not amenable to summary judgment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">General Principles</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Under Order 14 r1 a 
						plaintiff can apply for summary judgment in an action, 
						where the Defendant has been served with a statement of 
						claim and has filed appearance, on the ground that the 
						Defendant has no defence to the claim contained in the 
						writ.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A Defendant however can 
						show cause against the application for summary judgment, 
						by affidavit or otherwise and the Court may order the 
						Defendant to be examined on oath or to produce any 
						document if it appears to the Court that this is 
						desirable under the circumstances.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Court may also, on 
						the hearing of the application give judgment for the 
						plaintiff against the Defendant on the relevant claim or 
						part thereof as the case may be, unless the Defendant is 
						able to satisfy the Court that there is an issue which 
						ought to be tried, or there ought for some other reason, 
						to be a trial of that claim or part of it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the other hand the 
						Court may give the Defendant leave to defend the action 
						with respect to the relevant claim or part thereof 
						either unconditionally or on terms.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Court may also 
						dismiss the application with cost to be paid by the 
						plaintiff, if it appears that the case is not within 
						Order 14 or that the plaintiff knew that the Defendant 
						relied on a contention which would entitle him to 
						unconditional leave to defend the action.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Matter of Determination</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The matter for 
						determination is whether or not there are triable issues 
						which the Court below should have tried.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In their Statement of 
						Defence paragraph 8, the Defendants claimed that the 
						Private Enterprise Export Development (PEED) loan of 
						50,000 US Dollars had been repaid by the 1st Defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the Supplementary 
						affidavit filed by the 1st Defendant it was averred that 
						the loan of 50,000 US dollars had been repaid by the 1st 
						Defendant as evidenced by Exh. 1, 2 and 3.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Now Exh. 1 and 2 are 
						Credit Advice from the plaintiff Company, showing that 
						the sum of U.S.D. 43722.36 and 16,786.24 respectively 
						were credited to the accounts of the 1st Defendant in 
						May and June 1998. The total of the two credits amount 
						to 60508 US dollars while Exh. 3 is the Defendant 
						Statement of Accounts, showing that he has discharged 
						all his obligations as at 3rd June 1998.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In response to Exh. 1, 
						2, 3, the plaintiffs claim that the payments were 
						applied to pay off an outstanding temporary overdraft 
						owed by the 1st Defendant which then amounted to 
						¢149,195,210.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Thus while the 
						Defendants claim that the payments on exhibits 1, 2, 3, 
						were for the liquidation of the Private Enterprise 
						Development loan, the plaintiff claim that they were for 
						the repayment of an outstanding temporary overdraft owed 
						by the Defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Clearly there seems to 
						be some controversy and the controversy is whether or 
						not the 60508.60 US dollars paid by the 1st Defendant 
						was for the repayment of an outstanding overdraft which 
						is not the subject matter before any Court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It seems to me that 
						this dispute raises a triable issue, which should have 
						been tried by the Court.&nbsp; It will be instructive to 
						quote what Taylor J said in the case of Duncan v. 
						Kawoaco Ltd. [1981] GLR 476:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The principles which 
						the Courts had for years applied in dealing with summons 
						under Order 14 were well known. The defence to be set up 
						need only show that there was a triable issue and leave 
						to defend ought then be given unless there was clearly 
						no defence in law and there was no possibility of a real 
						defence on the question of fact. The Court will be 
						entitled to look at the statement of defence filed 
						without leave: the fact that a bona fide defence had 
						been delivered might very well be sufficient to enable a 
						Defendant to get leave to defend, although if it would 
						be shown that the defence was a sham, leave to the 
						Defendant might be refused and the plaintiff will be 
						given summary judgment. As Bowes LJ said in Blaiberg v. 
						Abrahams 1910 77 L.T.J. 255, &quot;In deciding whether the 
						defence set as is the real defence or not, all the 
						Circumstances must be looked&quot;. When all the 
						circumstances are looked at what emerges is that the 
						Defendant has put forward a defence which if it can be 
						proved, the action against him must fail. It may be he 
						may not be able to prove it at the trial, that is not 
						the question. The question is the outcome of the action 
						on the assumption that he is able to prove what he 
						alleges&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The picture that 
						emerges from the pleadings is that the 1st Defendant has 
						two accounts with the plaintiff Bank, - A Dollar Account 
						and A Cedi Account. In both accounts, the 1st Defendant 
						is indebted to the Bank.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Since the 1st Defendant 
						operates these two accounts, it is reasonable to hold 
						that when he pays in cedis, it must be credited to his 
						Cedi Accounts, and when he pays in dollars, his dollar 
						accounts receives the credit. This should be the 
						reasonable course for the Bank to take, since it is not 
						easy to generate dollars in the Country, except through 
						the export sector.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Therefore, when the 1st 
						Defendant paid into his dollar Accounts the sum of 60508 
						US dollars, he reasonably assumed that he was 
						discharging his obligations in respect of the PEED loan 
						of 50,000 US dollars.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">If he had intended to 
						discharge his obligation with regard to the cedi 
						overdraft he would have changed the dollars at the Forex 
						Bureau, like any reasonable person, where he would have 
						received a higher rate of exchange than available at the 
						Bank, and then pay into his Cedi Accounts.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was unreasonable and 
						unfair to the 1st Defendant, for the plaintiff Bank to 
						unilaterally decide to exchange the 60508 U.S.D. paid in 
						by the 1st Defendant to liquidate the PEED loan, into 
						cedis at the Bank rate which is lower than the Forex 
						Bureau rate, and credit the Cedi Accounts of the 1st 
						Defendant, knowing very well that the 1st Defendant had 
						an outstanding dollar loan to pay.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is my considered 
						opinion that there is a triable issue as to whether the 
						Dollar payments made by the Defendants were in respect 
						of the PEED loan or another facility which is not a 
						subject matter before this Court or any other Court for 
						that matter.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">With regard to the 
						overdraft of ¢40,000,000, the 1st Defendant had admitted 
						obtaining the loan and paying only ¢12,000,000.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">His averment that the 
						Deputy M.D extorted the equivalent sum of ¢40,000,000 
						from them before releasing the loan, is no defence to 
						the action, especially when there was no counter claim 
						against the plaintiffs Company.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">For these reasons, the 
						appeal shall be allowed in part.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The summary judgment in 
						respect of the U.S.D. 60149.91 is set aside. The 
						Defendant is hereby granted leave to defend the claim.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Judgment is given 
						against the Defendant in respect of the claim of the Sum 
						of ¢40,000,000.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Judicial Sale of
