						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">TWUMASI, J.A.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is an appeal 
						against the ruling delivered by the High Court, Tamale 
						on the 31st March, 1998. The facts show that on the 24th 
						December, 1992 the respondents, Unilever (Ghana) Limited 
						instituted legal proceedings against the appellant, a 
						business agent and tenant to the respondents for the 
						recovery of an amount ¢4,992,248.40 said to be arrears 
						of rent and value of goods supplied by the respondents 
						under what was described as a deedership Agreement 
						between the parties. The appellant counter claimed for 
						reliefs comprising damages for breach of the said 
						agreement. At the close of pleadings, summons for 
						directions was duly taken and a date was fixed for the 
						hearing of the suit.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the due date the 
						case was further adjourned at the instance of the 
						respondents. Several adjournments were subsequently made 
						because of the persistent absence of counsel for the 
						respondents.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The record shows that 
						on the numerous occasions that the court yielded to 
						adjournments, service of hearing notices had been 
						effected either on the solicitors of the respondents or 
						their representative at Tamale, to be precise, the 
						Manager of Unilever (Ghana) Limited in that regional 
						capital. Matters came to a head when the court 
						apparently having exhausted all its indulgence in the 
						conduct of the respondents, dismissed their claim on the 
						17th April 1996 leaving the counter-claim for hearing on 
						the 23 May, 1996. An order was made that the Registrar 
						caused a hearing notice to be served on the respondents. 
						On the due date both counsel for the parties were absent 
						and the case was adjourned sine die. The case was 
						relisted for hearing on the 29th April, 1997. Notices 
						were ordered to be served on the parties and their 
						counsel to appear on the 26th May, 1997.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel for the 
						respondents then filed a motion for relistment of the 
						case but never pursued it. Amidst this bizarre state of 
						affairs afflicting the fate of the lawsuit, Counsel for 
						the respondents wrote a letter dated 9th May, 1997 to 
						the Deputy Registrar of the court copied to their Tamale 
						representative informing them that he had withdrawn his 
						services as from that date. This prompted the 
						respondents&#8217; representative by a letter dated 20th May 
						1997 to apply to the court for an adjournment while he 
						arranged for the services of a new Counsel.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The court obliged and 
						adjourned the hearing to the 18th June, 1997. The 
						respondents had been served on 2nd June with the hearing 
						notice but on the due date they failed to attend court 
						and no new Counsel appeared on their behalf. The record 
						further shows that the court adjourned the hearing to 
						the following day, as the court put it, &#8220;for the court 
						to satisfy itself about the plaintiff&#8217;s (respondents&#8217;) 
						absence&#8221;. On the following day the court commenced the 
						hearing of the counter-claim.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">One interesting fact on 
						record was that at the time the court heard the 
						counter-claim the motion for relistment was pending 
						before the court, but the record does not offer any clue 
						as to the hearing of that motion.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">What followed in 
						sequence, however, was an application by the 
						respondent&#8217;s new Counsel before the court then 
						differently constituted praying for an extension of time 
						within which to appeal against the judgment given on 
						25th July, 1997 in favour of the appellant on the 
						counter-claim and also against the dismissal of the 
						respondents&#8217; claim on the 17th April 1996. The motion 
						was filed on the 26th January, 1998 at 9.05 a.m. The 
						learned trial judge granted the application for 
						extension of time.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is against this 
						ruling that the defendant/appellant lodges this appeal. 
						His main ground of appeal&nbsp; reads;&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The learned trial 
						judge erred in granting the application when the 
						conditions precedent for such grant were not fulfilled.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel for the 
						appellant submitted that the learned trial judge was 
						wrong for the following reasons among others;&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) because he erred 
						with respect to the time within which the application 
						could have been made;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) because there were 
						no good and substantial reasons for the application,</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) because there were 
						no grounds or any sufficient grounds of appeal which 
						prima facie, show good cause for the extension&nbsp; to be 
						granted.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I intend first to deal 
						with the issue of time. The rules provide that a 
						prospective appellant has 21 days within which to appeal 
						against an interlocutory judgment: See rule 9(1) of the 
						Court of Appeal Rules 1997 (C.I.19) and three months 
						within which to appeal against a final judgment: See 
						rule 9(1)(b) thereof.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The rules following 
						thereafter are vital for the purpose of this appeal and 
						I reproduce them hereunder. It is provided in rules 4 
						and 5 of C.I. 19 that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;(4) No application for 
						extension of time in which to appeal shall be made after 
						the expiration of three months from the expiration of 
						the time prescribed by this rule within which an appeal 
						may be brought.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(5) An application for 
						extension of time must be supported by an affidavit 
						setting out good and substantial reasons for the 
						application and grounds of appeal which, prima facie, 
						show good cause for the extension of time to be 
						granted.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The record shows that 
						the respondents&#8217; claim was dismissed on the 17th. April, 
						1996 but the&nbsp; motion for extension of time was filed on 
						26th&nbsp; January, 1998. It is quite obvious that the 
						application was woefully out of time. Counsel for the 
						respondents submitted that the dismissal of the action 
						was not warranted by Order 36 rule 17 because the court 
						did not simultaneously call on the appellant to prove 
						his claim, consequently the dismissal was void and 
						liable to be set aside. I am clearly of the opinion that 
						a fair understanding of the rules calls for the 
						reproduction of rules 16, 17 and 18 of Order 36 of the 
						High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 1954 (14A):&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">They provide that:&#8212;
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(16) If when a trial is 
						called on the plaintiff appears, but the defendant does 
						not appear, then the plaintiff may prove his claim, so 
						far as the burden of proof lies upon him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(17)&nbsp; If when a trial 
						is called on, the defendant appears but the plaintiff 
						does not appear, the defendant, if he has no 
						counter-claim, shall be entitled to judgment dismissing 
						the action, but If he has a counter-claim he may prove 
						it so far as the burden of proof lies upon him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(18) Any verdict or 
						judgment obtained where one party does not appear at the 
						trial may be set aside by the court or Judge upon such 
						terms as may seem fit.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is patent that rules 
						16, 17 and 18 of Order 36 of the High Court (Civil 
						Procedure) Rules 1954 (LN 140 A) were designed to assure 
						for both parties in a lawsuit a high degree of fairness 
						by clearly prescribing effective sanction for default of 
						appearance at the trial and at the same time providing a 
						fair compromise for a party&#8217;s default in a manner that 
						serves the ends of justice.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Under these rules a 
						verdict of judgment remains valid unless it is set aside 
						within the statutory fourteen days or within a period 
						extended by the court or judge by an application under 
						Order 64: see Schafer vrs: Blythe (1920) 3 KB 141; 
						Bradshaw vrs: Warlow 32 Ch D 408 CA and Mitchell vrs: 
						Wilson 25 W.R. 380.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Cases which shed 
						brighter light on the application of the rules are those 
						decided in our own jurisdiction, namely, Djorbua vrs: 
						Poku (1371) 1 GLR.93; Safo-Adu vrs: Boampong (1974) 2 
						GLR. 107 Nsiah vrs: Osei (1975) 1 GLR.257 Amoako Atta IV 
						vrs: Nuamah (1963) 1 GLR.432; Ghana Commercial Bank vrs: 
						Tabury (1977) 1 GLR.329. All these cases have one 
						central principle, among others, that the party wishing 
						to set aside a verdict or judgment must give good 
						reasons for his default and also satisfy the court that 
						some useful purpose would be served by setting aside the 
						judgment or verdict. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The right to appeal 
						against such verdict or judgment exists as of right but 
						the Court of Appeal both in England and in Ghana or 
						elsewhere has always expressed disinclination to 
						encourage that process.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Thus in Vint vrs: 
						Hudspith (1885) 29 Ch D.322 Bowen L.J. said</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;I should be sorry to 
						decide that the court has not jurisdiction to entertain 
						an appeal from a judgment given by default; but it is 
						equally clear that it is a bad practice to encourage 
						parties</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">to come here without 
						first having their cause in the first&nbsp; instance tried by 
						the court below.&#8221;and Cotton LJ added:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;I am far from saying 
						that this Court cannot entertain an appeal from a 
						judgment made by default, but in a case like the present 
						it is important to prevent the Court of Appeal from 
						being flooded by having to hear cases in the first 
						instance. It is therefore right that the plaintiff 
						should first apply to the judge who gave the judgment to 
						restore the action.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A veiled approval of 
						these sentiments by English judges can be found in 
						Amoako Atta vrs Nuamah (1963) 1 GLR.432 at 437 where the 
						Supreme Court of the First Republic of Ghana speaking 
						through Akufo-Addo JSC (as he then was) said:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;........ I agree with 
						Counsel that the defendants should have applied to the 
						court below for relief under Order 36 rule 18 and 
						indeed, in my view, it is desirable that in such 
						circumstances such an application should first be made 
						if for no other reasons than that it is less expensive 
						procedure than that of an appeal. But failure to do so 
						does not disentitle the aggrieved parties from 
						exercising their undoubted right to appeal to this 
						court. The case of Vint Vrs: Hudspith (1885 29 Ch D 322 
						CA.) cited by counsel is not applicable for there the 
						plaintiff failed to appear and the suit was struck out 
						and judgment entered for the defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I doubt whether such an 
						order made pursuant to Order 36 rule 17 of the Supreme 
						(High) Court (Civil Procedure) Rules can be said to be a 
						judgment or a decision from which an appeal can be 
						brought in this court. A judgment must ascertain or 
						establish a previously existing liability of a defendant 
						to a plaintiff (see Re Riddel: Ex-Parte Earl of 
						Strathmore, 1888 20 QBD 512 Per Lord Esher MR), and a 
						decision according to the New Zealand case of Winter 
						vrs: Calder 1933 NZLR.289, implies the exercise of 
						judicial determination as the formal and definite result 
						of examining a question. An order dismissing a 
						plaintiff&#8217;s action for want of prosecution does not 
						answer to the attributes of a judgment or a decision and 
						I am doubtful whether such an order is appealable 
						......... It is not necessary to reach a firm decision 
						on that point and I would prefer to leave the matter 
						open.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">For our present 
						purposes I think that it is counsel of prudence to leave 
						the point still open. It is my view that this court duly 
						constituted to hear the appeal would be the proper forum 
						to deal with the point. However, since the respondents 
						have opted for an appeal it is incumbent</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">upon them to satisfy 
						this court on two matters essential to the grant of an 
						application for extension of time within which to appeal 
						(i) good and substantial grounds for the delay in filing 
						the appeal (ii) grounds of appeal which prima facie, 
						justify the grant of the application. Counsel for the 
						appellant submits that the respondents failed to satisfy 
						these conditions at the court below and consequently 
						were not entitled to the grant of the application. In 
						granting the application all that the trial judge stated 
						was as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;I have carefully read 
						through the whole docket and read also the motion paper 
						and the supporting papers. I have also carefully 
						considered submissions by Counsel and have come to the 
						conclusion that the chequered nature of the case permits 
						the grant of the application. I therefore grant the 
						application&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This finding is of no 
						practical assistance to this court because the trial 
						judge failed to apply his mind to the process of 
						judicial determination of the issue before him. The 
						learned judge's duty was to have analysed the 
						Respondents' affidavit to see whether it contained good 
						and substantial grounds for the application for 
						extension of time within which to appeal and grounds of 
						appeal which prima facie showed good cause for the 
						extension of time to be granted.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The gist of the 
						affidavit was that the respondents suffered as a result 
						of the lukewarm approach of their first solicitor 
						towards the prosecution of their claim and they were 
						thus compelled to engage the services of a new 
						solicitor.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Judging from the 
						judgment of the trial judge one could hardly find 
						anything that merited any commisceration from this court 
						for the respondents and or their first counsel or 
						solicitor. For example it is on record that the 
						Respondents abused the indulgence of the court on 
						several occasions by not appearing in court. Typical of 
						this was the fact that when their first Counsel withdrew 
						his services the trial judge gave them three weeks to 
						find a new Counsel but they never appeared. Counsel for 
						the respondent in his statement of case submitted that 
						the dismissal of the claim was void and therefore the 
						rules of court relating to limitation of time were 
						inapplicable. He relied on Mosi vrs: Bagyina (1963) 1 
						GLR. I think it is of vital importance to demonstrate 
						the distinctive characteristic of the principle in Mosi 
						vrs: Bagyina from the facts of the instant case 
						regarding the application of rules 16, 17 and 18 of 
						Order of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 1954 
						(LN.140A.) Under Mosi vrs: Bagyina a party affected by a 
						judgment or order is entitled ex debito justitiae (as of 
						right) to set the said judgment or order aside. The 
						court or judge suo motu can also set it aside for the 
						simple reason that that judgment or order had been 
						rendered void ex vigore, legis by breach of some rule of 
						procedure or substantive law: See dicta by Atuguba, JSC 
						in Acheampong vers: The Republic (1996-97) SC.GLR.566 at 
						576.78. However, Counsel for the respondents submitted 
						that the dismissal of the respondents' claim was void 
						because it was not followed instantly by the hearing of 
						the defendant's counter-claim and to that extent it 
						violated the true spirit of order 36 rule 17 and 
						rendered the dismissal void. This argument seems 
						plausible on a critical construction of rule 17. The 
						rule says that if the plaintiff does not appear, then 
						the defendant shall be entitled to judgment dismissing 
						the plaintiff's claim but if he has a counter-claim, he 
						may prove it so far as the burden of proof lies on him. 
						The rule carries within it an unanswered question and it 
						is this: Where there is a counter-claim does the court 
						or judge still have to dismiss the plaintiff's claim? No 
						answer is offered by the rule but the reasonable 
						deduction is that the court would have to exercise a 
						judicial discretion. Although a court has an inherent 
						jurisdiction to adjourn the trial of any case such as a 
						counter-claim under such circumstances for good 
						reasons:&nbsp; See&nbsp; In re Yates Settlement Trustee (1954) 1 
						WLR CA and Order 63 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) 
						Rule 1964 (LN 140A) but the question is: Would it be a 
						proper exercise of judicial discretion for a court faced 
						with the application of order 36 rule 17 to dismiss the 
						plaintiff&#8217;s claim and yet adjourn the defendant&#8217;s 
						counter-claim? It seems to me that in fairness to both 
						parties the court must exercise its discretion to 
						adjourn the proceedings if it is not ready to proceed 
						with the trial of the counterclaim. To do otherwise 
						could raise doubts about the judge&#8217;s judicial 
						impartiality. The exercise of discretionary power by 
						public officers vested with such power is now governed 
						by the Constitution 1992 where article 296 provides 
						that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) that discretionary 
						power shall be deemed to imply a duty to be fair and 
						candid;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) the exercise of the 
						discretionary power shall not be arbitrary, capricious 
						or biased either by resentment, prejudice or personal 
						dislike and shall be in accordance with due process of 
						law&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This provision 
						re-enacts the principles laid down in judicial 
						decisions: See Boswell&#8217;s case (1605) 6 Co. Rep..486 at 
						p.52. In re Brook, Dekomyn and Badart (1864) 46 CB (NS) 
						403 at 416. Buabeng vrs: Forkuo Court of Appeal 2nd 
						February 1970 unreported digest in (1970) CC 59 all 
						cited in Adu vrs The Republic [1976] 1 GLR.55 at 56. For 
						the foregoing reasons I am afflicted by grave doubts in 
						my mind as to whether the trial judge exercised his 
						judicial discretion properly when he dismissed the 
						respondent&#8217;s claim. It must be pointed out, however, 
						that where a discretion is improperly exercised the 
						aggrieved party has a right of appeal to impugn such 
						decision, an appeal would not be the ideal option under 
						Order 36 rule 17 because rule 18 provides a statutory 
						remedy for the party affected by the decision to set it 
						aside within fourteen days. The plight which beset the 
						respondents was the initial gambit of their first 
						solicitor which was a complete detour from the right 
						procedure that ought to have been taken under rule 18. 
						He messed himself up with an application to relist the 
						suit. The respondents&#8217; new counsel also unfortunately 
						persisted in the appeal process.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He could have 
						alleviated the plight of the respondents by applying to 
						the court below for extension of time under Order 64, 
						rule 7 of the High Court (Civil Procedure Rules) 1954 
						(LN.140A) to set aside the order dismissing the claim 
						and paid costs just to get the case back on track. That 
						procedure is less expensive and more liberal than the 
						appeal process in the sense that under Order 64 there is 
						no time limitation inhibiting judicial discretion as 
						the&nbsp; position is under rule 9 of C.I. 19. The upshot of 
						all this is that the appeal against the dismissal is out 
						of time and the trial judge erred in granting extension. 
						The appeal is accordingly allowed in respect of the 
						dismissal of the respondent&#8217;s claim. It is undoubtedly 
						still open to the respondents to avail themselves of 
						Order 64.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We however remit this 
						case to the court below with an order that the motion 
						for relistment be heard on its merit in order to serve 
						the ends of justice.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Unlike the appeal 
						against the dismissal of the respondents&#8217; claim which 
						was woefully out of time the appeal against the judgment 
						in respect of the counter-claim was within the statutory 
						time so the condition for time limitation of six months 
						was fulfilled. The judgment was delivered on the 25 
						July, 1997 and the application for extension of time 
						within which to file the appeal was filed on the 26th 
						January, 1998 only one day out of time if in computing 
						the time the 25th January, 1997 which was a Sunday is 
						added.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this regard, as 
						Counsel for the respondents rightly submitted that 
						Sunday ought to be excluded by reason of section 22(5) 
						of the Interpretation Act 1960 (CA.4) which provides 
						that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">25(5):&nbsp; Where the time 
						limited by an enactment for the doing of anything 
						expires on a Sunday or a public holiday, the time so 
						limited shall extend to and the thing may be done on the 
						first day following that which is not a Sunday or public 
						holiday.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The position therefore 
						is that the application was within time in respect of 
						the counter-claim and it thus fulfilled one of the 
						conditions required for such applications.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the affidavit 
						supporting the application, Counsel for the respondents 
						deposed to the fact that the time for filing the appeal 
						had elapsed when he received the necessary documents and 
						briefing on the case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He did not state the 
						exact date of the receipt and why the filing of the 
						application for extension of time was delayed. 
						Paragraphs 13 and 14 of Counsel&#8217;s own affidavit (supra) 
						lay the blame squarely at the door of the respondents 
						themselves. The principle that the court should not 
						visit the sins and defaults of a lawyer on his client 
						stems from sheer judicial magnaminity rooted in the 
						court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction to do justice: See Mensah 
						vrs: Adjei (1981) GLR.360 where the court refused to 
						punish clients for the mistake of their lawyer in 
						reporting a judgment to the Chief Justice instead of 
						filing an appeal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instant case 
						there is ample evidence to show that both Counsel for 
						the respondents have been guilty of professional lapses 
						eg. filing a motion for relistment and again filing a 
						motion for extension of time within which to appeal 
						instead of proceeding under Order 36 rule 18. With 
						regard to grounds of appeal no such ground as required 
						under rule 9 of C.I. 19 were stated in the Respondents&#8217; 
						affidavit in support of their application for 
						enlargement of time.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was only in his 
						written statement of case before this court that the new 
						Counsel for the Respondents endeavoured to argue what he 
						termed grounds of appeal all impugning the proceedings 
						before the lower court as being a nullity. I think it is 
						necessary to stress that the proper procedure in 
						applications for extension of time is to devote at least 
						one paragraph of the affidavit for the proposed grounds 
						of appeal and to show where the trial judge or court 
						erred on the facts or the law or mixed law and fact in 
						his judgment or order or ruling.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The court would then 
						take a decision whether the grounds disclose a prima 
						facie case for the grant of the application. This 
						procedure is obviously designed to place total embargo 
						on applications for enlargement of time for appeals 
						which may be considered unmeritrious frivolous and 
						vexatious.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">However, the test is 
						not so much whether or not the grounds of appeal have 
						bright prospects of success as whether or not they raise 
						serious questions for determination by the appellate 
						court. Thus in&nbsp; Nye vrs: Nye (1964) GLR. 95 where of the 
						First Republic had occasion to rule on rule 10(4) of the 
						Supreme Court rules 1962 (LI 218) which is re-enacted 
						under rule 9(5) of our Appeal Rules 1996 (C.I.19), the 
						application before the court for extension of time 
						within which to appeal had raised the issue of whether 
						the High Court of Ghana had jurisdiction to entertain an 
						issue relating to a matrimonial cause involving parties 
						domiciled in England. The affidavit cited a legislation 
						in England which the applicant contended permitted the 
						courts of Ghana to try such case if the parties were 
						resident in this country. On this issue Apaloo J, (as he 
						then was) stated at page 98:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Whether that view is 
						right or not it is not necessary to express an opinion 
						just now. It seems, however, that the applicant has a 
						serious question of law for submission to this court and 
						I would on that account, be inclined to grant 
						enlargement of time.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instant case 
						although counsel for the Respondents did not raise any 
						grounds of appeal in his affidavit in support of the 
						application for extension of time he has before this 
						court raised very crucial questions of law as to the 
						legal effect of a dismissal of a plaintiff&#8217;s claim under 
						Order 36 rule 17 in a case where the defendant has a 
						counter-claim. This case also raises the question of law 
						as to whether as it occurred in the instant case a trial 
						judge or court is bound to order a hearing notice to be 
						served on a plaintiff whose case has been dismissed 
						under Order 36 rule 17 to attend the hearing of the 
						counter-claim and to make such order&nbsp; even when&nbsp; the 
						plaintiff had failed to attend to the first notice upon 
						being served. The facts of this case show that when the 
						trial judge fixed the 18/6/97 for the hearing of the 
						counter-claim, hearing notice ordered by the court was 
						served on the Respondents on the 2/6/97 but on the 
						18/6/97 they never attended court. It is my humble view 
						that whenever a court adjourns a trial and directs that 
						a party to the suit be served with a hearing notice it 
						does so in solemn compliance with the hallowed rule of 
						nature justice, audi alteram partem which like all other 
						rules of practice at the courts is primarily designed to 
						ensure fairness to all parties as justice commands.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This implies that where 
						a party does not respond to the court&#8217;s call he commits 
						contempt of court and until he purges that contempt he 
						would not be entitled to any further notice: See the 
						case of Safo and Another vrs: Badu (1977) 2 GLR.63. The 
						facts of this case were that at the hearing counsel for 
						the defendants sought an adjournment on certain reasons 
						and the court, exercising its discretion adjourned the 
						trial to a named date but on the due date none of the 
						parties appeared in court and the trial magistrate fixed 
						another date without ordering that hearing notices be 
						served on the parties. On the adjourned date, the 
						plaintiff who had made enquiries from the registry and 
						had been advised of the adjourned date attended court 
						and the court heard and determined the suit in favour of 
						the plaintiff. On appeal counsel for the defendants 
						submitted inter alia, that the trial magistrate did not 
						observe the rules of natural justice when it heard the 
						case in the absence of the defendant. In rejecting this 
						submission Roger Korsah J, (as he then was) said at 
						p.68:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The audi alteram 
						partem rule to which counsel refers means simply this: 
						that natural justice requires that no condemnation 
						should be pronounced behind the back of a man who has 
						had no opportunity to appear and defend his interest, 
						either personally or through his proper representative. 
						But the court would not hold a judgment to be contrary 
						to natural justice where the trial court had 
						jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the suit and the 
						parties thereto, and where the parties have duly and in 
						accordance with the common law idea of natural justice 
						been summoned to the trial court so as to have had a 
						hearing or opportunity of being heard: See Robinson vrs: 
						Fenner (1913) 3 K.B.835. The defendant herein was 
						summoned to the trial court, she had an opportunity of 
						being heard and would have been heard if she had 
						exhibited vigilance comparable to that of the plaintiff. 
						There was therefore no breach of the audi alteram partem 
						rule which would render the judgment of the trial court 
						void as suggested by counsel&#8221;. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The correctness of the 
						statement of the law by Roger Korsah, J. (as he then 
						was) can hardly be caviled at let alone criticised but 
						that is one question, the other being whether the facts 
						of that case to which he applied the law fall on all 
						fours with the instant case. On the latter issue I am a 
						bit sceptical as I direct focus of attention to what the 
						trial judge is recorded to have undertaken to do, 
						namely, to adjourn the case for the court to satisfy 
						itself about the absence of the plaintiff&#8217;. In my view 
						this undertaking implied that the trial judge would 
						inquire about the reasons for the absence of the 
						plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There is however 
						nothing on record which shows that the learned trial 
						judge kept faith that&nbsp;&nbsp; his self-imposed but solemn task 
						of judicial enquiry. But the relevant portions of a 
						letter dated 4th August, 1997 from the Group Legal 
						Advisor of Unilever, the Plaintiff, addressed to Mr 
						Luguterah, the new Counsel, is most revealing and I
