												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I would like to preface this 
												decision with a few comments on 
												landlord-tenant relationship in 
												this country. The problem of 
												landlord-tenant relations is one 
												of the most frequently recurring 
												matters that the law and society 
												have still not succeeded in 
												grappling with effectively. That 
												is the position notwithstanding 
												various enactment&#8217;s&#8217; put in 
												place, at one time or the other; 
												some ad hoc only, others die out 
												like a passing wind. In the face 
												of all these difficulties and 
												uncertainties in this area of 
												law enforcement, one enactment, 
												namely, the Rent Act, 1963 (Act 
												220), has stood the test of 
												time, not withstanding the 
												different and sometimes 
												conflicting interpretations 
												given to its various provisions. 
												The very fact that this 
												particular enactment, together 
												with its regulations, namely, 
												Rent Regulations, 1964 (L.I. 
												369), have survived even the 
												revolutionary rent laws in the 
												evening of the 1970&#8217;s and the 
												early 1980&#8217;s is a sure 
												indication that their provisions 
												have come to be accepted and 
												must be enforced by the courts 
												in order to bring some sanity 
												into the sometimes turbulent 
												regime of landlord-tenant 
												relationship.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												One of the areas in this 
												landlord-tenant relationship 
												that very often evokes bitter 
												conflict is that relating to 
												rent assessment. It seems to me 
												it is an area where the 
												enactment is more honoured in 
												its breach than observance. And 
												quite ironically, the tenants 
												themselves, who the law seeks to 
												protect, are as guilty as the 
												landlords when it comes to 
												complying with the laws and 
												regulations governing assessment 
												of recoverable rent. Whatever 
												the reasons may be, there is no 
												justification for a court of law 
												to fall prey to this 
												non-observance of the rent law 
												and its regulations. Indeed that 
												is one of the serious questions 
												raised in this appeal where the 
												trial court appeared to have 
												endorsed the plaintiffs&#8217; claim 
												for a rent increase without 
												applying the laid down process 
												for achieving that. Under relief 
												2 endorsed on the writ of 
												summons, the plaintiffs sought 
												an increase of a hundred per 
												cent in the rent being paid by 
												the defendant, their tenant. The 
												basis for this increase, 
												according to the evidence of the 
												first plaintiff, was that the 
												defendant had failed to pay any 
												rent since the agreement expired 
												in 1995. She admitted under 
												cross- examination that before 
												she took this action she did not 
												go to the rent office. However, 
												the trial judge upheld this 
												claim. This is what the trial 
												judge said: &#8220;I think a rent of 
												¢6 million per annum is 
												reasonable having regard to the 
												type of house in question and 
												the location. I therefore order 
												the defendant to pay rent of ¢6 
												million per annum with effect 
												from 1/5/95 to the date he will 
												give vacant possession or the 
												date the plaintiffs will recover 
												possession.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The defendant appealed against 
												this conclusion and order on two 
												grounds, namely:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												i) That the honourable trial 
												Circuit Court Judge gravely 
												erred when he granted 
												respondents&#8217; relief of &#8216;double 
												rent&#8217; when he has no legal power 
												to assess rent and nowhere in 
												the statutes is the issue of&nbsp; 
												&#8216;double rent&#8217; provided.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												ii) Wrongful or improper 
												exercise of jurisdiction in 
												assessing recoverable rent of 
												premises.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel for the appellant 
												submitted that under the Rent 
												Act, &#8220;assessment of recoverable 
												rent is vested in the Minister 
												who may refer, in accordance 
												with such regulation, to the 
												appropriate Rent Magistrate to 
												assess the recoverable rent.&#8221; 
												With all due respect to learned 
												counsel this submission is not 
												correct in so far as it sought 
												to make the Minister the sole 
												person permitted by law to 
												authorise rent assessment. The 
												Minister is given power under 
												Section 11 of Act 220 to cause 
												the appropriate Rent Magistrate; 
												to assess the recoverable rent 
												for any premises, whether public 
												or private owned. Another power 
												invested in the Minister is to 
												be found in Section 13 of Act 
												220 whereby he is empowered to 
												assess recoverable rent for 
												similar premises in similar 
												localities, particularly where 
												such premises have been built 
												out of public funds, and he is 
												entitled to do this by executive 
												instrument. Besides these powers 
												that the Minister possesses, the 
												Rent Officers are also empowered 
												by Section 10 of Act 220 to 
												assess the recoverable rent in 
												certain given circumstances. The 
												court is not empowered by this 
												Act to assess rent in the first 
												instance; it could do so if 
												there is a reference to it by 
												the Minister, or if it comes to 
												it on appeal from an assessment 
												by the rent officer.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel for the respondents 
												sought to get around this hurdle 
												when he submitted that what the 
												trial judge did was not 
												tantamount to a rent assessment 
												but only an evaluation of the 
												evidence in deciding on what the 
												rent should be. In counsel&#8217;s 
												submission &#8220;where there was an 
												agreement between the parties as 
												is evidenced by exhibit A which 
												agreement clearly and 
												unambiguously stipulated the 
												rent to be paid by the 
												appellant, no issue of 
												assessment arises. An assessment 
												of rent envisages a situation 
												where there is a dispute as to 
												the rent to be paid.&#8221; This 
												argument is basically 
												misconceived in the sense that 
												if the rent had been agreed upon 
												there would have been no need to 
												claim &#8216;double rent&#8217;; moreover, 
												the rent fixed by the trial 
												judge is not what the parties 
												had agreed upon as contained in 
												exhibit A. The fact that the 
												trial judge considered it 
												necessary to take into account 
												factors like the nature and 
												location of the property before 
												settling on the recoverable rent 
												clearly confirms that the trial 
												judge embarked on a rent 
												assessment. The trial court did 
												not have the power to do that. 
												As a statutory tenant, the 
												defendant was living in the 
												premises subject to the payment 
												of the same rent as agreed upon 
												under the previous agreement; 
												until the landlady had reached a 
												fresh agreement on rent with the 
												tenant or has had the rent 
												re-assessed under Section 10 of 
												the Rent Act. These grounds of 
												appeal succeed. However, the 
												plaintiff is entitled to recover 
												rent at the rate of ¢3 million 
												per annum from 1/5/95, the date 
												the agreement expired, to the 
												16th of May, 1999, the date that 
												the appellant is said by his 
												counsel to have vacated the 
												premises in question.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The next ground of appeal argued 
												by counsel for the appellant was 
												that the trial Circuit Court 
												exceeded its jurisdiction with 
												respect to the claim and damages 
												awarded. Counsel referred to the 
												jurisdiction of a Circuit Court 
												in liquidated claims which is 
												limited to ¢10 million and in 
												respect of landlord-tenant 
												matters as set out in section 41 
												of the Courts Act, 1993 (Act 
												459). By the claim and the award 
												made by the trial court, the 
												plaintiffs were to recover about 
												¢37 million. He submitted that 
												&#8220;the trial Circuit Court 
												exceeded its jurisdiction under 
												Act 459 in ordering recovery of 
												arrears of rent in excess of its 
												limit of ¢10 million as provided 
												by law.&#8221; On the question of the 
												huge rents claimed by the writ, 
												it was counsel&#8217;s submission that 
												&#8220;the trial judge ought to have 
												referred the issue ... to the 
												High Court by virtue of Section 
												41(2) of Act 459,&#8221; 
												Alternatively, counsel submitted 
												that &#8220;the trial Circuit Court 
												could otherwise have determined 
												the issue ... if the parties had 
												given their consent. No such 
												consent was however given.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In his response, counsel for the 
												respondents cited a reported 
												decision of the High Court, 
												which gives the Circuit Court 
												jurisdiction. That was the case 
												of WOOD VS. DADSON (1976) 2 
												G.L.R. 185. That was a case in 
												which the rent magistrate 
												awarded arrears in rent that was 
												far in excess of its 
												jurisdiction in liquidated 
												claims; it awarded more than 
												¢10,000.00 even though its 
												jurisdiction was limited to 
												¢2,000.00. The High Court, in 
												upholding the award, said at 
												page 187, per Edusei J. (as he 
												then was), that &#8220;a claim for 
												arrears of rent is not only a 
												debt simpliciter; it is a debt 
												with a difference&#8212;a debt arising 
												out of a relationship between 
												landlord and tenant and the Act 
												does not limit jurisdiction of 
												the district court when it comes 
												to dealing with civil causes or 
												matters relating to landlord and 
												tenant. If it was the intention 
												of the legislature to limit a 
												district court in its 
												jurisdiction as regards civil 
												causes or matters relating to 
												landlord and tenant it would 
												have employed such 
												words........&#8221;That case was on 
												all fours with the instant one, 
												notwithstanding the fact that it 
												involved a District Court. What 
												is important is the jurisdiction 
												given to inferior courts and 
												tribunals in landlord-tenant 
												matters. So the trial Circuit 
												Court was bound by it, being a 
												court below the High Court. That 
												decision itself is perfect in 
												the sense that the inferior 
												courts, which are given such 
												jurisdiction primarily, 
												determine what the periodic rent 
												is, before the cumulative total 
												is worked out arithmetically. 
												And on arrears of rent, the 
												primary jurisdiction is to 
												handle matters affecting 
												landlord and tenant, and rent 
												may come up for consideration, 
												and that per se should not deny 
												its jurisdiction. Instances 
												abound in such jurisdictional 
												areas. One is matters relating 
												to maintenance claims under the 
												Maintenance of Children Decree, 
												1977 (S.M.C.D.133). Jurisdiction 
												under that Decree is conferred 
												on family tribunals established 
												under it, which tribunals are 
												part of the inferior courts, 
												equated with District Courts, 
												now Community Tribunals. Yet it 
												cannot be argued that a claim 
												for maintenance under that 
												Decree is beyond that tribunal&#8217;s 
												jurisdiction; or can one 
												complain that the tribunal 
												exceeded its jurisdiction by 
												awarding a sum of maintenance 
												which is in excess of its 
												ordinary civil jurisdiction. The 
												same applies to arrears in 
												contribution to the Social 
												Security fund. Where special 
												enactment has been passed that 
												gives jurisdiction to a 
												particular court to hear certain 
												matters, it must be assumed that 
												it invests that court with all 
												powers relating to the 
												subject-matter, unless express 
												words to the contrary are used, 
												or it could be inferred from its 
												plain language that its 
												jurisdiction is circumscribed. 
												In such a situation, it could 
												not be justified to rely on 
												another enactment that does not 
												make a direct reference to the 
												special enactment to say its 
												jurisdiction is ousted 
												inferentially under the other 
												enactment. The other enactment 
												must specifically or expressly 
												oust the exercise of 
												jurisdiction or give 
												jurisdiction to another court or 
												tribunal. This ground 
												accordingly fails and is 
												dismissed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Another ground of appeal raised 
												was that the trial judge was 
												biased in accepting and relying 
												on address filed by plaintiffs 
												before evidence was concluded. 
												Counsel&#8217;s complaint was that the 
												trial court accepted and relied 
												on an address that was filed for 
												the plaintiffs long before the 
												oral evidence was completed. 
												That the trial Judge ignored 
												this anomaly when his attention 
												was drawn to it. Counsel 
												therefore submitted that &#8220;this 
												action by the trial Judge 
												constituted bias against the 
												defendant....&#8221; Really I fail to 
												understand the purpose of this 
												ground, except that one can read 
												through it an attempt to 
												embarrass the trial Judge. This 
												is because, as explained by 
												counsel for the plaintiffs, the 
												filing took place on August 25, 
												1998, and not on May 25, 1998. 
												Indeed the court copies bear the 
												date 25 August, 1998. So that if 
												his copy bears a different date, 
												then Counsel ought to have 
												accepted the explanation that it 
												could only be a mistake, and I 
												believe a genuine one too. That 
												it could have been the result of 
												a mistake is borne out by the 
												contents of that address, in 
												which reference is made to the 
												evidence of the defendant&#8217;s own 
												witness, named Quarshie and 
												described in the proceedings as 
												DW4. The said Quarshie was the 
												third witness who testified for 
												the defendant after the 25th of 
												May, 1998, the date counsel 
												claims the address was filed. 
												There is no allegation that 
												plaintiffs&#8217; counsel knew in 
												advance who the witnesses for 
												the defendant were going to be. 
												And even if it is said that 
												counsel for the plaintiffs had 
												foreknowledge of the witnesses 
												for the defendant, how would he 
												have known the order in which 
												they were going to give their 
												evidence as to enable counsel 
												describe Quarshie as the fourth 
												witness in his submission? And 
												how on earth would he have known 
												what exactly the said witness 
												was going to say as would enable 
												him rely on his testimony in his 
												written address even before he 
												had taken the witness stand? 
												Much as counsel is allowed a lot 
												of room to conduct a case for a 
												client, it must be borne in mind 
												that the dignity and credibility 
												of the legal profession is also 
												on the line, so baseless 
												accusations should not find 
												their way into our work. I 
												believe it is sufficiently clear 
												that counsel for the defendant 
												never read the address of his 
												opposite party before he made 
												those wild charges, which I am 
												more than convinced were only 
												aimed at embarrassing the trial 
												judge. This ground of appeal is 
												as callous as it is 
												unprofessional; it's simply 
												without any basis or merit and 
												is accordingly rejected.</span></p>

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Next counsel for the appellant 
												referred to the defendant&#8217;s 
												counter-claim wherein he had 
												claimed for the cost of 
												constructing a fence wall, which 
												was damaged by excess rains. At 
												the time that the wall 
												collapsed, this action was 
												already pending before the court 
												below. The defendant began to 
												reconstruct it and notified the 
												plaintiffs accordingly. He also 
												pleaded it and made same the 
												subject of his counter-claim. 
												The plaintiffs&#8217; response was 
												that the defendant did not have 
												their consent to construct that 
												broken wall.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I consider it necessary to quote 
												in extenso what the trial Judge 
												said on this issue. He said: 
												&#8220;the evidence shows that when 
												the fence wall collapsed and the 
												defendant evinced an intention 
												to reconstruct it on his own the 
												plaintiffs specifically wrote to 
												request him not to construct the 
												collapsed wall. The plaintiffs 
												stated in the said letter which 
												was tendered as Exhibit 3 that 
												the collapsed fence wall was 
												constructed by the Labone 
												Secondary School and that the 
												school had invited personnel of 
												the Field Engineers Regiment of 
												the Ghana Armed Forces to 
												inspect the collapsed fence and 
												advise them on what to do. The 
												plaintiffs therefore advised the 
												defendant to desist from 
												constructing the fence wall and 
												to vacate the property. Inspite 
												of this advice the defendant 
												engaged workers and 
												reconstructed the collapsed 
												fence wall. It is clear that the 
												defendant undertook to 
												reconstruct the fence wall 
												without the authority of the 
												plaintiffs and landladies and in 
												complete disregard to the clear 
												request by them to him not to 
												reconstruct the collapsed fence 
												wall. If the defendant chose to 
												undertake the reconstruction 
												when he had been asked not to do 
												so then he cannot be heard to 
												say that the plaintiffs as 
												landladies should refund 
												expenses incurred on the fence 
												wall. It is my finding that the 
												defendant is not entitled to any 
												refund in respect of any 
												expenses he incurred in 
												reconstructing the fence wall.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is significant to note that 
												the 1st plaintiff said under 
												cross-examination that they (the 
												plaintiffs) would have 
												constructed the wall if the 
												defendant had not done so. This 
												was a very important piece of 
												evidence the relevance of which 
												entirely escaped the trial 
												Judge. The plaintiffs recognised 
												the need to re-build this wall, 
												except that they did not want 
												the defendant to do it for them, 
												because they had sued him for 
												recovery of possession. But the 
												defendant remained a statutory 
												tenant who was entitled to the 
												full protection of the law and 
												to enjoy the premises to the 
												full, including all its existing 
												fixtures, which by paragraph 3c 
												of exhibit A he was enjoined 'to 
												keep in good and tenantable 
												repair', fair wear and tear 
												excepted. No doubt a fence wall 
												is a fixture being permanent in 
												character. But could the 
												defendant reconstruct without 
												the consent of the landlady? 
												Wear and tear, when applied to 
												demised premises, do not include 
												total destruction by a 
												catastrophe which was never 
												contemplated by either party. So 
												this wall whose collapse 
												occurred through an act of God 
												does not come within paragraph 
												3c of Exhibit A.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel for the plaintiffs 
												relied on paragraph 3f of 
												Exhibit A which is one of the 
												tenant's covenants which 
												prohibits him from making 'any 
												alterations or additions to the 
												property without the written 
												consent of the landladies.' 
												Counsel's submission was that 
												the defendant acted in breach of 
												this covenant by constructing 
												the fence wall in the teeth of 
												all the opposition from the 
												plaintiffs. I think by 
												'additions' is meant structural 
												additions. But as said in RE 
												LEVESON-GOWER'S SETTLED ESTATE 
												(1905) 2 Ch. 95, per Swinfen 
												Eady, J. at page 98 &quot;the 
												erection of a new building in 
												place of an old building is not 
												an addition to or alteration in 
												that old building.&quot; Thus by 
												erecting a new fence wall in 
												place of the old one which had 
												collapsed the defendant could 
												not be said to be in breach of 
												this covenant. If anything at 
												all the defendant's assertion 
												that the fence wall was 
												absolutely necessary to a 
												complete enjoyment of this 
												property was never disputed. The 
												house shares common boundary 
												with the Labone Secondary School 
												at the point where the wall 
												collapsed, and no one can deny 
												the necessity in closing such a 
												wall to the students. Besides a 
												fence wall is a kind of 
												protection for the safety of at 
												least property in the premises, 
												and also to secure the privacy 
												of the occupants therein. For 
												that reason the law excepts such 
												construction, without being in 
												breach of the covenant. In other 
												words, alterations or additions, 
												which are reasonably necessary 
												for the enjoyment of the 
												premises, or absolutely or 
												reasonably essential for the 
												purpose for which the premises 
												were taken, do not amount to a 
												breach of the covenant against 
												alterations and additions. I 
												think it was the failure to 
												consider this exception, which 
												applies that, led the trial 
												court to hold that the 
												plaintiffs were not responsible 
												for the cost of re-construction. 
												So long as the plaintiffs 
												admitted they were responsible 
												for it, the fact that the 
												defendant did the actual 
												construction against their wish 
												would not enable them to escape 
												responsibility for paying for 
												the cost of repairs. This is 
												because the evidence was clear 
												that the plaintiffs were not 
												prepared to do it because they 
												did not want the defendant to 
												continue to stay in the house. 
												It could thus pass for inducing 
												the tenant to quit which the 
												Rent Act frowns upon, see s.27 
												thereof. Time was of the essence 
												if the defendant was to have his 
												property in the house protected 
												and to secure his privacy, so he 
												was justified in erecting the 
												fence wall following the 
												plaintiffs' refusal in doing so 
												when requested by the defendant 
												as per his letter of July 6, 
												1995&#8212;Exhibit 2. The plaintiffs 
												did not reconstruct the wall, 
												and unreasonably withheld 
												consent in the circumstances. 
												The trial Judge, therefore, 
												erred in refusing the claim by 
												the defendant for a refund of 
												the sum spent on this by him, 
												which cost was put at ¢5 
												million. This ground of appeal 
												is accordingly upheld.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The two remaining grounds, 
												namely failure to visit the 
												locus in quo and adverse 
												comments alleged to have been 
												made by the trial Judge against 
												the defendant, to my mind, do 
												not have any impact on this 
												case. A trial court is not bound 
												to visit the locus in quo. 
												Though desirable in certain 
												cases, yet failure to visit the 
												locus is not fatal to a court's 
												decision if there is sufficient 
												evidence to support its 
												findings. A court must be very 
												certain a visit to the locus in 
												quo will help it determine 
												matters in controversy between 
												the parties, otherwise such a 
												visit could even amount to an 
												abuse of its discretion, as 
												happened in the case of DARFOUR 
												JNR. V. BOATENG (1976) 2 G.L.R. 
												191 CA.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I consider the remarks passed on 
												the personal character of the 
												defendant by the trial Judge as 
												rather unfortunate and 
												undesirable. But to the credit 
												of the Judge all his decisions 
												were based on the facts in 
												evidence and what he perceived 
												the law to be. But I think we, 
												as Judges, should be wary of 
												passing adverse comments on a 
												party's character unless it's in 
												issue or unless evidence has 
												been led and the Judge is 
												relying on it to destroy his 
												credit. But reckless and 
												unnecessary remarks must be 
												avoided. So in conclusion, the 
												appeal is allowed to the extent 
												that the trial court erred in 
												assessing the recoverable rent 
												when it did not have the power 
												to do that. However, the 
												plaintiffs are entitled to 
												recover rent at the rate of ¢3 
												million per annum from the 
												expiry of the agreement to the 
												date the defendant vacated the 
												premises, as earlier stated. The 
												appeal is also allowed to the 
												extent that the defendant was 
												entitled to be reimbursed the 
												cost of ¢5 million spent on 
												re-constructing the fence wall. 
												In order to bring this dispute 
												to an end in the present 
												proceedings, the sum of ¢5 
												million spent on rebuilding the 
												fence wall should be deducted 
												from the total rent the 
												plaintiffs have been adjudged to 
												be entitled to recover and the 
												difference is ordered to be paid 
												by the defendant to the 
												plaintiffs. The appeal is 
												dismissed on all the other 
												grounds.</span></p>
