												ANIN YEBOAH, J. A.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In these proceedings the 
												appellant herein (the plaintiff 
												in the court below) seeks the 
												reversal of the judgment of the 
												court below entered in favour of 
												his adversary, the respondent 
												herein who was the defendant in 
												the trial High Court holden at 
												Akim-Oda. In his action before 
												the trial court the appellant 
												sought an order to set aside 
												what he described as a 
												redistribution of the estate of 
												Opanin Kweku Boadi. In addition 
												to this relief the appellant 
												also sought an order of 
												perpetual injunction against the 
												persons in whose favour the 
												alleged redistribution was done, 
												namely the respondents herein as 
												well as damages for trespass and 
												a refund of the amount paid by 
												him to the panel which conducted 
												the proceedings resulting in the 
												redistribution which provoked 
												the action herein.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This explains why the fourth to 
												the ninth defendants who were 
												members of the panel were made 
												parties to the action. I must 
												say that the reliefs indorsed on 
												the writ as sealed from the 
												registry of the court below 
												included a demand for cost but 
												in my view nothing of any 
												consequence needs be attached to 
												the said claim for it was an 
												incompetent relief; one which is 
												always in the discretion of the 
												court and not a legitimate head 
												of claim. Upon the service on 
												him of the writ the respondent 
												submitted himself to the 
												jurisdiction and also 
												counterclaimed in respect of the 
												proceedings leading to the 
												redistribution of the estate of 
												Opanin Kweku Boadi. In his 
												statement of defence and 
												counterclaim he described the 
												process leading to the 
												redistribution as an arbitration 
												and therefore naturally claimed 
												against the appellant that the 
												said arbitration was regular. In 
												my opinion, the effect of the 
												grounds raised in this appeal is 
												whether having regard to the 
												evidence, the judgment of the 
												trial court was reasonable. This 
												to my mind raises considerations 
												of mixed law and fact turning 
												upon the evaluation of the 
												evidence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												At the end of the pleadings 
												several issues were raised in 
												respect of which directions were 
												taken under Order 30 of the 
												rules of the trial court. 
												Subsequently the matter 
												proceeded to a full-scale trial. 
												In the middle of the evidence of 
												the appellant, a lawyer other 
												than the one known to the record 
												purportedly applied for the 
												setting down of the issue of 
												estoppel by arbitration which 
												was raised against the appellant 
												by the respondent. I wish to 
												note of the said process which 
												was filed by the new counsel 
												that it was one which offended 
												against the rules as to 
												appearance and or change of 
												solicitors but since the 
												appellant waived his objection 
												thereto and the learned trial 
												judge saw nothing wrong with the 
												said process but took action 
												thereon, I think that he must 
												have treated it as a mere 
												irregularity by virtue of Order 
												70 hence, I shall not waste any 
												further time beyond the passing 
												observation regarding what to me 
												was quite a serious lapse of the 
												settled practice of the courts 
												in such matters. The notice of 
												the application appears at page 
												45 of the record of proceedings 
												and thereafter there is no 
												record of any submissions being 
												made to the court regarding the 
												point filed at pages 46 to 49. 
												Yet at page 50 of the record 
												which from a close reading of 
												the record must have been the 
												first appearance at which if 
												anything counsel in the matter 
												could be heard on the 
												application the learned trial 
												judge read a ruling on the 
												application as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Having heard both counsel I am 
												of the opinion that the 
												preliminary issue for 
												determination in this case is 
												the validity or otherwise of the 
												arbitration at which the estate 
												of Opanin Kwaku Boadi was 
												allegedly redistributed. All the 
												other reliefs sought by the 
												plaintiff and the 
												defendants-counterclaimants 
												depend upon, and flow directly 
												from the validity or nullity of 
												the arbitration. It is therefore 
												directed that the evidence 
												adduced by the parties be 
												limited to the events that will 
												assist the determination of the 
												said&nbsp; preliminary issue ie- the 
												validity or otherwise of the 
												arbitration.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												My first observation regarding 
												this order is that it is not 
												borne by any entry in the record 
												as far as the taking of the 
												motion is concerned. There is no 
												indication in the record that it 
												was either moved by the 
												applicant or any arguments were 
												received by the court from 
												counsel on same. As a matter of 
												fact, on the 12th of December, 
												2001, the last adjournment 
												before the delivery of the 
												ruling on the 21st of December 
												to which date the further 
												consideration of the case was 
												adjourned there was no record of 
												any submissions by counsel for 
												the respondents who were in 
												court and as such it is more 
												probable that indeed there was 
												no hearing of the application. 
												In my view, this observation 
												renders the ruling of the 
												learned trial judge one, which 
												was not based on the record of 
												what actually transpired 
												erroneous in so far as the 
												learned trial judge&#8217;s delivery 
												says that he had heard counsel 
												in the matter. I refrain from 
												saying what the position would 
												have been if he made the ruling 
												without making any reference to 
												a hearing which never took place 
												but purely on the motion as 
												filed which in my thinking 
												raised for his determination a 
												question of law in which case 
												the role of counsel is only to 
												assist him in making a 
												pronouncement on the legal 
												position beyond saying that 
												different considerations would 
												have arisen. In the instant 
												case, if I may remark he had 
												said something of a positive 
												nature which is not supported by 
												the record the effect of which 
												is that the only legitimate 
												inference that this court might 
												make from the proceedings is 
												that thesic took into account 
												extraneous matters without 
												giving the parties the benefit 
												of his information. I notice 
												that the point on which this 
												turns was not raised by either 
												party but say in answer thereto 
												that it being a point of law 
												which is apparent from an 
												examination of the record it is 
												legitimate for this court to 
												consider the same. See - Food 
												Specialties v Ramia (1989-90) 
												2GLR 327 per Adade JSC (as he 
												then was).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As a result of this ruling the 
												matter proceeded on the very 
												narrow limits directed by him at 
												the end of which he decided that 
												what transpired was not 
												arbitration but a negotiated 
												settlement, which he upheld in 
												favour of the respondents 
												against the appellant. For now, 
												I shall limit myself to the 
												question which turns on this 
												appeal in terms of the 
												complaints filed by way of 
												grounds of appeal and in respect 
												of which written statements have 
												been submitted to us by the 
												parties. I have examined the 
												record closely and I am of the 
												view that the holding as to a 
												negotiated settlement was not 
												raised by either party to the 
												action and by basing his 
												decision thereon the learned 
												trial judge fell into error. I 
												think that it is quite well 
												settled without any conflict of 
												judicial authority that 
												arbitrations and negotiated 
												settlements have different modes 
												of procedure and constitute 
												different informal methods of 
												seeking redress in our 
												traditional set up. Thus, in the 
												case of Mensah v Essah (1976) 
												1GLR 424 where a party based his 
												claim on an arbitration which 
												from the evidence did not 
												measure up to the essentials of 
												a customary arbitration the 
												Court of Appeal in a judgment 
												delivered by Francois J.A. (as 
												he then was) set aside the 
												finding of the court below on 
												the ground that the plaintiff 
												had failed to prove that what 
												transpired was an arbitration 
												properly so called. The said 
												decision also laid down the 
												distinction between arbitration 
												and a negotiated settlement. See 
												also Obadzen v Onanka II 
												(1982-83) GLR 46. Therefore in 
												my view where a party to an 
												action sets up one but not the 
												other as the plank of his case 
												he must be held either to 
												succeed or fail on his plea. 
												This being the case, I think 
												that it was not open to the 
												learned trial judge to have 
												substituted a case that is 
												substantially separate and 
												distinct from that raised by the 
												respondents' counterclaimants. 
												The situation is perhaps more 
												serious when one refers to the 
												direction given by the learned 
												trial judge after the hearing of 
												the application for the 
												determination of the matter by 
												means of evidence limited to the 
												validity or otherwise of the 
												arbitration on which the 1st, 
												2nd and 3rd respondents relied 
												to sustain their counterclaim. I 
												am of the opinion that having 
												found the arbitration not proved 
												in terms of the essential 
												requirements which ran through 
												the collection of cases on the 
												subject, the court ought to have 
												dismissed the counterclaim and 
												found for the appellant since 
												the basis of the proceeding 
												which justified the 
												redistribution no longer 
												existed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												That in my thinking is 
												sufficient to dispose of the 
												appeal on the merits but there 
												is one point of procedure which 
												struck me on the record as 
												fundamentally irregular. There 
												is first the course of procedure 
												adopted by the learned trial 
												judge following his reception of 
												arguments on the application 
												resulting in the direction, 
												which changed the course of the 
												trial. I think that a patient 
												examination of the pleadings 
												show as indeed was revealed by 
												the issues, which were set down 
												for the trial that beyond the 
												issure of the arbitration&nbsp; there 
												were several other matters to be 
												tried. I refer by way of example 
												to the claim by the appellant 
												that the estate had long been 
												distributed and that the 
												respondents had had their share 
												of the estate. This, in my 
												opinion was a serious matter 
												which turned on the pleadings 
												and yet the learned trial judge 
												saw it differently. That the 
												said issue was important and 
												required a determination soon 
												became apparent when in his 
												judgment, the subject matter of 
												these proceedings he attempted 
												belatedly to direct his mind to 
												its resolution at page 110 as 
												follows</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;May I digress shortly and state 
												briefly that the plaintiffs 
												evidence that Opanin Kwaku Boadi 
												distributed all his properties 
												during his life time is 
												self-contradictory and also not 
												in accord with his pleadings and 
												therefore unconvincing&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												My Lords, clearly the above 
												speech of the presiding judge of 
												the court below exposes the 
												error he came to when he 
												directed that the determination 
												of the action before him be 
												limited only to the question of 
												the arbitration without taking 
												advantage of the procedure 
												available to him under Order 36 
												rule 4 of the High Court rules 
												to direct a separate trial of 
												issues of fact which may arise 
												in an action and the mode and 
												order of such trial. In my view 
												if he had taken advantage of 
												this rule he would not have 
												fallen into the difficulty that 
												I have just referred to in an 
												apparent attempt to extricate
