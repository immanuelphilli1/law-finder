						<span style="font-family: Arial">ADINYIRA (MRS.) J.A.:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is an appeal from 
						the decision of the High Court Tema, dated 20 July, 
						2001. The plaintiff /respondent (hereinafter referred to 
						as the respondent) issued a writ against the 
						defendant/appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 
						appellant) on 22 April, 1999 for:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) Punitive 
						damages/compensation for physical injuries sustained at 
						work in or about August 1996 which has resulted in total 
						loss of the use of plaintiff's right eye;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) An order to compel 
						the defendant to pay the plaintiff entitlements/ 
						benefits provided under the employment laws of Ghana.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The respondent failed 
						to enter appearance within the stipulated time of 8 days 
						of service of the writ on him on 28 April, 1999. The 
						respondent accordingly applied for and obtained judgment 
						in default of appearance on his claim on 13 May, 1999. 
						The case was adjourned to 9 June 1999 for assessment of 
						damages. The defendant later on the same day entered 
						appearance. He was served with hearing notice for 
						assessment of damages. Before damages could be assessed, 
						Counsel for the appellant filed on 16 June 1999 a motion 
						to set aside the default judgment and for leave to file 
						a defence out of time to be moved on 14 July 1999. On 10 
						August 1999 both appellant and counsel were absent and 
						their motion was accordingly struck out. After several 
						adjournments evidence was given by the respondent on 14 
						March 2001 for assessment of damages and counsel for the 
						appellant cross-examined the respondent. The case was 
						adjourned to 22 March for further cross-examination. In 
						the course of the cross-examination counsel asked that 
						his motion to set aside the default judgment be relisted. 
						Counsel for the respondent objected that it was not the 
						proper procedure for relisting and the objection was 
						sustained. The Court in its final judgment awarded tile 
						respondent damages for ¢30 million.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellant being 
						dissatisfied appealed on the following grounds</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) The trial was a 
						mistrial or non trial or both.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) The learned trial 
						judge did not allow the medical report tendered by the 
						plaintiff to be subject to cross examination as the 
						plaintiff did not call the medical officer who was said 
						to have issued the medical report.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) The learned trial 
						judge did not allow or consider the defence of the 
						defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d) The damages awarded 
						were wrong in law and too excessive.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He filed additional 
						grounds of appeal that;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The Motion Ex parte 
						for Abridgement of time for assessment of damages was 
						procedurally wrong and therefore null and void since at 
						the time the application was made the 
						defendant/appellant had entered appearance which was on 
						the docket.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In his statement of 
						case the appellant used grounds (b) and (c) to 
						substantiate his first ground of appeal that &quot;the trial 
						was a mistrial or non trial or both. &quot;His first argument 
						was that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">'It is my submission 
						that after the medical report had been tendered and 
						accepted in evidence it was the duty of the plaintiff to 
						bring the author of the Exhibit 'B' to court to give 
						evidence and be cross-examined since the plaintiff 
						himself could not answer any questions on it. It was 
						agreed that the medical doctor would be called. 
						Strangely enough</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I went to Court only to 
						be told that counsel for the plaintiff had decided not 
						to call the medical officer to testify and closed the 
						case for the plaintiff.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial judge in her 
						judgment considered this fact and stated:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">'It is also my view 
						that the medical doctor's evidence, if he had been 
						called personally, would not have determined the quantum 
						of damage to be awarded the plaintiff. The doctor would 
						have helped the court to determine the extent of injury 
						sustained by the plaintiff and future effect of the 
						injury of plaintiff. All these can be found clearly 
						stated in Exhibit '8' that is the medical report 
						tendered by the plaintiff.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Portions of the medical 
						report dated 19 April 1999 are as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Mr. J.K. Apprey, aged 
						approximately 60 years, was first seen in this clinic on 
						17th October 1996 with the history of blurred vision in 
						the right eye. This occurred when a plank of wood hit 
						the right eye at his worksite 3 months earlier. Findings 
						were as follows: . . . . In addition he had vitreous 
						haemorrhage in the right eye. Subsequent follow up 
						revealed that he had also Retinal Detachment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">His vision in the right 
						eye has persistently deteriorated. As at now he is 
						totally blind in the right eye (vision=NPL).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Disability is fixed at 
						fifty percent (50%).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel for the 
						appellant did not demonstrate to this court why the 
						failure of the plaintiff to call the medical officer to 
						be cross-examined on his report amounted to a mistrial 
						or a non trial. I do not propose to make any conjectures 
						as I do not see any. If counsel for the appellant felt 
						it was necessary to call the medical officer he could 
						have applied to do that on behalf of the appellant. I do 
						not think failure to call the medical officer amounted 
						to any miscarriage of justice as the medical report the 
						respondent tendered in evidence was sufficiently clear 
						to enable the court to determine the extent of injury 
						the respondent suffered and the extent of his disability 
						to enable the court to assess the quantum of damages to 
						be awarded. This ground of appeal is misconceived and it 
						must therefore fail.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">His next argument was 
						that the trial judge did not allow or consider the 
						defence of the defendant. He submitted that he filed a 
						motion to set aside the interlocutory judgment and for 
						leave to file a defence out of time. But this was struck 
						out as both his client and him were absent from Court. 
						He said there was no record of his application for 
						relistment. He also said the court refused to allow his 
						motion for relistment to be taken on the day that 
						assessment of damages commenced. He also complained that 
						his written address was also not on record.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I do not see how this 
						catalogue of complaints could be a valid ground of 
						appeal and amount to a mistrial. Did he ask for these to 
						be included in the record at the time he was settling 
						the record at the court below? Why did he not apply to 
						the Court of Appeal for their inclusion if he 
						desperately found them vital to his case after he was 
						served with Civil Form 6 and he had collected his copy 
						of the record and saw the omissions? With all due 
						respect to counsel, what I term his litany of woes, 
						rather show the lackadaisical manner in which the 
						defence was handled. The writ of summons together with 
						the statement of claim was served on the appellant on 28 
						April 1999. The appellant entered appearance on 13 May 
						1999 the very day that interlocutory judgment was 
						entered, but according to counsel for the appellant, 
						much later in the day after judgment has been. given. 
						This motion to set aside the judgment etc. was filed 
						after notice of assessment of damages has been served on 
						defendant. The court had to strike it out for want of 
						prosecution on 10 August 1999. Instead for counsel to 
						have it relisted expeditiously he did not do so until 22 
						March 2001 when in the middle of cross-examination of 
						the respondent in assessment of damages, he by oral 
						application sought to have his motion relisted. Counsel 
						for the respondent objected that it was procedurally 
						wrong and the court rightly upheld the objection. 
						Counsel for the appellant could have asked for 
						adjournment to file the appropriate motion for 
						relistment of his original motion. This he failed to do 
						and he is now saying there was a mistrial.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Indeed, as could be 
						observed from the record, the only defence the appellant 
						disclosed in his affidavit in support of his motion to 
						set aside the interlocutory judgment and for leave to 
						file a defence out of time, was that, the respondent was 
						not their employee. This is the only defence that 
						counsel mentioned in his statement of case as well. From 
						the evidence on record the respondent was a casual 
						labourer with a pass from the appellant to give him 
						access to the harbour. He had been working for the 
						appellant in various capacities from 1974 to 1996 when 
						he got injured from a wooden plank which fell from a 
						container he was working on in the appellant's cocoa 
						shed at the harbour. The fact that the respondent was a 
						casual labourer of the appellant does not absolve the 
						latter from any liability from injuries sustained on his 
						premises. The law, whether at common law or statute law, 
						imposes a duty of care on an employer towards his 
						employees, whether casual or permanent staff. Lord 
						Wright described this duty of care in the case of Wilson 
						&amp; Clyde Coal Co., Ltd. vrs. English[1938] A.C. 57 at 
						p.84,HL. thus:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;I think the whole 
						course of authority consistently recognizes a duty which 
						rests on the employer and which is personal to the 
						employer, to take reasonable care for the safety of his 
						workmen, whether the employer be an individual, a firm, 
						or a company, and whether or not the employer takes any 
						share in the conduct of the operations. The obligation 
						is threefold, as I have explained (the provision of a 
						competent staff of men, adequate material and a proper 
						system of effective supervision.)&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Factories, Offices 
						and Shops Act, 1970 (Act 328), makes provision among 
						other things for the health, welfare and safety of 
						persons employed in factories, offices and shops. The 
						Act does not make any distinction between casual and 
						permanent workers.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is only under the 
						Workmen Compensation Act, 1963 (Act 174) that the 
						provisions do not apply to casual labourers. The new 
						Labour Act seeks to protect casual workers from being 
						casual workers indefinitely as happened in this case 
						where the respondent was a casual worker of the 
						appellant from 1974 to 1996.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Consequently the 
						defence that the appellant had wanted to put up, that, 
						the respondent was not an employee but a casual labourer 
						cannot absolve them form the duty of care that an 
						employer owes to all workers on his premises. Even if 
						the respondent was an independent contractor which I 
						believe not, the appellant is not absolved from 
						liability.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I do not propose to 
						enter into any dialogue on this duty of care of an 
						employer towards his employees as this point was never 
						raised by the appellant at the trial nor in this appeal, 
						except to mention two Ghanaian cases in which this point 
						and other English cases were considered. They are the 
						cases of Issah vrs. Mim Timber Co. Ltd. [1980] GLR 430, 
						and Korley vrs. State Construction Corporation [1982-83] 
						GLR 576.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There is one further 
						comment I wish to make on this point. In her judgment, 
						the trial judge held that 'the defendant is vicariously 
						liable'. This is an error as the injury was not caused 
						by the negligence of a co-worker in the course of his 
						employment to render the employer vicariously liable. In 
						the case before us the respondent's complaint was simply 
						that, his employer did not provide adequate safety 
						materials and proper lighting and as a result he got 
						injured. A breach of this duty is actionable. As this 
						was not contested the trial judge was right in holding 
						the appellant liable. The appeal on this ground also 
						fails.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The next ground of 
						appeal was that the damages of ¢30 million awarded was 
						wrong in law and excessive. I do not find any merit in 
						this ground of appeal. The respondent was injured in the 
						right eye and this subsequently led to the total loss of 
						his sight in that eye, and the permanent disability was 
						assessed at 50% which in my estimation was quite high. 
						In cases of personal injuries the normal heads of 
						damages are for disability, disfigurement, loss of 
						amenities of life and pain and suffering. The trial 
						judge in her judgment did not specify the particular 
						head of damages but merely awarded a lump sum of ¢30 
						million. I however do not think the award was excessive, 
						and it must therefore be undisturbed. The appeal on this 
						ground also fails.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The last ground of 
						appeal canvassed was the additional ground of appeal 
						that the motion ex parte for abridgement of time for 
						assessment of damages was procedurally wrong and 
						therefore null and void since at the time the 
						application was made the defendant/appellant had entered 
						appearance which was on the docket. Counsel therefore 
						concluded that all proceedings thereafter were null and 
						void. Counsel is correct on the point that the motion 
						for abridgement of time ought to have been on notice 
						since the appellant had entered appearance then. In any 
						event, the hearing of the assessment of damages did not 
						come on at the abridged time, and the appellant through 
						his counsel participated in the hearing of evidence for 
						the assessment of damages on the subsequent hearing 
						dates. In my opinion therefore the abridgement of time 
						did not occasion any miscarriage of justice and it did 
						not render the proceedings null and void. This ground of 
						appeal is also misconceived and must therefore fail.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						STATEMENT OF DEFENCE OUT OF TIME&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This motion was fixed 
						for hearing on 14th July 1999, on account of the 
						Defendant/Appellant's motion when the case was called on 
						16/6/99 for the assessment of damages the court had to 
						adjourn the case to 14th July 1999. On 14/7/99 both

						the court deferred hearing to 10th August 1999. On 
						10/8/99 the parties were assent. However the 
						Plaintiff/Respondent's counsel was present but not the 
						Defendant/ Appellant's counsel. The court struck out the 
						Defendant/Appellant's motion for want of prosecution. 
						The Court ordered a hearing notice to be served on the 
						Defendant/Appellant for the assessment of damages to be 
						taken on 20th august 1999. Subsequently on 29/11/99, 
						30/3/2000, 24/5/2001 and 19/7/2000 the parties and their 
						counsel failed to attend court for the assessment to be

						for both parties appeared in court together for the 
						assessment to be taken. In the course of his 
						cross-examination of the Plaintiff/Respondent on 22nd 
						March 2001, counsel for the Defendant/Appellant in his 
						shiftless manner sought through a casual oral 
						application to be granted leave to re-list his earlier 
						motion on notice to set aside the very judgment which is 
						the judgment of this appeal which had long ago been 
						struck out for want of prosecution on 16th June 1999. 
						This is how he made his oral application:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;in the interest of 
						justice, this court is to grant us leave to re-list our 
						motion&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel for the 
						Plaintiff/Respondent objected to the application on 
						ground of procedural defect and the court rightly upheld 
						the objection.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">An application of this 
						nature should have been brought under Order 52(1) of the 
						High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954 (LN 140A). It 
						reads:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

						to a Judge in Court, shall be made by motion.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Defendant/Appellant 
						had every chance to defend the Plaintiff/Respondent's 
						action but it missed out on the opportunity. It never 
						even bothered to file any statement of Defence after it 
						had entered an ordinary appearance, though belatedly. 
						Ultimately after series of adjournments the trial court 
						took evidence from the Plaintiff/Respondent with 
						participation of the Defendant/Appellant on the 
						assessment of damages and awarded a Thirty Million Cedis 
						(¢30,000,000.00) damages as a lump sum compensation to 
						the Plaintiff/Respondent for the physical injury he 
						sustained on his right eye resulting in total blindness 
						in the injured eye. It was against this judgment and 
						order of the trial court that the Defendant/ Appellant 
						has appealed on the following five grounds:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(a) The trial was a 
						mistrial or non trial or both.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(b) The learned trial 
						judge did not allow the medical report tendered by the 
						Plaintiff to be subjected to cross-examination as the 
						Plaintiff did not call the medical officer who was said 
						to have issued the medical report.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(c) The trial learned 
						Judge did not allow or consider the defence of the 
						Defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(d) The damages 
						awarded were wrong in law and too excessive.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(e) The Motion 
						Ex-parte for Abridgement of Time for the Assessment of 
						Damages was procedurally wrong, and therefore null and 
						voice since at the time the application was made the 
						Defendant/Appellant had entered appearance which was on 
						the docket.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In arguing the appeal 
						in the Statement of Case appellant counsel lumped 
						together grounds (a), (b) and (c). The substance of his 
						argument scanty stated was that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The whole proceedings 
						were a non-trial&#8221; on the contention that the medical 
						officer the author of exhibit B was not called to give 
						evidence and he was not cross-examined on exhibit B,</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(ii) That on 18th May 
						2001, the court should not have called upon the 
						Plaintiff/Respondent to open his case in the absence of 
						the Defendant/Appellant and his counsel,</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(iii) That &quot;The 
						Defence was not allowed to make its case both by 
						pleadings and by defence&quot;, and</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(iv) &quot;That written 
						address is not reflected in the Record. . . the counsel 
						for the Plaintiff may not have filed any address hence 
						no record, but what about the Defendant?&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel seemed to be 
						oblivious of the fact that the appellant never went 
						beyond the process of filing an ordinary appearance and 
						that at the time that this process was filed judgment in 
						default of appearance had already been entered against 
						him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After series of 
						indulgences in the nature of adjournment granted by 
						trial court because neither the appellant not its 
						counsel ever showed up in court. The 
						Defendant/Appellant's motion to have default judgment 
						set aside and leave to file defence out of time was 
						struck out for want of prosecution. No further proper 
						efforts was made by the appellant to repeat the motion. 
						The Defendant/Appellant never filed any defence which as 
						it is being alleged the trial court failed to consider.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">One the issue of the 
						medical officer not made available to be cross-examined 
						on exhibit B, the medical report on the state of the 
						Respondent's right eye there was nothing on the face of 
						exhibit B which needs clarification. The probative 
						evidence that this document purports to give is clearly 
						stated in exhibit B. The relevant fact in this document 
						is that as a result of a plank hitting the 
						Plaintiff/Respondent at his work place in the course of 
						his employment he had suffered a total blindness in his 
						right eye.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 
						Plaintiff/Respondent himself was in court; the court and 
						the Defendant/ Appellant's counsel saw him. The 
						Defendant/Appellant&#8217;s counsel had the opportunity to see 
						and observe the Plaintiff/Respondent in court. He never 
						disputed the fact that the Plaintiff/Respondent had 
						suffered such a mishap and that the loss of his vision 
						in the right eye occurred in the course of his 
						employment in the appellant's business. The purpose of 
						cross-examination, inter alia, is to illuminate and trim 
						off the evidence of the opposing party so as to lay bare 
						the truth or falsehood of what has been said in evidence 
						by the opposing party. It is not imperative that a 
						witness or party must be cross-examined. The fact that a 
						witness was not cross-examined baring any fetters of 
						control and inhibition from the court, would in no way 
						derogate from the legalities of the legal proceedings at 
						a trial. In fact exhibit B served as one but not the 
						only factor which the trial court considered in 
						determining the credibility of the witness. The absence 
						of exhibit B would have had no debilitating effect on 
						the Plaintiff/ Respondent's case. The three grounds of 
						appeal namely, (a), (b) and (c) have not been 
						persuasively and creditably canvassed and they are 
						dismissed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 4th ground of 
						appeal is &quot;(d) the damages awarded were wrong in law and 
						too excessive.&quot; Again in a lackadaisical manner the 
						appellant's counsel did not say much. His argument was 
						composed in a sixteen-line prose with virtually no 
						reasons why in his view the award of ¢30 million 
						compensatory damages was &quot;wrong in law and excessive.&quot; 
						The full gist of his argument is contained in these two 
						sentences in the appellant's unnumbered statement of 
						case:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The Judge did not 
						elaborate on why the Defendant was vicariously liable 
						... One is at a loss to know what principles of damages 
						flowing from TORT under the common law the trial Judge 
						applied.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is true the judge 
						did not specify upon what heads of damages he proceeded 
						to award the ¢30 Million damages but this could not 
						preclude him from awarding damages against the appellant 
						for the loss of the employee's right vision. Under 
						common law an employer is enjoined to take reasonable 
						care not to subject his employees to unnecessary risk. 
						Every work carries some risk and the more obvious the 
						danger the more likely the law is to impose liability on 
						the employer for failing to prevent the accident. The 
						Plaintiff/Respondent, a carpenter by profession, was 
						assigned by the Defendant/Appellant on its business 
						operations of fixing wooden clamps on bagged cocoa beans 
						at the cocoa shed at the Tema Port. It was in the course 
						of executing this work that a plank hit him on the right 
						eye resulting in the total loss of his vision. If the 
						Defendant/Applicant had provided his employee, the 
						Plaintiff/Respondent, with a protective eye covering as 
						it was reasonably foreseeable that in the course of 
						fixing the clamp a plank or nail might fly off to injure 
						the worker he would have acted within his common law 
						duty of taking reasonable care not to subject his 
						employee to unnecessary risk. This the appellant did not 
						do. The failure to provide a reasonably safe system of 
						work made the Plaintiff/Respondent a foreseeable victim 
						of appellant's negligence. It was on the basis of this 
						that the trial Judge awarded a lump sum compensation of 
						¢30 Million. Denning L. J. in Christmas v General 
						cleaning Contractors LD. &amp; Caledonian Club Trust LD. 
						(195) 1 K.B. 141 at 149 has this to say regarding the 
						common law requirement of an employer taking reasonable 
						care for the safety of his employees in the following 
						words:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;if employers employ 
						men on... dangerous work for their own benefit, they 
						must take proper steps to protect them, even if they are 
						expensive. If they cannot afford to provide adequate 
						safeguards, then they should not ask them to do it at 
						all. It is not worth the risk.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The eye is such a vital 
						party of a person that the loss of it should be 
						adequately compensated for. The ¢30 Million awarded is 
						not an unreasonable sum and it should not be varied 
						downward.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Before I come to the 
						next ground of appeal, I would want to make an 
						observation. Even though no formal letter of appointment 
						was tendered in evidence it can't be denied that there 
						was a consensual agreement between the 
						Defendant/Appellant and the Plaintiff/Respondent giving 
						rise to employer-employee relationship between them. The 
						work that the Plaintiff/Respondent did formed an 
						integral part of the business of the appellant. His time 
						belonged to the Defendant/Applicant who appointed a 
						Supervisor over him (Plaintiff/Respondent) to oversee 
						his work and he was on the regular pay roll of the 
						appellant. Besides there is exhibit A signed by the 
						operations Manager of the Defendant/Appellant in which 
						the Plaintiff/Respondent is described alongside 18 
						others as &quot;Pool Casual Clerks&quot; of the 
						Defendant/Appellant. These factors point to fact that he 
						Plaintiff/Respondent was an employee of the 
						Defendant/Appellant and not an independent contractor.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There is nothing much 
						that can be said in support of the last ground of 
						appeal. It is perhaps precisely for this that counsel 
						could not advance any reason apart from what appears in 
						the whole argument for this last ground contained in 
						only two sentences thus:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;It is my submission 
						that the procedure in bringing the date forward for the 
						assessment of damages was procedurally wrong and 
						rendered all proceedings thereafter null and void. The 
						reason for this contention is that after a party has 
						entered appearance to a writ any further proceedings/ 
						processes must be on Notice and not ex-parte&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Admittedly, the motion 
						for the abridgement of the scheduled date for the 
						assessment of damages should have been by motion on 
						notice and not ex-parte. The Defendant/Applicant's 
						counsel compromised his right to objection of the 
						ex-prate motion irregularly filed by participating in 
						the assessment hearing without raising an objection. By 
						so doing he took fresh step in, overlooking the 
						irregularity within the spirit and intent of order 70 rr 
						1 and 2 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 1954 
						and it is too late for him to complain now.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The rules read:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;1. Non-compliance with 
						any of these Rules, or with any rule of practice for the 
						time being in force, shall not render any proceedings 
						void unless the court or Judge shall so direct....</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;2. No application to 
						set aside any proceeding for irregularity shall be 
						allowed unless made within reasonable time, nor if the 
						party applying has taken any fresh step after knowledge 
						of the irregularity&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This ground also fails. 
						The whole appeal fails. The judgment and the order 
						directed against the Defendant/Appellant to make a lump 
						sum compensation of ¢30 million to the 
						Plaintiff/Respondent are upheld.</span></p>
