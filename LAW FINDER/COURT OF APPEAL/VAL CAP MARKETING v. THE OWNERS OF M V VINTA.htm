												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												LAMPTEY, JA:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On 12th August 1993, Solicitors 
												acting for Val Cap Marketing 
												took out a writ of summons in 
												the High Court, Accra against 
												the Owners of M/V Vinta and 
												claimed against the owners the 
												reliefs endorsed on the writ of 
												summons. The address Val Cap 
												provided for service of process 
												on the Owners was stated as 
												&quot;Port of Tema Ghana&quot;. At the 
												time of filing the writ of 
												summons the solicitors for Val 
												Cap filed a motion ex-parte 
												supported by affidavit by which 
												Val Cap sought an order for a 
												warrant for the arrest of the 
												vessel M/V Vinta. By their 
												action Val Cap claimed as 
												follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The sum of US. $70,543.82 being 
												principal and interest as at 
												10th August 1993 being the cost 
												of 300.02 metric tonnes of 
												intermediate fuel oil sold and 
												delivered to the defendants&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The writ of summons and the 
												statement of claim were served 
												on one Captain Praveen Malham on 
												13th September 1993 at Tema 
												Harbour.&nbsp; Solicitors acting for 
												the Owners filed a statement of 
												defence by which the Owners 
												challenged and disputed the 
												capacity of Val Cap to sue 
												them.&nbsp; In the statement of 
												defence the owners pleaded that 
												they had not entered into any 
												contract with Val Cap:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;for the sale and delivery of 
												fuel oil and further that there 
												was no such contract between the 
												parties and that the action was 
												statute-barred.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the circumstances the 
												solicitors of the Owners filed a 
												motion on notice pursuant to Q. 
												25 rr 2, 3 &amp; 4 and also invoked 
												the inherent jurisdiction of the 
												court to dismiss the action of 
												Val Cap. The application was 
												supported by an affidavit to 
												which was annexed a &quot;book&quot; 
												running into 284 pages and 
												labelled &quot;affidavit of Robert S. 
												Delange &quot;.&nbsp; As was to be 
												expected, Val Cap filed an 
												affidavit in opposition against 
												the dismissal of its action. The 
												trial court heard the 
												application on its merits.&nbsp;&nbsp; It 
												dismissed the application of the 
												Owners and entered judgment for 
												Val Cap for the amount endorsed 
												on the writ of summons. The 
												Owners were aggrieved by the 
												judgment and appealed to this 
												court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I must confess that this appeal 
												caused me great deal of anxiety 
												hence we called upon counsel for 
												Val Cap to argue as a 
												preliminary issue of law the 
												procedure followed by the trial 
												court, in particular, whether or 
												not the trial judge was right in 
												law when he entered judgment for 
												Val Cap at that stage of the 
												proceedings. In his written 
												statement of case on the above 
												issue, counsel for Val Cap 
												questioned the authority of this 
												court to place such a burden and 
												obligation on him since he was 
												counsel for the respondent, Val 
												Cap. In answer to the query of 
												counsel for Val Cap, my short 
												answer is that an appeal is a 
												re-hearing of the case on appeal 
												on the merits. I further refer 
												to and rely on Rule 32 (1) &amp; (2) 
												of C.I. 19.&nbsp; This rule 
												provides:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) &quot;2 The powers of the Court 
												may be exercised not 
												withstanding that the appellant 
												may have asked that part only of 
												a decision be reversed . . . And 
												may also be exercised in favour 
												of all or any of the respondents 
												or parties although they have 
												not appealed from or complained 
												of the decision&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In my opinion, the Rule gives to 
												the appellate court power, suo 
												moto, to invite counsel's 
												opinion on the appropriate law 
												and rules of court, if and when 
												the circumstances of the 
												particular case demanded that 
												the appellate court intervened 
												in the proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus in 
												the case of In Re Cole (Dec) 
												Codjoe v. Cole (1977) 2 GLR 305 
												at 308, Archer JA. (as he then 
												was) in the course of his 
												judgment applied that rule as 
												the following passage</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												demonstrated and illustrated:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; When the hearing of the appeal 
												commenced, we cut short the 
												argument relied upon by the 
												appellants' learned counsel and 
												we invited learned counsel for 
												the respondent to address us on 
												the correctness of the judgment 
												of the court below in view of 
												the over- whelming evidence in 
												favour of the validity of the 
												will.&quot; My short answer to the 
												query of counsel for Val Cap is 
												that this court has the power it 
												exercised. We invited counsel 
												for Val Cap to satisfy us that 
												the application to dismiss the 
												action of Val Cap was 
												justifiable and supportable in 
												law, that is to say according to 
												the rules of court an 
												application may be competently 
												dealt with:&#8212; (1) pursuant to O. 
												25 rr 2, 3 &amp; 4, and (2) in the 
												exercise of the inherent 
												jurisdiction of the High Court.&nbsp; 
												If the application was dismissed 
												as incompetent, was the 
												plaintiff, Val Cap entitled to 
												judgment without more. </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the first issue raised by the 
												court, counsel for Val Cap 
												submitted that if the 
												application was to be considered 
												pursuant to O. 25 rr 2, 3 &amp; 4 
												then it was wrong to attach or 
												annex affidavit evidence to the 
												motion paper.&nbsp; He conceded 
												further that the trial court was 
												not permitted to consider and 
												examine affidavit evidence in 
												determining the application.&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
												entirely agree with the 
												statement of the law by counsel 
												for Val Cap. What this means is 
												that the trial judge must 
												consider and determine the 
												application without relying on 
												or referring to and using the 
												affidavits annexed to the 
												application if he exercised the 
												powers pursuant to O. 25 rr 2, 3 
												&amp; 4. The trial judge did not 
												purport to exercise the powers 
												granted him under O 25 rr 2,3, 
												and 4. The trial judge 
												considered and determined the 
												application in exercise of the 
												inherent jurisdiction of the 
												court, counsel for Val Cap 
												contended that the trial judge 
												was right in the circumstances 
												of this case to do so to enable 
												him to dispose of the case and 
												give final judgment without 
												more. He cited the case of Bank 
												of West Africa v Holbrock (1966) 
												G.L.R. 164 and the English case 
												of Remmington v. Scoles (1995-9) 
												All E R 117.&nbsp;&nbsp; See also 
												Appenteng &amp; ors v. Bank of West 
												Africa Ltd. &amp; ors. (1961) G.L.R. 
												196.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I must now consider the matters 
												before the trial court in the 
												light of what the rules of court 
												and the law permitted and 
												prescribed. First O. 25 rr 2 &amp; 
												3. These provide:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;2. Any party shall be entitled 
												to raise by his pleadings any 
												point of law, and any point so 
												raised shall be disposed of by 
												the judge who tries the cause at 
												or after the trial . . . on 
												application by either party.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												The same may be set down for 
												hearing.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3. If in the opinion of the 
												judge the decision on such a 
												point of law substantially 
												disposes of the whole action&nbsp; . 
												. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
												the judge may thereupon dismiss 
												the action . . . . . . . . . . . 
												. . . . &#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is plain and clear that an 
												application based on O. 25 rr 2 
												&amp; 3 must be founded only on the 
												pleadings before the court. 
												Further that a point of law must 
												be raised on the pleadings for 
												consideration and determination 
												by the court. It must be pointed 
												out that affidavit or other 
												evidence is out-lawed by the 
												rule.&nbsp;&nbsp; I must draw attention to 
												the pleadings before the court 
												at the date of filing of the 
												motion to dismiss the instant 
												action. At that date, the 
												pleadings before the court 
												were:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) &quot;the writ of summons, (2) 
												the statement of claim and (3) 
												the statement of defence. Val 
												Cap had not filed (1) a reply 
												and (2) summons for directions.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What was the point of law that 
												the Owners raised? One of the 
												issues of law raised was stated 
												at head (2) as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;2. That defendants have not 
												entered into any contract with 
												plaintiffs&#8221; In the statement of 
												defence at paragraph 9 the 
												Owners raised this issue of law, 
												namely, whether or not there was 
												a contract between the parties 
												before the court. In his 
												affidavit in opposition to the 
												application one Gabriel Amedume 
												Atuglinyi did not advert to the 
												serious issue of law raised by 
												the owners. His affidavit 
												consisted of 3 paragraphs: These 
												were:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;(1)&nbsp; . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
												. . . . . . . . . . . that I 
												have personal knowledge of facts 
												in this matter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . . .. 
												. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
												. . . . . I have been authorized 
												to depose to this affidavit.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
												. . . . . . . . . . . . Counsel 
												for the plaintiffs will seek 
												leave . . . . . . . . . . to 
												refer to the pleadings and to 
												produce the relevant applicable 
												law.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3) Wherefore I swear to this 
												affidavit&quot;. The simple issue 
												raised for determination by the 
												trial court as disclosed by the 
												application of the Owners was 
												whether or not there was in 
												existence at the date of filing 
												the writ of summons a contract 
												between Val Cap (1) and the 
												Owners (2) for the supply and 
												delivery of oil amounting to US 
												$70.453.02 entered into on 28th 
												April 1989&quot; The Owners denied 
												there was such a contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
												must draw attention to the 
												record which showed that at the 
												date of the hearing of the 
												motion to dismiss the action of 
												Val Cap, that Company, by it 
												Solicitors had filed a Reply to 
												the statement of defence.&nbsp; A 
												careful and critical examination 
												of paragraphs 2, 3, &amp; 4 shows 
												that a contract was not entered 
												into between Val Cap and the 
												Owners on 28th April 1989. This 
												averment was contrary to what 
												was pleaded in the statement of 
												claim. Since Val Cap had sued on 
												a non-existing contract and had 
												not sought leave to amend its 
												statement of claim to reflect 
												the contract dated 28th April 
												1989 disclosed in the Reply of 
												Val Cap to the statement of 
												defense, the trial judge's plain 
												and simple duty was to uphold 
												the objection in limine and 
												dismiss the action of Val Cap by 
												which it sought reliefs under a 
												non-existing contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; He 
												failed to do this.&nbsp;&nbsp; He gravely 
												erred in law in dismissing the 
												application of the Owners by his 
												Ruling.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There can be no doubt that by 
												paragraphs 2, 3 &amp; 4 of the Reply 
												to the statement of defence, Val 
												Cap substantially changed the 
												case and claim it put forward in 
												its writ of summons and 
												statement of claim before the 
												court. By the Reply to the 
												statement of defense Val Cap put 
												forward a new case against the

												examined them together with the

												plainly wrong in law in 
												dismissing the application by 
												the Owners.&nbsp; He was&nbsp; wrong in

												different from the claim

												the Reply to the statement of

												triable issues, which called for 
												a hearing of the case on the

												of the application by the Owners 
												was unwarranted and not 
												supportable in law.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of 
												the matters raised on the 
												pleadings may be stated here:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1)&nbsp; who are parties to the 
												assignment</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) is the debt the subject 
												matter of the claim statute 
												barred; and</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3) which contract is the 
												subject matter of this suit? I 
												have drawn attention to some 
												only of the matters raised on 
												the pleadings to show and 
												demonstrate that the trial judge 
												misdirected himself on the issue 
												of law raised on the motion by 
												the Owners seeking an order to 
												dismiss the action.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Was the trial judge right in 
												exercising his powers under the 
												inherent jurisdiction to dismiss 
												the application by the Owners? 
												The trial judge was entitled to 
												look at and examine affidavit 
												evidence to enable him determine 
												the application when exercising 
												the inherent jurisdiction of the 
												court.&nbsp; I must point out that in 
												performing this function and 
												discharging this duty the trial 
												judge was enjoined to restrict 
												himself to evidence which prove 
												and establish the pleadings 
												before him; in other words, the 
												affidavit evidence must</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												amplify and provide further and 
												better particulars of what each 
												party had pleaded.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason 
												for this rule is that a party is 
												bound by their pleadings.&nbsp; This 
												means that affidavit evidence, 
												which is inconsistent, 
												extraneous and unconnected with 
												the pleadings must be rejected 
												and ignored by the trial judge. 
												This is illustrated by the cases 
												cited to us by counsel for Val 
												Cap, namely, the English case of 
												Burrows v. Rhodes (1895-9) All E 
												R 117. At page 120 Grantham J. 
												stated as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; In this case we are asked to 
												determine whether on the 
												statement of claim as presented 
												to us . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
												. . . . . . . any cause of 
												action has been shown for which 
												an action is maintainable 
												according to English law. For 
												the purposes of our judgment, 
												this being a demurrer by the 
												defendants all the facts alleged 
												in the claim must be taken to be 
												true and admitted by the 
												defendants&quot;.&nbsp; The principle was 
												applied by&nbsp; Ollennu J. (as he 
												then was) in the case of 
												Appenteng &amp; ors v. Bank of West 
												Africa Ltd. &amp; ors (1961) GLR 196 
												at 199.&nbsp;&nbsp; As already pointed out 
												elsewhere in this judgment, the 
												claim of Val Cap was founded on 
												a contract dated 28th April 1989 
												between Val Cap (1) and the 
												Owners (2), The Owners denied 
												that there was such a contract 
												between the parties.&nbsp;&nbsp; The law 
												enjoined Val Cap to provide 
												affidavit evidence of the 
												contract it had pleaded to 
												enable the trial court to 
												exercise its inherent 
												jurisdiction.&nbsp; Val Cap did not 
												produce particulars of the 
												contract it pleaded.&nbsp; Val Cap 
												did not in its affidavit explain 
												its inability to produce the 
												&quot;contract document&quot; to the trial 
												court. Val Cap did not offer any 
												evidence to satisfy the trial 
												court that on 28th April 1989 it 
												entered into a contract with the 
												Owners.&nbsp; In these circumstances, 
												the application to dismiss the 
												action of Val Cap ought to have 
												succeeded. With respect to the 
												trial judge, he misdirected 
												himself on the real issue in&nbsp; 
												controversy raised in the 
												application before him. The 
												Owners had moved the court under 
												head (2) as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) &quot;That the defendants have 
												not entered into any contract 
												with the plaintiffs.&quot; There was 
												no evidence from Val Cap in 
												answer to this statement of 
												fact. The judge delivered 
												himself as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; It is not in dispute that the 
												vessel M/V Vinta which was not 
												resident in Texas after being 
												supplied with fuel left the 
												jurisdiction of the state of 
												Texas and never returned.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												What was the evidence before the 
												trial court, which led to this 
												finding of fact, namely, that it 
												was at the request of the Owners 
												that fuel was supplied to their 
												vessel?&nbsp; What was the evidence 
												that Val Cap had supplied fuel 
												to the Owners?&nbsp; How did the 
												trial judge inform himself that 
												the vessel left Texas?&nbsp; I have 
												drawn attention to some only of 
												the above matters in order to 
												demonstrate and establish that 
												the claim of Val Cap which was 
												founded on the contract it 
												pleaded in the statement of 
												claim, even if maintainable 
												called for a hearing on the 
												merits and not summarily 
												disposed of in exercise of the 
												inherent jurisdiction of the 
												court.&nbsp; The trial judge 
												purported to rely on untested 
												pieces of affidavit evidence and 
												came to the conclusion he did.&nbsp; 
												In the circumstances of this 
												case, the trial judge erred in 
												law in purporting to and 
												exercising the inherent 
												jurisdiction of the court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												To continue with the mistakes of 
												the trial judge, I reproduce the 
												passage following:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Even though there is no dispute 
												that the plaintiffs supplied 
												fuel to the vessel M/V Vinta the 
												defendants have contended that 
												they have not entered into a 
												contractual relationship with 
												the plaintiffs.&nbsp; What defendants 
												imply is that in supplying fuel 
												to the vessel the plaintiffs 
												dealt with the charterers and 
												not themselves. That brings us 
												to the consideration of the 
												issue of maritime lien.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I am amazed that the trial judge 
												raised the issue of maritime 
												lien, suo moto, in considering a 
												very simple application before 
												him. On the face of the 
												pleadings, the issue of maritime 
												lien had not been raised by the 
												parties because none was 
												pleaded. What was raised was the 
												issue whether or not there was a 
												contract between the parties? 
												The trial judge erred in the 
												view he took of the application 
												before him.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I now deal with head (3) on the 
												motion paper namely:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;3. That the charter or 
												certificate or authority of the 
												plaintiffs having been forfeited 
												by the Government of the State 
												of Texas the plaintiffs lack 
												capacity to sue as the 
												plaintiffs are not entitled to 
												operate&#8221;. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I have carefully read the 
												pleadings and I have not been 
												able to find any averment that 
												the plaintiffs purported to sue 
												pursuant to a charter or 
												certificate or authority.&nbsp; The 
												trial judge should have struck 
												out head (3) as not warranted by 
												the pleadings before the court. 
												The simple reason in support of 
												this conclusion is that Val Cap 
												did not purport to sue in a 
												capacity other that disclosed on 
												the pleadings.&nbsp; At paragraph 1 
												of the statement of claim 
												appears the following:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;1. At all material time the 
												plaintiffs are marine bunkers 
												doing business in the United 
												State of America&quot; This averment 
												is capable of proof by evidence. 
												The Owners denied paragraph 1 of 
												the statement of claim by their 
												paragraph 1 of the statement of 
												defence. The denial was 
												explained in paragraphs 2, 4 &amp; 8 
												of the statement of defence.&nbsp; 
												The Owners in law thus put Val 
												Cap to strict proof of the truth 
												of the pleading by evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												The court can only determine and 
												rule on the issue raised after 
												it had considered and examining 
												affidavit evidence from Val Cap 
												in proof of the pleading at 
												paragraph 1 of the statement of 
												claim.&nbsp; The Ruling of the trial 
												judge was noticeably silent on 
												this issue. In my opinion, the 
												failure of the trial judge to 
												make a finding on that issue 
												under head (3) on the notice of 
												motion is fatal to the decision 
												he reached on the application.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												The trial judge was in law 
												enjoined to rule whether or not 
												the Owners had made a case under 
												head (3) by affidavit evidence. 
												The decision dismissing the 
												application cannot be supported 
												in law for thus further reason.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Perhaps another example to show 
												and prove that the trial judge 
												erred in law in exercising the 
												inherent jurisdiction of the 
												court will be found from the 
												passage following:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;In the instant case the 
												defendants have not demonstrated 
												to the court that the&nbsp; 
												presumption that arose when the 
												plaintiffs supplied fuel to the 
												vessel M/V Vinta has been 
												successfully rebutted for the 
												simple reason that the 
												defendants have not been able to 
												establish to the satisfaction of 
												the court that the plaintiffs 
												looked solely to the personal 
												credit of the charterers . . . . 
												&#8221; With respect to the trial 
												judge, if the above matters were 
												raised on the face of the 
												pleadings, which is not the case 
												in this appeal, it was clear 
												that the application before the 
												court was not eminently suitable 
												to be fought on affidavit 
												evidence.&nbsp; The court can only 
												feel satisfied, if the court 
												permitted the matters raised to 
												be proved and established in a 
												hearing and a trial on the 
												merits.&nbsp; The exercise of its 
												inherent jurisdiction was 
												unwarranted and cannot be 
												supported in law.&nbsp; The trial 
												judge was enjoined to examine 
												and consider the affidavit 
												evidence, which sought to prove 
												and establish the contract 
												pleaded by Val Cap in the 
												statement of claim.&nbsp;&nbsp; Affidavit 
												evidence must prove the contract 
												pleaded strictly.&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial 
												judge did not rule on this 
												issue.&nbsp; His failure to do so was 
												fatal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appeal raised another 
												disquieting and unwarranted 
												admission of inadmissible 
												evidence.&nbsp; I refer specifically 
												to the document running into 285 
												pages and annexed and labelled 
												&#8220;affidavit of Robert S. 
												Delange.&#8221;&nbsp; This document does 
												not comply with the rule on 
												affidavit evidence.&nbsp; It will be 
												otiose in this judgment to state 
												the relevant rules on affidavit 
												evidence.&nbsp; It is more profitable 
												and helpful if reproduce a few 
												only of the contents of the 
												offending document:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;I have had the opportunity to 
												review the opinion of the High 
												Court of Justice in Accra of 
												11th July 1994 relating to the 
												assertion of a maritime lien 
												against the M/V Vinta on or 
												about the 11th August 1993&#8221;.&nbsp; 
												The declarant continued on his 
												affidavit to use expressions 
												such as:&#8212; &#8220;it is my 
												understanding&#8221; &#8220;I have been 
												asked by the owners&#8221;? &#8220;it is 
												evidence from a reading . . . . 
												. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
												. .of the High Court Accra.&#8221; in 
												the said affidavit file by the 
												Owners.&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial judge 
												gravely erred in law in 
												accepting the offending 
												&#8220;affidavit&#8221;&nbsp; The trial judge . . 
												. . . . . . . . . . . . .&nbsp; . . . 
												. . . of Delange as an affidavit 
												properly so called.&nbsp; The trial 
												judge fell into serious error 
												when he referred to and relied 
												on the &#8220;affidavit&#8221; of Delange as 
												admissible affidavit evidence. 
												That the trial judge did rely on 
												the offending and inadmissible 
												evidence is illustrated by a 
												number of passages following 
												from his Ruling.&nbsp; A few sample 
												quotations may suffice to 
												illustrate the complaint I have 
												made as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The affidavit of Delange 
												attached to defendant&#8217;s 
												supplementary affidavit . . . . 
												. . . . refers to Shoe baum 
												Admiralty and Maritime Law 
												Chapter 8 which records . . . . 
												. . . . .. at pages 252 and 
												253.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												When it is pointed out that the 
												simple issue for determination 
												by the trial judge was whether 
												or not there was in existence a 
												contract between Val Cap (1) and 
												the Owner (2) dated 28th April 
												1989, the unwarranted admission 
												of the affidavit of Delange is 
												made plain and clear.&nbsp; To 
												further illustrate my 
												observation that the trial judge 
												misdirected himself in admitting 
												and using the affidavit of 
												Delange.&nbsp; I reproduce the 
												passage following from the 
												Ruling appealed against.&nbsp; The 
												trial judge wrote this:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Another attachment to the 
												affidavit of Delange is 793 
												Federal Report 2nd Series whose 
												page 602 records the following 
												on maritime lien . . . . . . . . 
												. .&#8221; and conclude thus:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;to meet the burden, evidence 
												must be provided that would 
												permit the inference that the 
												supplier purposefully intended 
												to forego the lien.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It may be asked at this stage 
												why the trial judge did not 
												realise that the issues raised 
												were triable issues and further, 
												that affidavit evidence was 
												eminently unsuitable in 
												assisting him to exercise the 
												inherent jurisdiction of the 
												court.&nbsp; If find further support 
												for my opinion that the trial 
												judge erred in law when he 
												exercised his inherent 
												jurisdiction from the passage 
												following in the Ruling as 
												follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The defendants have contended 
												that the contract was between 
												the plaintiffs and the 
												charterers.&nbsp;&nbsp; For their 
												contention they relied on Exh. 
												B. . . . . . . &#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The first observation I must 
												make is that the matters stated 
												by the trial judge are not 
												supported by the statement of 
												defence, that is, the pleadings 
												on which the Court was moved.&nbsp; 
												The other observation is that if 
												what the trial judge stated 
												represented the true state of 
												the pleadings, the rules of 
												court enjoined the parties to 
												prove their respective claims in 
												a trial on the merits.&nbsp; The 
												issue raised namely, who are or 
												should be the proper parties in 
												the action is not one, which the 
												trial court could and should 
												determine in the exercise of its 
												inherent jurisdiction.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Again the trial judge, in the 
												course of his Ruling, wrote as 
												follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Another issue for determination 
												relates to the capacity of the 
												plaintiffs to sue.&#8221;&nbsp; This issue 
												is not one, which the court can 
												competently resolve by the 
												exercise of its inherent 
												jurisdiction.&nbsp; The trial judge 
												misdirected himself on the real 
												issue in controversy between the 
												parties; the real issue was 
												whether or not there was in 
												existence the contract pleaded 
												by Val Cap in its statement of 
												claim.&nbsp; The answer to this very 
												simple issue was provided in the 
												Reply filed by Val Cap in answer 
												to the statement of defence.&nbsp; 
												Val Cap unequivocally admitted 
												that there had never been in 
												existence the contract it had 
												pleaded in the statement of 
												claim.&nbsp; The trial judge was 
												enjoined in the circumstances to 
												grant and uphold the Owners 
												application and dismiss the 
												action of Val Cap which action 
												was founded and based on a 
												non-existing contract. The trial 
												judge failed to discharge this 
												simple duty.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was clearly 
												and plainly in error by his 
												Ruling.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel for the Owners argued 
												ground (4) on the notice of 
												additional grounds of appeal in 
												his statement of case. That 
												ground reads:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;4 the learned trial judge erred 
												in proceeding on an incurably 
												defective writ of summons which 
												rendered the entire proceedings 
												a nullity&quot;.&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In arguing this ground of appeal 
												he reproduced paragraph 7 of an 
												affidavit sworn to by one 
												Norbert Kwasivi Kudjawu thus:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; 7. That I am informed and 
												verily believe that the 
												defendant's vessel M/V Vinta 
												will dock at the Port of Tema on 
												or about the 16th August 1993 
												within the jurisdiction of this 
												Court.&quot; He contended that on 
												12th August 1993 when the writ 
												was filed and sealed the vessel 
												was outside the jurisdiction. He 
												contended that the affidavit 
												evidence showed that the Owners 
												carried on business outside the 
												jurisdiction. He submitted in 
												the circumstances that O.2 r4 
												enjoined Val Cap to seek and 
												obtain leave to serve the writ 
												of summons on the Owners and or 
												the vessel known to reside 
												outside the jurisdiction on 12th 
												August 1993 when the summons was 
												sealed.&nbsp; He cited the High Court 
												case of Lokko v. Lokko 
												(1989&#8212;1990) 1 GLR 96.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
												reply, counsel for Val Cap 
												submitted that the procedure 
												followed was permissible under 
												O2 r6 and therefore O2 r4 did 
												not apply in the instant case. 
												He submitted that where an 
												action is commenced against a 
												vessel the vessel is served 
												where it is found. On this he 
												relied on O9 p14. From the 
												evidence on record there is no 
												doubt that the writ of summons 
												was filed and sealed on 12th 
												August 1993. On the writ the 
												address for service on the 
												Owners was stated as &quot;Port of 
												Tema Ghana.&quot;&nbsp; This means and can 
												only mean that on the 12th 
												August 1993 the defendant 
												&quot;Owners of M/V Vinta&quot; would be 
												found at &quot;the Port of Tema 
												Ghana&quot; for service on them of 
												the writ. In admiralty action, 
												the mode of service is provided 
												at O9 r14 as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; 14. In Admiralty action the 
												service of a writ of summons or 
												warrant against ship freight or 
												cargo on board is to be effected 
												by nailing or affixing the 
												original writ or warrant for a 
												short time on the main mast, or 
												on the single mast of the vessel 
												and on taking off the process 
												leaving a true copy of it nailed 
												or fixed in its place&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">

												on the vessel or the owners the 
												vessel must be physically 
												present in the jurisdiction to 
												enable the serving officer to 
												affix the original writ for a 
												short time on the mast and 
												subsequently remove this and 
												replace it with a true and 
												certified copy. Proof of due 
												service pursuant to O9 r14 is 
												provided by O2 r6. Pursuant to 
												O2, r16 the serving bailiff must 
												complete Form 6 in Appendix A 
												Part I. At page 2 of the record 
												of appeal appears the 
												endorsement in proof of service 
												by Bailiff S.A. Tettey. The 
												endorsement did not conform with 
												the mandatory provision stated 
												in the rules to which I have 
												made reference. S.A. Tettey 
												served the writ on one captain 
												Praveen Malham on 6th September 
												1993 at Tema. He proved service 
												on 13th September 1993. The 
												bailiff was enjoined to prove 
												service within 3 days. See O9 
												r17 and r23.&nbsp; In this case S.A. 
												Tettey proved service after 3 
												days.&nbsp; S.A. Tettey did not affix 
												the writ on the mast of M/V 
												Vinta. The more serious 
												complaint was the physical and 
												actual location and position of 
												M/V Vinta on 12th August 1993.&nbsp; 
												The affidavit sworn to by 
												Solicitor for Val Cap, Mr. 
												Norbert Kudjawu clearly and 
												unequivocally showed that the 
												vessel M/V Vinta was not present 
												and had not docked at &quot;Tema Port 
												Ghana&quot; on 12th August 1993.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												Since the &quot;Owner&quot; were resident 
												outside the jurisdiction and 
												furthermore since the vessel M/N 
												Vinta was not within the 
												jurisdiction on 12th August 
												1993, O2 r4 enjoined Val Cap to 
												seek and obtain leave of the 
												Court to enable service on the 
												Owners. That rule provides</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;4. No writ of summons for 
												service or of which notice is to 
												be given out of the jurisdiction 
												shall be issued without the 
												leave of the Court or a 
												Judge&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the instant appeal the 
												affidavit evidence was that on 
												the 12th August 1993 neither the 
												Owners of the vessel nor the 
												vessel M/N Vinta were resident 
												at Tema nor would be found at 
												Tema. The address stated for 
												service was grossly misleading 
												and not factually correct. 
												Solicitor for Val Cap admitted 
												that the vessel M/V Vinta was on 
												the high seas and out of the 
												jurisdiction on the date the 
												writ was sealed.&nbsp; The writ was 
												therefore incompetent. The 
												proceedings were a nullity.&nbsp; I 
												allow the appeal.&nbsp; I set aside 
												the Ruling of the High Court 
												Accra.&nbsp; I do not think any 
												useful purpose would be served 
												if I deal with the entry of 
												judgment in favour of the Val 
												Cap except to state that the 
												trial judge gravely erred in law 
												in exercising his inherent 
												jurisdiction in the instant 
												case.&nbsp; I set aside the judgement 
												entered in favour of Val Cap.</span></p>

												JUSTICE OF APPEAL</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												WOOD. JA. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I do agree that the appeal must 
												succeed in part. The decision 
												giving judgment to plaintiff 
												ought to be set aside and case 
												remitted to trial for a hearing 
												on the merits for, I think the 
												trial judge erred in not 
												dismissing the claim.&nbsp; Although 
												no reply and summons for 
												direction had been filed at the 
												date of the application which 
												resulted in this appeal, that is 
												on the 26th of October 1998; it 
												is plain from the pleadings that 
												serious triable issues, both of 
												fact and law had been raised.&nbsp; 
												It is also equally pertinent to 
												note that those legal issues 
												could not have been resolved 
												without first determining those 
												factual issues connected 
												thereto.&nbsp; Happily, three of the 
												issues that arose from the 
												pleadings have actually been 
												clearly identified in the said 
												motion.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Whether or not the 
												contract upon which the 
												plaintiffs are suing is statute 
												barred.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or not the 
												defendants have entered into any 
												contract with the plaintiff.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3. Whether or not the plaintiffs 
												have capacity to sue.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Indeed, a quick reference to the 
												pleadings does put our minds in 
												no doubt that at the date of the 
												application, these and other 
												issues raise, do necessarily 
												demand that barring any valid 
												reasons, this case ought to 
												proceed to trial in the normal 
												way.&nbsp; In any case at the hearing 
												of the application to 13th 
												January 1994. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												So for example, the plaintiff 
												replied to the defence that 
												&quot;they have not entered into any 
												contract with the plaintiffs&quot; 
												and pleaded so follows.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2. In answer to par 2. of the 
												statement of defense, the 
												plaintiffs say that by a deed of 
												assignment dated 3rd June 1991 
												Val Cap Marketing lnc assigned 
												the debt, which is the subject 
												matter of this suit to best out 
												sales and services lnc.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3. The plaintiff under the 
												applicable law an assignee may 
												sue on the close in action in 
												the name of his assignor and the 
												assignee may present the suit in 
												any court including the 
												appellate Tribunals and the writ 
												need not show that the action is 
												for the assignees consent need 
												not be obtained.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												4.&nbsp; That the named plaintiff 
												being the assignor in only a 
												nominal party in whose name this 
												action is instituted by the 
												assignee; the party for whose 
												benefit this action is 
												instituted.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												None of these matters raised 
												herein have been said to be 
												objectionable and there is plea 
												that any of them ought to be 
												struck out.&nbsp; Properly they form 
												a very essential part of the 
												plaintiffs pleadings. What it 
												does show when examined 
												alongside the defense is that 
												there are serious matters in 
												contentions, which can only be 
												resolved by way of evidence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												One such other important issue 
												concerns the question of 
												interest. Why do I say so? The 
												plaintiffs pleaded by the 
												paragraphs 6 and 7 as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The said sum has attracted 
												interest at the rate of 1% per 
												month from the 29th April 1989 
												to the 10th August, totaling 
												$37,203.90 so that as at the 
												10th August 1993 the defendants 
												owe the plaintiffs the sum of % 
												$70,453.82.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The plaintiffs say that the said 
												sums shall continue to attract 
												interest at the rate of 1% per 
												month within the date of final 
												payment.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Now, apart from the defendants 
												general traverse they flatly 
												denied the facts averred by the 
												paragraph 9 as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; The defendants deny paragraphs 
												5, 6, and 7.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This means that whether interest 
												is payable, the rate, together 
												with the period within which the 
												interest is to run are all 
												disputed and evidence needed to 
												be led in proof of same.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It does therefore come as a 
												surprise that defendants 
												proceeded with a motion to 
												dismiss plaintiffs claim under 
												order 25 rules, 2, 3 and 4 and 
												the inherent jurisdiction of the 
												court on grounds stated as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												1.&nbsp; That the contract upon which 
												the plaintiff are suing is 
												statute barred.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2. That the defendants have not 
												entered into contract with the 
												plaintiffs.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3. That the charter or 
												certificate of authority of the 
												plaintiffs having been forfeited 
												by the government of the state 
												of Taxes the plaintiff lack 
												capacity to sue as the 
												plaintiffs are not entitled to 
												operate&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The relevant rules upon which 
												the application was brought 
												reads:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												25. &quot;Any party shall be entitled 
												to raise by his pleading any 
												point of law and any points so 
												raised shall be disposed of by 
												the judge who tries the cause at 
												or after the trial provided that 
												by consent of the parties or by 
												order of the Court or a judge on 
												the application of either party, 
												the same may be set down for 
												hearing and disposed of at any 
												time before the trial.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3.&nbsp;&nbsp; If in the opinion of the 
												Court or Judge the decision of 
												such point of law substantially 
												disposes of the whole action, or 
												of any distinct cause of action, 
												ground of defence, set off, 
												counter claim or reply therein, 
												the court or judge may thereupon 
												dismiss the action or make such 
												other order therein as may be 
												just.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												4. The court or a judge may 
												order any pleading to be shown 
												out on the ground that it 
												discloses no reasonable cause of 
												action or answer and in any such 
												case or in the case of the 
												action or defence being shown by 
												the pleadings to be frivolous or 
												vexatious the court or judge may 
												order the action to be slaked or 
												dismissed or judgment to be 
												entered accordingly as may be 
												just&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The surprise springs from the 
												fact that although plainly there 
												are (1) disputed facts and (2) 
												substantial and or obscure 
												questions of law fit to be tried 
												have been raised on either side 
												of the divide, the defendants 
												applied under the rules, 2,3 and 
												4 to have the plaintiff action 
												dismissed in its entirety. All 
												the authorities, both binding 
												and highly persuasive, local and 
												English, are agreed that firstly 
												applications brought under rules 
												2 and 3 that is with respect 
												points of law raised on the 
												pleadings, ought not to be 
												entertained where there are 
												disputed facts.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Secondly in applications brought 
												under either rules 2, 3, and 4 
												and as regards rule 4 on the 
												ground that the pleadings do not 
												disclose a reasonable cause of 
												action no affidavit evidence may 
												be admitted and examined.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On these two important 
												statements of the law I would 
												refer to the Annual Practice 
												1966 Edition.&nbsp; In examining the 
												scope of the rule that is order 
												25 r 3, the learned author 
												states under the heading.&nbsp; 
												&quot;Dismissal of action. Scope of 
												rules Objection in point of law 
												(O 25 r 3) subheaded.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Application for Hearing before 
												trial&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The master as a rule will only 
												make the order when he sees that 
												the Objection raises a serious 
												question of law, which if 
												decided in favour of the party 
												objecting, would dispose with 
												any further trial, or at any 
												rate with the trial of some 
												substantial issue in the action. 
												The order should not be made in 
												respect of matters which by 
												reason of the obscurity either 
												of the facts or the law ought to 
												be decided at the trial, only in 
												respect of matters on which no 
												further light would be thrown at 
												the trial (per Roche J Isaacs 
												and Son, Ltd. vs. Cook 1925 2 KB 
												P 40) applied in Tarvena vs. 
												Glamergan County Council 1941 57 
												TLR 243.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The order for argument before 
												trial should not be made where 
												there are facts in dispute and 
												if made may be set aside at the 
												hearing (Western SS Co vs. 
												Amoral Sutherland and Co. 1914 
												3KB 55 Part vs. London Assurance 
												Co. S.T.LR, 88, SCOH vs. 
												Mercantile Accident Co Ibid 
												431).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Again, as already stated, the 
												authorities are clear that in 
												applications brought under 
												rules, 2, 3, and 4 (were based 
												on the ground that it discloses 
												no reasonable cause of action), 
												no evidence and consequently no 
												affidavit whatsoever is 
												admissible in proof or disproof 
												of either the legal objection, 
												point of law so raised or the 
												allegation that the pleading 
												discloses no reasonable cause of 
												action or answer.&nbsp; With respect 
												to the latter in particular, 
												that is application brought 
												under rule 4 on the ground of 
												want of reasonable cause of 
												action, the following are the 
												binding local authorities on the 
												point:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												1.&nbsp; Ghana Muslims Representative 
												Council vs. Salifu 1975 2 GLR CA 
												at 261 per Azu Crabbe at 261.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2. Tackie vs. Baroudi 1977 1 GLR 
												36 at p. 43 </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Harlley vs. Ejura Farms 
												Ltd. 1977 2 GLR 1 79 at page 194 
												CA full Bench.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It thus follows that a court 
												ought not to entertain an 
												objection in point of law under 
												order 25 rules 2, 3 and 4 (based 
												on ground that no reasonable 
												cause of action is disclosed), 
												where there are disputed facts. 
												Usually, an application to set 
												down points of law raised on the 
												pleadings is made at summons for 
												directions.&nbsp; And even so, where 
												an order has previously been 
												made to hear and dispose of any 
												such legal point, at the 
												hearing, the court has power to 
												set the said order aside 
												particularly when it becomes 
												plainly obvious that there are 
												disputed facts and further more 
												importantly, where that the 
												legal point cannot be disposed 
												of without first settling these 
												factual issues in dispute. I 
												think that under such 
												circumstances the court ought to 
												relieve itself of the impossible 
												burden of determining or 
												disposing of a case on a point 
												of law under rules 2 and 3 and 
												so set the order aside.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is to the learned trial 
												judge&#8217;s credit that he rightly 
												identified the matters in 
												contention between the parties, 
												both legal and factual, that 
												ought to be tried under the 
												application brought under the 
												rules 2, 3 and 4 as well as the 
												inherent jurisdiction of the 
												court. The unfortunate thing 
												however is that, he plainly went 
												against the rules by:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												1.&nbsp;&nbsp; not only determining 
												disputed questions of fact but</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2. using extrinsic evidence that 
												is affidavit evidence and 
												annexures to determine those 
												facts.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Thus for example, on the 
												question of statute bar the 
												entire decision rested on the 
												question of the applicable Texan 
												laws, which is foreign law. The 
												well-settled rule of law is that 
												foreign law must be proved as a 
												fact that by way of evidence 
												adduced at a trial and not 
												certainly by the means of 
												affidavit (s).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Again, we take the fundamental 
												issue of whether or not there 
												existed a contractual 
												relationship between the 
												parties. The court unfortunately 
												fell into error by using 
												inadmissible evidence to resolve 
												this substantial question of 
												mixed law and fact.&nbsp; As regard 
												the resolution of the latter, 
												the court repeatedly referred to 
												the affidavits and annexures of 
												De Lange dated 27th January 1994 
												and one H.N. Kuofie filed on 
												26th October, 1993 and made very 
												serious and damaging findings of 
												fact thereon. I think I should 
												reproduce the pertinent portions 
												of the ruling. The judge 
												stated:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The defendants have contended 
												that the contract was between 
												the plaintiffs and the 
												charterer.&nbsp; For their 
												contention, they rely on exhibit 
												B which is attached to the 
												affidavit of H.N. Kuofie filed 
												on 26th October 1993.&nbsp; On the 
												exhibit there is a stamp 
												inscription and the word 
												charterer account at the column 
												for the signature of the 
												recipient of fuel supply. It is 
												obvious from the defendants and 
												the plaintiffs did not have a 
												hand in the stamp on the 
												document since they could not 
												have had possession of the stamp 
												charterer account and M/V Vinta 
												came from the defendants and the 
												plaintiffs did not a had in the 
												stamp o the document since they 
												could not have had possession of 
												the stamp.&nbsp; In the instant case 
												the defendants have not 
												demonstrated to the court that 
												the presumption that arose when 
												the plaintiffs supplied fuel to 
												the vessel M/V Vinta has been 
												successfully rebutted for the 
												simple reason that the 
												defendants have not been able to 
												establish to the satisfaction of 
												the court that the plaintiffs 
												looked solely to the personal 
												credit of the charterer.&nbsp; It 
												means therefore that the 
												plaintiffs in the circumstances 
												have done nothing to waive the 
												maritime lien that arose as a 
												matter of statutory law upon the 
												furnishing of banker fuel to the 
												vessel in the United States.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												How can a party be condemned for 
												having failed to rebut a 
												presumption of the kind 
												described by the learned trial 
												judge, without the party being 
												allowed to lead evidence on the 
												substantial question of what he 
												looked for in the charterers?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Similarly, on the equally 
												important question of whether or 
												not the plaintiffs have the 
												capacity to institute the 
												present proceedings, the court 
												relied on the affidavit or 
												Attuglingi in proof of Texan 
												law.&nbsp; And when in the course of 
												answering this large question of 
												capacity, the learned trial 
												judge found it necessary to 
												determine the related issue of 
												whether or not failure:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;To notify the debtor of an 
												assignment rendered the 
												assignment ineffective&#8221;,&nbsp; he 
												turned to affidavits to resolve 
												the issue. So he stated,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The last submission of learned 
												counsel for the defendants 
												application is that failure to 
												notify the debtor of the 
												assignment rendered the 
												assignment ineffective.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
												answer to the position taken by 
												the defendant counsel, the 
												plaintiff filed an affidavit in 
												opposition on 25th January, 1994 
												which has attached to it an 
												affidavit of Hollis (so we have 
												an affidavit within an 
												affidavit) which explains the 
												legal position in the state of 
												Texas as follows&quot;. &nbsp;&nbsp;However in 
												the affidavit of De Lange 
												attached to the defendants 
												supplement affidavit filed on 
												27th January, 1994, he draws a 
												distinction between transfer of 
												ownership of debt and assignment 
												of maritime lien and assents 
												that under maritime law in order 
												to assent, not merely debt, but 
												a maritime lien, one must notify 
												the vessel of the assignment.&nbsp; 
												Thus in the affidavit De Lange 
												separates the right due to the 
												assignee of a debt for which he 
												would be entitled to maritime 
												lien from the maritime lien 
												itself.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is plain that the procedure 
												adopted by learned trial judge 
												was not permitted under the 
												rules.&nbsp; Under the circumstances 
												in which he found himself, 
												caught in a web, where at the 
												hearing he had to determine an 
												issue of fact, of what he ought 
												to have done was to relieve 
												himself of the intolerable 
												burden of determining these 
												issues since no evidence had 
												been led on them. It is in my 
												view a grievous error on his 
												part to have allowed himself to 
												have been trapped into relying 
												on affidavits filed by both 
												sides to resolve these intricate 
												questions of fact.&nbsp; I would at 
												the risk of sounding repetitive 
												say that even though he had 
												already made the order to have 
												the case disposed of by legal 
												argument he ought not to have 
												proceeded a step further when he 
												found himself in this quandary 
												for the court has power to 
												vacate the order erroneously 
												made.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												But perhaps, there were more 
												disturbing aspect of the 
												decision complained of in the 
												fact that the trial court went 
												beyond the prayer of the 
												applicant and gave judgment 
												summarily for the plaintiff. 
												What I mean is this.&nbsp; The 
												Defendant went to the court with 
												a simple request, for an order 
												dismissing plaintiff&#8217;s claim on 
												the grounds I have already 
												stated.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												True in the motion, as is 
												usually the case in all motions, 
												he prayed for further or other 
												orders, as the court may deem 
												fit.&nbsp; In my view, this prayer 
												properly understood should be 
												limited to such orders as are 
												ancillary to or flows from the 
												principal order sought.&nbsp; So that 
												in the case that learned trial 
												judge was met with, if he did 
												not think the contract was 
												statute barred, or that there 
												existed a contract between the 
												parties or that the plaintiff 
												does have capacity, all he was 
												under the circumstances of the 
												case empowered to do was to 
												decline the prayer and direct 
												the case to proceed in the 
												normal way.&nbsp; This means the 
												plaintiff was thereafter free to 
												lead evidence in proof of all 
												disputed facts.&nbsp; Unfortunately, 
												the trial judge proceeded to 
												make not only definitive 
												findings on matters in 
												contention but went ahead to 
												give judgment in full together 
												with interest at the rate and 
												for the periods claimed, matters 
												which have been denied 
												categorically by the defence.&nbsp; I 
												do not think the plaintiff at 
												this rehearing can defend this 
												position taken by the learned 
												justice. It cannot be defended 
												on the grounds the parties 
												agreed that the order be made. 
												Indeed where a party or parties 
												pray for any order or orders, 
												relief or reliefs not warranted 
												by any of rule of law or 
												procedure a courts plain duty is 
												to refuse it or them.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There is also one other good 
												reason why apart from the fact 
												that extrinsic evidence was 
												inadmissible, the application 
												under order 25 rule 4 ought not 
												to have been entertained. But I 
												propose to deal with it when 
												considering the application 
												under the inherent jurisdiction 
												or the court. Therefore while I 
												agree that the judge was right 
												in dismissing the application as 
												brought under orders 2, 3, and 4 
												think he erred in entering 
												judgment for the plaintiffs.&nbsp; 
												Certainly the judgement which 
												was based solely on the wrong 
												findings and which findings were 
												deduced from plainly 
												inadmissible evidence ought not 
												to stand.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Admittedly the application to 
												dismiss the claim was also 
												brought under the inherent 
												jurisdiction of the court. While 
												it is true that in applications 
												brought under this, the court is 
												entitled to have resort to 
												extrinsic evidence, not merely 
												the pleadings and so affidavit 
												evidence is clearly admissible; 
												the question is whether the 
												applicant would have succeeded. 
												It naturally calls for a 
												determination of the 
												circumstances under which the 
												rule would apply.&nbsp; Again, the 
												celebrated case of the Ghana 
												Muslim Representative Council 
												vs. Salifu (supra) provides a 
												ready answer.&nbsp; I would quote His 
												Lordship, the Mr. Justice Azu 
												Crabbe CJ&#8217;s thinking on the 
												matter, when faced with a 
												similar issue. The learned Chief 
												Justice said &quot;Although Mr. 
												Reindorfs did not indicate in 
												his argument the rule under 
												which he was inviting the court 
												to uphold the dismissal of the 
												plaintiffs claim; there are two 
												methods by which the court can 
												deal with Mr. Reindorfs second 
												submission, first under the 
												inherent jurisdiction of the 
												court, and secondly under order 
												25 rule 4 of the High Court 
												Civil Procedure Rule, 1954. The 
												practice in each case is well 
												settled.&nbsp; The practice matter 
												the first is clearly expressed 
												by Lord Herschell in Lawrence 
												vs. Lord Norreys 1890 15 App. 
												Cases 210 at page 219 its as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; It cannot be doubted that the 
												court has an inherent 
												jurisdiction to dismiss an 
												action which is an abuse of the 
												process of the court. It is a 
												jurisdiction, which ought to be 
												very sparingly exercised and 
												only in very exceptional cases.&nbsp; 
												I do not think its exercise 
												would be justified merely 
												because the story told in the 
												pleadings was highly improbable 
												and one which it was difficult 
												to believe court be prayed.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In my opinion, I do think that 
												having regard to the substantial 
												matters of fact and law raised 
												in the application itself, that 
												this was a case in which the 
												learned trial justice exercised 
												his discretion properly by 
												refusing the application to 
												dismiss the plaintiffs action 
												and the finding ought not to be 
												disturbed.&nbsp; My only worry is 
												that he failed thereupon to 
												direct the matter to proceed to 
												trial.&nbsp; In other words I am not 
												happy that he proceeded to give 
												judgment in favour of the 
												plaintiff.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Similarly, I do think he was 
												right in refusing the 
												application to dismiss the 
												action under order 25 rule 4. 
												The power under order 25 rule 4 
												is exercisable only where the 
												case is beyond doubt.&nbsp;&nbsp; But 
												again the clear position of the 
												law is that the pleading may be 
												struck out only in a plain and 
												obvious case where it is 
												apparent (on the face of the 
												pleadings) that even if the 
												facts were proved, the plaintiff 
												is not entitled to the relief he 
												seeks: Hubbuch and Sons Ltd. vs. 
												Wilkinson, Heywood and Clauk 
												Ltd. 1899 1QB 86 at p. 91 CA. 
												Barton, Thompson Co. Ltd. vs. 
												Stappling Machines Co. 1966 1ch 
												499. The jurisdiction conferred 
												by this rule it has been said is 
												one to be exercised with extreme 
												caution, Moore vs. Lawson 1915 
												31 TLR 418 at 419 per Azu Crabbe 
												in the Ghana Muslim 
												Representative Case (Supra).&nbsp; 
												How then can it seriously be 
												said that the plaintiffs 
												pleadings (only pleadings not 
												affidavits) disclose reasonable 
												cause of action?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Clearly, the application under 
												order 25 rule 4 is misconceived. 
												Again, the object of the rule is 
												to weed out frivolous or 
												vexatious action.&nbsp; But then, the 
												frivolity or vexatiousnes must 
												be plainly apparent on the face 
												of the pleadings.&nbsp; Speaking for 
												myself, I do not think the 
												plaintiff&#8217;s pleadings can be 
												classified as such.&nbsp; I would 
												also not say they are an abuse 
												of the process either.&nbsp; The 
												question of whether they would 
												succeed is an entirely different 
												matter and is of no 
												consideration in applications of 
												this nature.&nbsp; I would end by 
												making this observation.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am 
												amazed at the &quot;ingenuity&quot; by 
												which with the exception of rule 
												5, applicant counsel combined 
												all the rules under order 25 and 
												succeeded also in tagging on the 
												inherent jurisdiction of the 
												court. In this case, I am 
												tempted to think that the 
												inherent jurisdiction was added 
												not out of abundance of caution, 
												or ignorance but plainly on 
												purpose.&nbsp; I believe it was 
												calculated to allow through the 
												back door, extrinsic, that is 
												affidavit evidence and so avoid 
												the bother and possibly expense 
												of a trial.&nbsp; So for example, if 
												he has to prove foreign law, the 
												expert witness must, unavoidably 
												come from Texas, for it is only 
												under inherent jurisdiction that 
												affidavit evidence may be 
												resorted to.&nbsp; If this were not 
												counsels motive, when the rules 
												of court, in express and 
												unambiguous terms has given 
												power to the court to strike out 
												pleadings and dismiss a case 
												where it discloses no reasonable 
												cause of action, or is clearly 
												frivolous or vexations, why 
												resort additionally to the 
												inherent jurisdiction rule to 
												have a case dismissed on the 
												grounds of abuse of process.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Certainly, where the pleadings 
												disclose no reasonable cause of 
												action, or where the pleading 
												are frivolous or vexations they 
												may also possibly and properly 
												be described as being abusive of 
												the process. But the point I 
												wish to emphasise is this: where 
												the pleadings disclose no 
												reasonable cause of action etc., 
												one does not need the help of 
												the inherent jurisdiction to 
												bolster up one's cause, unless 
												as I have already intimated, the 
												real intention is to &quot;smuggle&quot; 
												in matters which ought properly 
												to have been introduced by way 
												of viva voce evidence.&nbsp; I do not 
												think the rules of court are 
												intended to be employed for such 
												purposes and so short circuit 
												trials. When so utilized to 
												obtain undeserving &quot;summary&quot; 
												decisions they do nobody any 
												good and rather prolong the 
												trials.&nbsp; I think our courts need 
												to be very vigilant, and quick 
												to resist such moves.</span></p>

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is an appeal from the 
												decision of Accra High Court.&nbsp; 
												The decision itself was given 
												over a dispute on a payment of 
												US $70,543.82 being the cost of 
												oil supplied to a vessel 
												described as &#8220;M/V Vinta&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The oil was supplied in 1989 in 
												the State of Texas.&nbsp; Claiming 
												that the indebtedness had been 
												assigned to it, the plaintiff 
												sued on 16th August 1993 in 
												Ghana when the vessel docked at 
												the Tema Harbour.&nbsp; The 
												defendants are the owners of the 
												vessel.&nbsp; They resisted the claim 
												on three main grounds, namely, 
												that </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												1. The plaintiff lacked capacity 
												to sue because Best Oil Company, 
												which supplied the oil, had its 
												certificate to operate withdrawn 
												in its home State of Texas.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2. The action was statute barred 
												because the Law of Texas should 
												have instituted it within three 
												years but it was brought after 
												that period.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3. The defendant had not entered 
												into a contract with the 
												Plaintiff Company.&nbsp; It rather 
												had a charter contract with 
												another company, which in turn 
												had bunkered the ship and was 
												liable to Best Oil Service for 
												the oil supplied.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Before the filing of summons for 
												directions, the defendants filed 
												a motion on notice under L.N. 
												140 A, Order 25, rr 2, 3, and 4 
												and under the inherent 
												jurisdiction of the Court.&nbsp; The 
												essence of the motion was that 
												the suit should be dismissed on 
												arguments based on the three 
												defences summarized above.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The affidavits and exhibits 
												supported the motion. The 
												plaintiff opposed it and also 
												filed affidavit in opposition 
												backed by exhibits.&nbsp; In the 
												opposing affidavit, the 
												plaintiff contended that the 
												claim was not statute barred and 
												further that since the debt had 
												been assigned to it, it had 
												capacity to institute the 
												action.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												After the motion had been 
												argued, it was dismissed by the 
												trial High Court which proceeded 
												to enter judgment for the 
												plaintiff.&nbsp; Against the 
												judgement, the defendants, 
												hereafter referred to as the 
												appellants, have appealed to the 
												Court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The notice of appeal state the 
												grounds of appeal as follows.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) The learned judge erred in 
												holding that the plaintiff&#8217;s 
												claim is not statute-barred.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) The learned judge erred in 
												holding that the defendants are 
												liable for maritime lien 
												resulting from transaction 
												between the chartered and the 
												plaintiff. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(c) The learned trial judge 
												erred in holding that the 
												assignment of debt to the 
												plaintiff by Best Oil Service 
												Inc.&nbsp; was effective in spite of 
												the absence of any notice of the 
												assignment to the defendants 
												prior to the commencement of 
												this suit.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(d) Further grounds may be filed 
												upon receipt of the honourable 
												court&#8217;s ruling&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In spite of the last point in 
												the notice of appeal, no 
												additional ground was filed. In 
												the appellant&#8217;s statement of 
												case, however, they argued a 
												fourth ground to the effect 
												that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The learned trial judge erred 
												in failing to consider and to 
												apply the equitable doctrine of 
												laches to the issue of whether 
												or not the suit to arrest the 
												vessel M/V Vinta in Ghana should 
												be barred for unreasonable delay 
												and prejuice.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This fourth ground should be 
												summarily dismissed for the 
												simple reason that since it 
												raises issue of estoppel, it 
												should have been pleaded in the 
												trial court.&nbsp; It was not 
												pleaded. As counsel for the 
												plaintiff, to be hereafter 
												called the respondent, rightly 
												pointed out, that ground is 
												based on fresh evidence where no 
												application had been filed to 
												adduce fresh evidence and none 
												had been granted.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ground 
												was contrary to Rule 26 of CI. 
												19 of&nbsp; 1997 and failed 
												accordingly.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellant&#8217;s motion was 
												headed as follows:</span></p>

												and the inherent jurisdiction of

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Order 25 reads as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Any party shall be entitled to 
												raise by his pleadings any point

												after the trial, provided that 
												by consent of the parties or by 
												order of the Court or a judge on 
												the application of either party, 
												the same may set down for 
												hearing and disposed of at any 
												time before the trial.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This rule is often read with 
												rule 3, which is as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;If, in the opinion of the Court 
												or Judge, the decision of such

												action.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												For the purpose of such 
												arguments, the defendant 
												objecting is taken to admit all 
												the facts alleged in the 
												plaintiff&#8217;s pleadings: See 
												BURROWS V. PHODES (1899), QB. 
												821 and ANDERSON V. MIDLAND RLY 
												[1920] 1 Ch. 374.&nbsp; That was the

												raised under Order 25, r. 2 and

												A, the party objecting was to be 
												taken to have admitted all the

												raise the legal inference or

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A third principle considered in 
												applying rule 2 which is quite 
												similar to the last prerequisite 
												is that the order is made only:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;In respect of matters on which 
												no further light could be thrown 
												at the trial.&nbsp; As it was held in 
												ISAACS AND SONS LTD. V. COOK 
												[1925] 2 K. B. 401 at page 404 
												such an order &#8220;should not be 
												made in respect of matters which 
												by reason of the obscurity 
												either of the facts or the law 
												ought to be decided at the 
												trial.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What are the facts in the 
												instant motion to which these 
												three principles can apply? They 
												are these:&nbsp; By the time the 
												motion was filed in the trial 
												court, the pleadings and the 
												affidavits had stated the 
												respective positions of the 
												parties as follows:&nbsp; The 
												respondent sued in their 
												capacity as assignees of debts.&nbsp; 
												The appellants did not admit 
												that.&nbsp; They rather contended 
												that the respondent lacked 
												capacity to sue.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to 
												the appellants, the reason for 
												the respondent&#8217;s lack of 
												capacity to sue was that its 
												license to operate had been 
												withdrawn in its parent country 
												of the State of Texas.&nbsp; The 
												appellant took the issue further 
												by arguing that in any case it 
												had no contract with the 
												respondent in respect of the 
												supply of oil to the ship.&nbsp; The 
												respondent&#8217;s reply was that the 
												assignment gave them the right 
												to sue in place of the original 
												supplier of the oil.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right 
												from the beginning of the suit, 
												therefore, the defendant did not 
												admit the basic position of the 
												plaintiff.&nbsp; That the facts were 
												in dispute could further be 
												noticed from the appellant&#8217;s 
												contention that according to 
												Texas law, the action was 
												statute barred while the 
												respondents relied on an 
												exception to that law to 
												maintain the position that the 
												parties had been outside the 
												State of Texas and therefore 
												were not effected by the law of 
												Texas on limitation of actions.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												From the foregoing, it is 
												apparent that </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(i) The appellant did not admit 
												the facts alleged by the 
												respondent in its pleadings.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(ii) The facts of the case as 
												relied upon by the respondent 
												and appellant were in dispute.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(iii) The respective positions 
												are likely to be changed if 
												evidence were led on the present 
												date of the assignment because 
												if the assignment pre-dated the 
												withdrawal of the license, it 
												would not have affected the 
												capacity of the respondent to 
												sue as assignees.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												If the assignment post-dated the 
												withdrawal of the license the 
												capacity of the respondent would 
												be affected.&nbsp;&nbsp; The positions of 
												the parties will also be changed 
												if evidence to be led affected 
												the issue of limitation, which 
												was a serious bone of contention 
												between them. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The facts not admitted by the 
												defendants or the disputed facts 
												will only be resolved by 
												adduction of evidence.&nbsp; In about 
												the only two cases (albeit High 
												Court Cases) in which the issues 
												have been directly delt with, it 
												was held that Order 25, r. 2 
												should not be applied when the 
												objection rests on evidence or 
												disputed facts or where evidence 
												will be required to resolve 
												issue appearing in the 
												pleadings.&nbsp; These were OSEI V. 
												DONKOR [1972] 2 GLR 45 and BEKOE 
												V. SOREBOUR [1977] 1 GLR 118.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It follows from the foregoing 
												that Order 25, r.2 was not 
												applicable to the motion filed 
												by the appellant notwithstanding 
												the fact that it stated on the 
												face of the motion in its 
												heading that it was brought 
												under Order 25, rr.2 and 3.&nbsp; The 
												trial judge therefore erred in 
												considering the objection on the 
												basis of the provisions in rule 
												2 and 3 of Order 25.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												But that did end matters there.&nbsp; 
												The application was also brought 
												under Order 25, rule 4 and under 
												the inherent jurisdiction of the 
												Court.&nbsp; Rule 4 reads as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The court or a judge may order 
												any pleading to be struck out, 
												on the ground that it discloses 
												no reasonable cause of action or 
												answer, and in any such cases or 
												in case of the action or defence 
												being shown by the pleadings to 
												be frivolous and vexatious, the 
												Court or a judge may order the 
												action to be stayed or 
												dismissed, or judgment to be 
												entered accordingly, as may be 
												just.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Motions under this rule are 
												considered under two distinct 
												heads: The first is the motion 
												to strike out pleadings on the 
												ground that they disclose no 
												reasonable cause of action.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The second is to invoke the 
												inherent jurisdiction of the 
												Court to strike out the action 
												or defence on the ground that it 
												is frivolous and vexatious.&nbsp; The 
												authorities and decided case 
												over the years have clearly 
												delineated the distinction 
												between the two and the 
												conditions under which each may 
												be applied. In the count book it 
												is stated at p. 448 that</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The principal distinction 
												between the inherent 
												jurisdiction and that under the 
												rule seems to be that when the 
												Court is acting under its 
												inherent jurisdiction evidence 
												by affidavit may be received to 
												show that a pleading is an abuse 
												of the process of the Court; 
												whereas under this rule the 
												nature of the action or defence 
												or defect in the pleadings must 
												appear by the pleadings or 
												particulars and no affidavit is 
												admissible&#8221; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Two English cases, which have 
												explained the difference, will 
												be considered: The explanation 
												from Danckwerts LJ. In WENCDIK 
												V. MOLONEY [1965] 2 ALL ER. 871, 
												CA. was this:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The practice under the former 
												R. S. C. Ord. 25, r4 and under 
												the inherent jurisdiction of the 
												Court was well settled.&nbsp; Under 
												the rule, it had to appear on 
												the face of the plaintiff's 
												pleadings that the action could 
												not succeed or was objectionable 
												for some other reason. No 
												evidence could be filed. In the 
												case of the inherent power of 
												the Court to prevent abuse of 
												its procedure by frivolous or 
												vexatious proceedings or 
												proceedings which were shown to 
												be an abuse of the procedure of 
												the court, affidavits could be 
												filed to show why the action was 
												objectionable. The commonest 
												case was where a plaintiff was 
												seeking to bring action on a 
												ground which had already been 
												decided or was obviously wholly 
												imaginary&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In REPUBLIC OF PERU V. PERUVIAN 
												GUNNED CO. (1887) 36 Ch. D. 489, 
												Chitty J stated the distinction 
												thus:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Under rule 4 no affidavit is 
												admissible. That is plain from 
												the terms of the rule itself. In 
												regard to the second branch of 
												the rule relating to the stay of 
												frivolous and vexatious action . 
												. . affidavits are admissible, 
												not by virtue of the rule, but 
												of the general jurisdiction of 
												the Court.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The local cases that one may 
												found in our law reports are 
												more or less based on the above 
												authorities and they make the 
												distinction explicit.&nbsp; Two High 
												Court cases where the 
												distinctions were made are 
												Amissah-Abadoo v. Abadoo [1973] 
												1 GLR 40-1.&nbsp; In GHANA MUSLIM 
												REPRESENTATIVE COUNCIL V. SALIFU 
												[1975] 2 GLR 246, the then Court 
												of Appeal held that since 
												evidence had to be led before 
												issues arising in the case could 
												be resolved, Order 25, r4 was 
												inapplicable.&nbsp; On another 
												occasion, that Court in TACKIE 
												V. BAROUDI [1977]1 GLR 26 at p. 
												43 held per Azu Crabbe CJ. that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Apart from interpretation am 
												satisfied that affidavit 
												evidence is inadmissible on an 
												application under Order 25, r4 
												to strike out a statement of 
												claim on the ground that it 
												discloses no reasonable cause of 
												action&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												From all the foregoing, the 
												exact position under Order 25, 
												r4 may in summed up as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Order 25, r4 connotes two 
												methods of objecting to 
												pleadings or actions:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												a. The first is objection based 
												on the fact that the plaintiff&#8217;s 
												claim discloses no reasonable 
												cause of section.&nbsp; There are 
												four will settled limitations 
												which regulate this kind of 
												objection: These are</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												1. That objection is raised on 
												rule 4 itself, and nothing else.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2.&nbsp; That objection should be 
												determined excessively on the 
												pleadings and affidavit, which 
												should ex facie disclose that 
												the plaintiff&#8217;s claim discloses 
												no cause of action and so should 
												be dismissed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3.&nbsp; No affidavit, exhibit or 
												extrinsic evidence is admissible 
												when objection is raised on this 
												ground. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												4. If affidavit or extrinsic 
												evidence have to be relied upon 
												in order to sustain an objection 
												under this rule, then the rule 
												is simply inapplicable.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												b. The second method under rule 
												4 invokes the inherent 
												jurisdiction of the Court to 
												protect itself against abuse of 
												its process and procedure.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The limitations on the 
												application of these methods are 
												as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(i) Under the inherent 
												jurisdiction, objection may be 
												raised for pleadings to be 
												struck out or action dismissed 
												on the grounds that it is 
												frivolous, vexatious or abuse of 
												Court process.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(ii) Affidavits, exhibits and 
												extrinsic evidence are 
												admissible to show the claims or 
												pleadings are frivolous and 
												vexatious and therefore amount 
												to abuse of court process.&nbsp; 
												Typical grounds for such 
												application will, inter alia, be 
												when the defendant contends that 
												the issue in the action has been 
												tried already or where the 
												pleadings are grossly scandalous 
												or when the defence discloses no 
												valid answer to the claims.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The exact position in the 
												instant case are as follows: The 
												appellant and the respondent 
												have had to file and rely 
												heavily on affidavits and 
												extrinsic evidence in the form 
												of exhibits or opinions of legal 
												experts in order to substantiate 
												and oppose the motion.&nbsp; That 
												alone takes the motion out of 
												the ambit of rule 4 of Order 25 
												itself.&nbsp; This was the view taken 
												by Lord Justice A. L. Smith in 
												Attorney-General of the Duchy of 
												Lancaster v. London and North 
												Western Railway (1892) 3 Ch. 274 
												where he stated at p. 278:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;I only want to make one remark 
												about XXV, r4.&nbsp; It seems to me 
												that when there is an 
												application made to strike out a 
												pleading and you have to go to 
												extrinsic evidence to show that 
												the pleading is bad, that rule 
												does not apply.&nbsp; It is only when 
												upon the fact of it, it is shown 
												that the pleading discloses no 
												cause of action or defence or 
												that it is frivolous and 
												vexatious, that the rule 
												applies. In this case it is 
												manifest that you must go to 
												extrinsic evidence to show that 
												the pleading is bad, and 
												directly it comes to that, the 
												rule does not apply&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In OKOFOH ESTATES LTD V. MODERN 
												SIGNS LTD. [1996&#8211;97] S GLR 224 
												the defendant filed a motion on 
												notice &quot;to dismiss the suit for 
												non-disclosure of cause of 
												action&#8221;.&nbsp; The Supreme Court took 
												the view that that ground 
												brought the application under 
												Order 25, r4 citing ATTORNEY 
												GENERAL OF DUCHY OF LANCASTER V. 
												LONDON AND NORTH WESTERN RLY 
												(supra).&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the trial 
												judge took into account 
												extrinsic evidence in hearing 
												the application and for that 
												reason it was held that &quot;he fell 
												beyond the bounds of his 
												jurisdiction and his ruling 
												would therefore be set aside&quot; as 
												per the headnote at p. 226.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In conclusion, since the trial 
												judge had to rely on an exhibit 
												and extrinsic evidence of the 
												legal experts order 25, r4 did 
												not apply to the instant 
												motion.&nbsp; The trial judge was 
												therefore right when he 
												dismissed the objection, 
												although not on the bases of the 
												inapplicability of Order 25.&nbsp; He 
												rather exercised his discretion 
												wrongly when dismissed the 
												objection and entered judgment 
												on basis of fact and evidence 
												which were seriously contested 
												by both parties.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												If Order 25, rule 4 itself did 
												not apply, the invocation of the 
												inherent jurisdiction of the 
												Court in the instant case did 
												not help the appellants either.&nbsp; 
												This is because in spite of the 
												fact that inherent jurisdiction 
												was referred to in the heading 
												of the motion and further that 
												affidavits and exhibits or 
												extrinsic evidence were relied 
												upon, the appellant canvassed no 
												argument to show that the action 
												was frivolous or vexatious or 
												amounted to abuse of process or 
												court procedure to warrant the 
												invocation of the inherent 
												jurisdiction of the Court to 
												dismiss the respondent's action.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There is yet another reason why 
												the instant case should not have 
												been considered under Order 25, 
												r4.&nbsp; It was that the case itself 
												raised quite serious questions 
												of law&#8212;so serious that both 
												sides had to rely on opinions 
												expressed by legal experts from 
												the United States.&nbsp; The 
												well-established rule is that 
												Order 25, r4 cannot be applied 
												when the objection raised 
												serious questions of law.&nbsp; This 
												was the view taken by the Full 
												Bench of the then Court of 
												Appeal in HARLLEY V. EJURA FARMS 
												(GHANA) LTD. [1977] 2 GLR 179 
												where it was held in the 
												headnote that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;That application to strike out 
												the plaintiff's pleading should 
												not have been entertained and 
												recourse to order 25, r4 ought 
												not to be made in the case 
												involving serious and intricate 
												questions of law DYSON V. 
												ATTORNEY GENERAL itself 
												concerned the application or 
												Order 25, r4 to serious 
												investigation of ancient law and 
												questions of general 
												importance.&nbsp; It was held that 
												Order 25, r4 ought not to apply 
												to that type of cases&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Applying the foregoing to the 
												instant case, the objection in 
												the motion on notice should have 
												been overruled and the case 
												proceeded to trial, more 
												particularly where the 
												appellants did not admit the 
												basic position of the 
												respondents, the facts were 
												hotly disputed, serious 
												questions of the law of Texas 
												needed to be investigated and 
												the motion could not be disposed 
												of without recourse to evidence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												One last point apparent on the 
												face of the record was the fact 
												that the trial judge proceeded 
												to enter judgment for the 
												plaintiff.&nbsp; Order 25, rule 4 
												stipulates towards the end that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												'The judge may order the action 
												to be stayed or dismissed, or 
												judgment to be entered 
												accordingly as may be just&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The rule clearly allows judgment 
												to be entered &quot;as may be just&quot;.&nbsp; 
												The pitfall, which should be 
												consciously avoided by trial 
												judges, is to proceed to enter 
												judgment merely because the 
												objection has failed.&nbsp; Entry of 
												judgment under this rule should 
												not automatically follow the 
												failure of such objection and 
												this should be so even where the 
												party objecting intimates to the 
												court that judgment may be 
												entered on the failure of his 
												objection.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												When judgment has to be entered 
												for the plaintiff on the failure 
												of the objection the court is 
												duty bound from the wording of 
												rule 4 just quoted to examine 
												the merits of the plaintiff&#8217;s 
												claim before the judgment may be 
												entered.&nbsp; It has to be pointed 
												out that if the plaintiff&#8217;s 
												desires summary judgment to be 
												entered on his writ, the motion 
												should properly be brought under 
												Order 14.&nbsp; It will be wrong to 
												use the failure of the objection 
												as ground or for making the 
												plaintiff&#8217;s opposition as being 
												equivalent to an application 
												under Order 14.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Entry of judgment for the 
												plaintiff is quite rare and not 
												many of such cases will be found 
												even in the law reports.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In SALMON V. KNIGHT 8 TLR 472 
												the court not only struck out 
												the defence but also granted the 
												plaintiff an injunction. In 
												REPUBLIC OF PERU V. PERUNIAN 
												GUAMO CO. (supra) the defendant 
												was awarded costs after the 
												action had been dismissed, even 
												though the defendant did not in 
												his motion apply for costs.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 
												ALFA ENT. LYN V. PAN AMERICAN 
												TR. CO [1979] GLR s71. CA. 
												Summary judgment was given for 
												the plaintiff under Order 25, r2 
												but that case was based on 
												admission in the pleadings and 
												was therefore quite different 
												from the instant case where the 
												facts are disputed and issues 
												contested.&nbsp; Even if counsel for 
												the appellant in his submissions 
												before the trial court stated 
												that judgment could be entered 
												against him if his objection 
												failed, that statement could 
												easily be impugned as being 
												contrary to the provision of 
												Order 25, r4 and Order 14 and on 
												the authority of RAMIA V. FOOD 
												SPECIALITIES (GH) LTD. 1987&#8212;88 . 
												. . GLR . . .&nbsp; In that case 
												counsel consented that this 
												Court of Appeal could assume 
												jurisdiction over an arbitration 
												case and make certain orders.&nbsp; 
												On the bases of consents by 
												counsel for both sides, Orders 
												were made. Thereafter one of the 
												consenting parties appealed to 
												the Supreme Court on the ground 
												that consent was contrary to the 
												express provision of Arbitration 
												Act 1961 (Act. . .) The appeal 
												was allowed and the order set 
												aside.&nbsp; By the same argument the 
												statement of the appellant's 
												counsel in the instant case 
												could not vest the trial court 
												with jurisdiction to enter 
												judgment under circumstances not 
												sanctioned by the rules in LN 
												140A.&nbsp; The trial judge, with 
												respect, erred by entering 
												judgment for the respondent when 
												the appellant's objection 
												failed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial judge was right in 
												dismissing the objection, 
												although not for the report 
												stated in his judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Appeal 
												against that order will 
												therefore be dismissed. </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I am however of the opinion that

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">

												(e) An order of perpetual 
												injunction restraining the 
												respondent herein from 
												interfering with her enjoyment 
												of the property. Subsequent 
												thereto, the respondent herein 
												filed a reply to the answer of 
												the Appellant herein and invited 
												the trial Court in its inherent 
												jurisdiction to set aside the 
												adoption order in respect of the 
												only child of the marriage 
												namely Samuel Esi Acquah on the 
												grounds of fraud.&nbsp; The appellant 
												herein from the admitted 
												evidence was the natural mother 
												of the adopted child.&nbsp; The 
												action hereinafter proceeded to 
												a full scale trial at the end of 
												which the learned trial judge of 
												the High Court delivered his 
												judgment in favour of the 
												petitioner on all the reliefs 
												claimed and dismissed the 
												cross-petition of the appellant 
												herein. The said delivery of the 
												trial court was made on 10/12/97 
												and on the 15th of December 97, 
												the appellant herein caused an 
												appeal to be lodged against the 
												same on the following grounds:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) That the trial judge erred 
												in lodging that H/No. A.52, 
												Abura Estate was the absolute 
												property of the 
												Petitioner/Respondent.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) That the trial judge erred 
												in failing to hold that H/No. 
												A.52, Abura Estate was purchased 
												by the respondent/appellant from 
												money remitted to her for her 
												maintenance.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3) That the petitioner 
												respondent being a foreign 
												national cannot be entitled to 
												the transfer of the title 
												ordered.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(4) That the judgment is against 
												the weight of the evidence 
												adduced at the trial.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Although by the notice of Appeal 
												filed on 15/12/97, it was 
												indicated that further grounds 
												would be filed, none was filed, 
												the result of which is that the 
												statement filed by learned 
												counsel for the appellant was 
												limited to the said four grounds 
												only.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I have examined the record of 
												proceedings in this matter and 
												had the benefit of the statement 
												filed on behalf of the parties 
												to these proceedings and I am of 
												the view that the point which 
												comes up for determination in 
												his appeal is a short one which 
												turns mainly on the effect of 
												the admitted evidence, the said 
												point being did learned trial 
												judge come to the right 
												conclusion on the facts which 
												unfolded before him? It is 
												settled law that the judgment of 
												a trial court on matters of fact 
												as opposed to those which are 
												legal can only be interfered 
												with when the trial court did 
												not come to the right conclusion 
												on the facts and or come to an 
												unreasonable conclusion on the 
												same: see (1) CUDJOE V. KWATCHEY 
												[1935] 2 WACA 371. (2) NYAME V. 
												TARZAN [1973] 1 GLR 8.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Indeed such is the settle 
												attitude of appellant court that 
												in the case of BASI &amp; ORS. VRS. 
												TABIRI @ ASARE [1987-88] 2 
												DIGEST PARA 36 @ 79 this court 
												observed thus;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;It was never intended that the 
												court of Appeal (or any 
												appellant court for that matter) 
												should move to a new era of 
												regular questioning of decisions 
												of fact as distinct from law 
												which were supportable.&nbsp; 
												Consequently there could be no 
												grounds or cavilling at the 
												trial judge&#8217;s exercise of 
												direction or duty in the 
												selection of witness to believe 
												or in stating his findings of 
												fact.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Speaking for myself, I am of the 
												view after a patient and 
												critical reading of the record 
												of proceedings in this matter 
												that the learned trial judge 
												well and truly evaluated the 
												pieces of admitted evidence and 
												came to the right conclusion on 
												the same. In fact, I venture the 
												say that such was the quality of 
												his evaluation that since I do 
												not disagree with him on the 
												same.&nbsp; I would in my delivery 
												read in extenso a portion of his 
												judgment which by these 
												proceedings it is sought by the 
												appellant to be impeached: At 
												page 140 of the record of appeal 
												wherein he analyses some of the 
												evidence, the learned trial 
												judge says: &#8220;I now come to the 
												question of the house at Cape 
												Coast. There is no dispute that 
												the petitioner provided funds 
												for the acquisition of the 
												house.&nbsp; He provided 22,000.00 US 
												dollars converted into 
												22,000,000.00 cedis, that on the 
												evidence more than covered the 
												purchase price of 
												18,770,000.00.&nbsp; The respondent 
												set out to say that the amount 
												was given to her for the support 
												and the maintenance of herself 
												and her child.&nbsp; I am satisfied 
												that the respondent was evading 
												the truth here.&nbsp; There is 
												overwhelming and uncontroverted 
												evidence that the Petitioner 
												arrive in Ghana on three 
												occasions carrying fat sums of 
												money for the maintenance of the 
												family; he brought 11 million 
												cedis, 9 million cedis, and 5 
												million cedis on the consecutive 
												visits and left 3 million cedis, 
												2 million cedis and 3 million 
												cedis respectively before his 
												outward journeys and these 
												residues were offered for the 
												maintenance of the wife and 
												child.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Besides, the respondent frankly 
												admitted that she received 
												remittance for maintenance from 
												the petitioner whilst he was 
												away, she was not ashamed to 
												declare that the Petitioner took 
												good care of her and the child. 
												Above all, the respondent did 
												extremely affirm in 
												cross-examination that the sum 
												of 22, 000.000.00 cedis given 
												her was meant for the house in 
												question. She also candidly 
												agreed that the Petitioner sent 
												other or further sums of money 
												for certain installations in the 
												house.&nbsp; These sums included an 
												amount of 1,500 US dollar (about 
												1,500,000.00 cedis) which with 
												the active support of Samuel 
												Yirenkyi, she fraudulently made 
												the Petitioner remit her for an 
												alleged outstanding of the 
												purchase price of the house.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is extremely significant to 
												say that the respondent wrote 
												without ceasing to the 
												Petitioner to proclaim the house 
												as his own. (see Exhibit C1 and 
												C4 as well as Exhibit C and C3). 
												In Exhibit C4 she wrote at the 
												time the couple were estranged 
												to say she was prepared to sell 
												this house and send the proceeds 
												to the Petitioner if he so 
												wished. The rationale behind the 
												proposal was that she did not 
												want him to think for a moment 
												that she had cheated or duped 
												him.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Of course, the respondent has 
												construed what she meant by your 
												house in the dispatches to the 
												Austrian husband. By that fond 
												expression of hers, she said 
												since she was the ultimate owner 
												the property also belonged to 
												the Petitioner by reason of 
												their common bond of interest. I 
												disagree. That explanation 
												hardly weighs with me. In the 
												circumstances shown above, the 
												principle underlying the 
												explanation has no merit. It is 
												nave simplistic and bogus. It 
												is, in my view, simply an after 
												thought. In the result of the 
												foregoing and particularly on 
												the respondent&#8217;s own showing, I 
												take the view that the 
												Petitioner is the undisputed 
												owner of H/No. A.52, Abura 
												Estate, Cape Coast and I 
												accordingly so hold&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												My Lords and brethren, I have 
												detained your precious time in 
												referring to the delivery of the 
												learned trial judge in order to 
												demonstrate that the attack 
												contained in the notice of 
												appeal herein is wholly 
												unjustified.&nbsp; I also think that 
												since I am in agreement with the 
												trial judge on the findings 
												which are contained in the 
												judgment, the subject matter of 
												this appeal it is important to 
												show to some extent reasons for 
												my agreement and in such a 
												circumstance I think I can do so 
												no better than in his own words, 
												the very words, the words in 
												which he expressed his finding 
												and by so doing express the 
												hollowness and indeed the 
												unjustifiable nature of the 
												criticism levelled against the 
												judgment. My Lords, that being 
												the position and after examining 
												the record of proceedings I have 
												come to the conclusion that the 
												learned trial judge considered 
												the case before him carefully, 
												and took into account all the 
												issues which turned upon the 
												same before coming to his 
												decision in a manner which I 
												must confess made a great 
												impression on me. Speaking for 
												myself I find no substance in 
												the grounds of appeal numbered 
												as 1, 2, and 4 which seek to 
												impeach the findings of fact and 
												I desire to spend no further 
												time on the said grounds and I 
												proceed to have the said grounds 
												dismissed. I think that to come 
												to any other conclusion on the 
												transcript before us would 
												amount to doing injustice to the 
												case as unfolded from the 
												evidence which pointed to one 
												direction namely that the 
												petitioner was entitled to 
												reliefs which the learned trial 
												judge granted in his favour.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There is yet another ground of 
												appeal which I have to consider. 
												The said ground numbered in the 
												notice of appeal as 3 is 
												expressed as follows:&#8221; that the 
												petitioner respondent being a 
												foreign national cannot be 
												entitled to the transfer of the 
												title ordered.&#8221; I must say 
												without any hesitation that I 
												have had great difficulty in 
												comprehending what learned 
												counsel for the appellant 
												actually intended by this 
												ground. I have after some 
												consideration come to the view 
												that the said ground like those 
												previously considered in this 
												delivery raises no point of 
												substance, it is but a baseless 
												attack on the order of the 
												learned trial judge directing 
												that the appellant in whose name 
												the disputed property namely 
												A/52 Abura Estate, Cape Coast is 
												conveyed to the respondent, who 
												on the admitted evidence was 
												found to have provided the funds 
												by which the house came to be 
												purchased with the title to the 
												said house I think that the 
												criticism levelled at the order 
												on the ground that since the 
												respondent is only enabled at 
												law, to take a leasehold of 
												50years the order made by the 
												learned trial judge by inference 
												is inviting the appellant to do 
												that which is in conflict with 
												the laws of the land. I do not 
												think so. On the contrary I am 
												of the view that it is a lawful 
												order, an order which by 
												operation of law having regard 
												to the nationality of the 
												respondent is limited to the 
												period provided by law which is 
												fifty years. To place any other 
												view on the said order which is 
												expressed in simple language is 
												to place an unnatural and 
												strained meaning on the same and 
												I have no doubt that the point 
												raised in the said ground is 
												unmeritorious and I am led to 
												the conclusion that the same be 
												dismissed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the result, I affirm the 
												judgment of the trial High 
												Court, Cape Coast together with 
												the consequential reliefs 
												therein granted and proceed to 
												have the respondent/appellant&#8217;s 
												appeal dismissed in its 
												entirety.</span></p>
