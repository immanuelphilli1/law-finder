						<span style="font-family: Arial">JUDGMENT</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">LAMPTEY, J.A.:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff 
						respondent Ex-Warrant Officer Adu Poku by his counsel 
						obtained leave of the High Court, Accra presided over by 
						Armah, J. on 29th May, 1992, to issue a writ of summons 
						accompanied by a Statement of Claim against the 
						defendant appellant company and for a further order to 
						serve same out of the jurisdiction.&nbsp; The appellant Co., 
						which is based in London on being duly served with 
						process on 6th July, 1992, instructed Solicitors in 
						Accra to act on his behalf. On 25th August, 1992, 
						solicitors for the appellant company filed a notice of 
						motion for an order discharging the order made by Armah, 
						J.&nbsp; The application was resisted by the plaintiff.&nbsp; It 
						was heard by Akoto Bamfo (Mrs.) J, who dismissed it.&nbsp; 
						The appellant company was aggrieved by the Ruling 
						dismissing the application and appealed to this court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Before I proceed to 
						deal with the instant appeal on the merits, I must draw 
						attention to what I believe to be an administrative 
						lapse which must and ought to be corrected.&nbsp; I find that 
						in respect of this application the Registrar opened two 
						separate and distinct case dockets.&nbsp; The first docket 
						bears the No.109/92 and the second is No. 1396/92.&nbsp; I 
						noticed that suit No. 109/92 dealt with the application 
						for leave to issue and serve the writ out of the 
						jurisdiction and all matters connected therewith 
						including the application to discharge Armah, J.&#8217;s 
						order.&nbsp; This suit No. 109/92 is the case on appeal 
						before this court.&nbsp; Suit No. 1396/92 is the substantive 
						action between the parties.&nbsp; The opening of two separate 
						and distinct case dockets had led to the exclusion from 
						the record of appeal the pleadings in the action which 
						would be found in the docket No. 1396/92, and therefore 
						not part&nbsp; of this appeal record.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have made the above 
						observation because the record of appeal does not 
						contain the entry of appearance under protest by the 
						appellant.&nbsp; One of the complaints made in this appeal 
						contred around the rules governing the entry of 
						appearance under protest.&nbsp; This court would have been 
						better placed to deal with this compliant if the record 
						of appeal contained all the documents and pleadings in 
						that matter.&nbsp; I find that the affidavit in support of 
						the application to set aside the service of the writ 
						gave the date of the entry of appearance under protest 
						as 30th July, 1992. I have no reason to disbelieve that 
						information.&nbsp; The significance of this date would become 
						obvious when I come to deal with the complaint that the 
						application to discharge the order of Armah, J dated 9th 
						May, 1992 was made out of time.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The applicant did not 
						indicate the rule under which the present application 
						was brought in arguing the motion.&nbsp; 0.11 of our rules is 
						not different in content from the English 0.11.&nbsp; Indeed 
						our rule is a reproduction of the English rule in 
						point.&nbsp; The courts of England have decided a number of 
						cases founded on 0.11.&nbsp; This court was referred to one 
						case, namely, Annin Rashieed Shipping Corp.&nbsp; vrs: Kuwait 
						Insurance Co. reported in the Weekly Law Reports, July 
						22, 1983, House of Lords.&nbsp; I reproduce holding (1) as 
						follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;(1) That the proper 
						law of the contract was English Law&#8230;&#8230;. since the 
						provisions of the policy taken as a whole by necessary 
						implication led to the inevitable conclusion that it was 
						the parties intention that their mutual rights and 
						obligations under it should be determined in accordance 
						with the English law of marine insurance.&nbsp; The court 
						held further that objectively determined the contract 
						had its closest and most real connection with English 
						Law.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Before this court 
						Counsel for applicant was of the view that the 
						application had not been brought under 0.11 R.1. It 
						would appear that the court was invited to consider the 
						application &#8220;in the name of equity.&#8221;&nbsp; In his reply, 
						counsel for the plaintiff submitted that Ghana was the 
						&#8220;forum conveniens&#8221; because according to him the 
						plaintiff had no money to litigate in the U.K.&nbsp; He 
						stated that if the application was granted the plaintiff 
						&#8220;would be without remedy.&#8221; He relied on 0.11 to oppose 
						the application.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As I have already 
						indicated elsewhere in this judgment the record of 
						appeal does not contain the entry of appearance under 
						protest.&nbsp; It does appear that on being served with the 
						writ of summons and statement of claim the step taken by 
						the appellant company was to instruct their Solicitor to 
						file a motion of notice to discharge the order to Armah, 
						J.&nbsp; This step the solicitor took by filing the motion of 
						notice on 25th August, 1992.&nbsp; One complaint made against 
						the Ruling was that the judge erred in holding that the 
						application was brought out of time. Counsel for 
						appellant submitted that she erred in law in reaching 
						that conclusion.&nbsp; He argued that the period of the legal 
						vacation did not count in computing time limited for 
						filing of process.&nbsp; He stated that the appellant&#8217;s 
						application was properly before the court.&nbsp; In reply, 
						counsel for plaintiff argued that the application should 
						have been brought within 14 days calculated from the 
						date appellant Co. entered conditional appearance. The 
						application was filed outside of the 14 days and the 
						judge was right in dismissing it.&nbsp; He concluded that the 
						application did not come within the exceptions spelt out 
						in the rule.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the light of the 
						submission and arguments of counsel for parties.sic (,)&nbsp; 
						I reproduce the relevant provision of o.12 R.24 as 
						follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;12(24) A defendant 
						before appearing shall be at liberty, without obtaining 
						an order to enter or entering a conditional appearance, 
						to take out a summons or service of notice of motion to 
						set aside the service upon him of the writ or notice of 
						the writ or to discharge the order authoring such 
						service.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The rule does not 
						provide that the summons or the notice to set aside must 
						be taken within 14 days upon the service of the writ or 
						notice of writ.&nbsp; The above rule is so plain and clear 
						that it does not call for comment or observation.&nbsp; The 
						bone of contention in this case is whether or not the 
						appellant can invoke 0[sic].64 R.4 which provides as 
						follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;64(4) The times of the 
						vacation in any years shall not be reckoned in the 
						computation of the times appointed or allowed by these 
						rules for amending, delivering, or filling [sic] any 
						pleading unless otherwise directed by the Court or a 
						judge.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel for plaintiff 
						contended that a motion on notice to set aside the writ 
						was not one for &#8220;amending delivering or filing any 
						pleadings&#8221; hence the application should have been filed 
						within 14 days, during the legal vacation.&nbsp; Counsel for 
						appellant argued the contrary. In considering the above 
						issue the trial judge expressed the following opinion:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;There are no 
						provisions under our rules for appearance under 
						oritest&#8221;. With great respect, the trial judge erred in 
						law when she held that the rules of court do not contain 
						a provision relating to an appearance under protest.&nbsp; I 
						have elsewhere in this judgment pointed out that there 
						is provision under 0[sic].12 R.24 for entry of 
						appearance under protest. The method prescribed by the 
						rules is either by summons or in the alternative by 
						motion on notice. There is no time limit for taking out 
						a summons or applying by motion on notice, to set aside. 
						In the instant case, the motion to set aside was filed 
						during the legal vacation, when time does not run; 
						meaning that, that is frozen for purposes of computing 
						time limits. In my view, what the rules seek to do is to 
						ensure that for purposes of computing time pursuant to 
						the rules the period of the legal vacation cannot and 
						must not be taken into account. In the instant case, 
						appearance was entered for the appellant company on 
						July, 1992, the appellant was not obliged to file a 
						statement of defence during the legal vacation. 0.[sic] 
						21 R.6 gave the appellant company 14 days within which 
						to file a statement of defence.&nbsp; The means in effect 
						that the appellant must file a statement of defence 
						before the 13th October, 1992.&nbsp; The application to set 
						aside the writ in my view must be governed by the same 
						rule, because the fate of such an application would 
						determine whether or not the substantive plaint should 
						proceed according to the rules.&nbsp; I find that the trial 
						judge erred in holding that the application to set aside 
						the writ and the service of the writ out of the 
						jurisdiction was incompetent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The other ground of 
						appeal argued was that the judge erred in refusing the 
						application on the merits.&nbsp; Counsel for appellant 
						submitted that on the facts before the court the proper 
						law of the contract of carriage was English law.&nbsp; He 
						argued that the English Court was the court clothed with 
						jurisdiction to hear and determine the plaint.&nbsp; He 
						recited the matters which support his submission that 
						the Ghanaian Courts have no jurisdiction and cannot 
						assume jurisdiction in the matter.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In reply, counsel for 
						plaintiff submitted that the lower court was clothed 
						with jurisdiction.&nbsp; He described the court below as the 
						&#8220;forum convenience.&#8221;&nbsp; To hear and determine the case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the issue of 
						jurisdiction in such cases, there is wealth of 
						respectable authority both local and foreign.&nbsp; A local 
						case to which our attention was drawn is the Court of 
						Appeal case of Society General de Compensation vrs: 
						Ackerman (1972) 1 E.L.R.[sic] 413 at holdings (1) (2) 
						(3) as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;(1) the proper law of 
						a contract is the system of law by which the parties 
						intended the contract to be governed, or where their 
						intention is neither expressed nor to be inferred from 
						the circumstances, that system of law with which the 
						transaction has its closest and most real connection.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The court proceeded to 
						offer guide lines on the ascertainment of the proper law 
						at holdings (2) and (3) thus:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;(2) The mode of 
						judicial ascertainment of the proper law of a contract 
						is, in the absence of express choice of a system of law, 
						the objective and pragamatic one of applying the 
						external standard of the reasonable man of business and 
						then considering what the parties ought to have intended 
						had they considered the question of the proper law when 
						the contract was executed.&nbsp; Dicta of Singletion L.J. in 
						the Assunziene (1954) 1 ALL E.R.278 at pp 289 and 292.
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(3) The court is also 
						assisted in ascertaining the proper law by certain 
						well-known presumptions such as the &#8220;lex loci 
						contractus&#8221; and &#8220;lex loci solutions&#8221; which are neither 
						irrebuttable [sic] nor arbitrary.&#8221; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The principle of law 
						enunciated in the above case has been applied in a 
						number of cases in this country. What then would the 
						reasonable man of business find as the proper law of the 
						contract in the instant case. The undisputed facts are 
						that both the appellant company and the plaintiff 
						entered into the contract in England, in the premises of 
						the Ghana High Commission in London. The consideration 
						to support the contract was paid in English money. The 
						contract was frustrated and breached in London, 
						England.&nbsp; Both the appellant company and the plaintiff 
						were at the date and time of the breach resident in 
						London. The reasonable man of business would expect the 
						plaintiff to sue the appellant company in London and 
						most certainly not to sue in Ghana. It seems to me that 
						the fact only that the plaintiff returned to Ghana some 
						time after all these events cannot be a factor to 
						consider in determining the proper law of the contract.&nbsp; 
						In this case all that the plaintiff stated on this issue 
						would be found at paragraphs 3 and 4 of the affidavit in 
						support of the application.&nbsp; Paragraphs 3 and 4 read 
						thus:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;3. On 23 December, 
						1991, I gave a letter to the Defendants with express 
						instructions that they be delivered to my superiors in 
						Accra.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">4. Contrary to my 
						instructions Defendant wrongfully delivered the said 
						letter to my superior officer in London.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is clear from the 
						above that the letter never left London. The contract 
						was thus breached and frustrated in London. The 
						plaintiff&#8217;s right to sue the respondent company accrued 
						immediately the contract was breached in London. In my 
						opinion it would be unconscionable to hold that the 
						plaintiff should travel to Ghana to prosecute his claim 
						on the undisputed facts.&nbsp; The plaintiff at paragraph 4 
						deposed as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;(4) In the events that 
						followed I was ordered to return to Ghana.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He did not disclose in 
						his affidavit &#8220;the events that followed&#8221;. He therefore 
						did not disclose to the court those matters which would 
						assist the court in deciding that the proper law of the 
						contract was other than English Law.&nbsp; As to what matters 
						an affidavit in support of an application under 
						0[sic].11 must contain the 1962 Annual Practice Provides 
						as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Though the applicant 
						need only establish a &#8220;prima facie&#8221; or &#8220;good arguable 
						case,&#8221; the affidavit should contain a full statement of 
						the facts on which the application is based, and which 
						justify the issue of the writ and the statement must be 
						frank.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I find that the 
						affidavit in support of the application fell far short 
						of what was required under 0.[sic] 11. It did not 
						contain a full and frank statement of &#8220;the events that 
						followed the breach.&#8221;&nbsp; In my opinion the omission and 
						failure to make a full and frank statement of matters 
						which would have assisted the judge to determine the 
						proper law and the &#8220;forum coveniens&#8221; was fatal to the 
						application.&nbsp; I so find.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was submitted that 
						the statement of defence filed by the appellant amounted 
						to an admission of the claim of the respondent.&nbsp; I must 
						observe that I do not share the view that the fact of 
						admitting the claim is a ground or reason for conferring 
						jurisdiction on the court.&nbsp; It is trite learning that 
						the issue of jurisdiction is a matter of law.&nbsp; In this 
						case the appellant did not admit the whole of the claim 
						of the respondent. A careful reading of Exhibit &#8220;AP2&#8221; 
						shows that the appellant did not admit the case put 
						forward by the plaintiff.&nbsp; The relevant portion of &#8220;AP2&#8221; 
						reads thus:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;..At this point I 
						would like to say that your client&#8217;s version and my 
						currier&#8217;s version of what took place (in London) seem to 
						be in perfect accord except for one point&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The language used above 
						is plain and clear.&nbsp; It drew attention to a disagreement 
						between the parties &#8220;on one point&#8221;.&nbsp; In my case the 
						reference here is to matters that took place in London 
						and not in Ghana.&nbsp; These matters cannot clothe the lower 
						court with jurisdiction.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Another complaint, made 
						against the Ruling was that the judge erred in law in 
						relying on the case of Chatteney vrs The Brazilian 
						Sub-Marine Co. Ltd. (1891) 1 Q.B.D.89. She held that the 
						lower court was the &#8220;forum conveniens&#8221; because, Ghana 
						was the place of performance of the contract.&nbsp; In my 
						opinion the trial judge&#8217;s reliance solely on a passage 
						from the Chatteney case misled her into applying the 
						wrong principle of law to the fact of this case. In the 
						instant case, the parties did not expressly state the 
						law which was to govern their contract. The presumption 
						that the law of Ghana was to govern the contract was 
						rebuttable. An objective test to apply was whether or 
						not the parties intended the law of Ghana to govern the 
						contract.&nbsp; My answer is that the parties intended 
						English law to govern the contract. My simple reason is 
						that it would be absurd for plaintiff who at all 
						material time lived and resided in London and who 
						expected to continue to live and reside in London after 
						he had handed the letter to appellant company in London 
						to travel to Ghana to sue the appellant company then 
						resident in London in the event that company breached 
						the contract. In order to sue the appellant company in 
						Ghana in instant case the plaintiff must disclose to the 
						Ghanaian court full and frank matters which would make 
						Ghana the &#8220;forum competens and convenience&#8221;. I have not 
						been persuaded that the delivery of the letter in London 
						rather than in Ghana led to the recall of plaintiff back 
						to Ghana:&nbsp; I have not found from the affidavit evidence 
						that the delivery of the letter to an officer in London 
						resulted in the premature retirement of the plaintiff 
						from the Ghana Army.&nbsp; I have no evidence before me to 
						prove and establish the fact that the failure of 
						appellant company to deliver the letter in Ghana 
						resulted in the plaintiff&#8217;s inability to continue and 
						complete a professional accounting course in London.&nbsp; 
						The above matter which were not tested by 
						cross-examination which the plaintiff swore to in his 
						affidavit in support unduly impressed the trial judge 
						and misled her into holding that the parties intended 
						the law of Ghana to govern the contract of carriage.&nbsp; 
						With respect, she erred in considering matters which are 
						plainly and clearly extraneous.&nbsp; I therefore allow the 
						appeal.&nbsp; I set aside the Ruling of the lower court. I 
						enter judgment for the appellant company.</span></p>
