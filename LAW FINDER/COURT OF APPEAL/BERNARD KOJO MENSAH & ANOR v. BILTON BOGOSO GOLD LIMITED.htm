						<span style="font-family: Arial">WOOD, JA:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 
						plaintiff/Respondents were working as night duty 
						watchmen at Chujah&nbsp; crossing on the defendant/appellant 
						company&#8217;s gold concession, when one of the company&#8217;s&nbsp; 
						truck and a hired mini bus were involved in a 
						collision.&nbsp; The company alleged the accident was as a 
						result of their negligence and so declared them 
						off-site.&nbsp; In practical terms, their services were 
						dispensed with forthwith.&nbsp; Claiming that they were 
						employees, they sued them for a declaration that their 
						dismissal was wrongful, prayed the court for the sum of 
						¢10 million as compensation for the said act and for any 
						other appropriate orders. Clearly dissatisfied with the 
						decision of the trial court, which gave to each 
						respondent ¢4,470,00 as damages for wrongful dismissal, 
						the appellants have appealed to us in this court on the 
						following grounds: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">a)&nbsp; &#8220;That the judgment 
						is against the weight of evidence adduced at the trial.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">b)&nbsp; That the High Court 
						against the weight of evidence adduced at the trial 
						erred in holding that the Plaintiffs were employees of 
						the Defendant company.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">c)&nbsp; That the High Court 
						in the absence of a contract of employment or any other 
						relevant evidence erred in holding that the defendant 
						had wrongfully dismissed the Plaintiffs.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">d)&nbsp; That the High Court 
						erred in awarding damages for wrongful dismissal on the 
						basis of the evidence before it.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At the hearing, 
						Appellants stoutly denied the respondents contention 
						that they were at all material times in their 
						employment.&nbsp; They denied the existence of any legal bond 
						between the two of them and described them as employees 
						of Emanet Services (Emanet), independent contractors, 
						engaged by them (appellants) to provide security 
						services.&nbsp; The distinction between the two different 
						relationships is of basic legal importance. The 
						relationship asserted by the respondent is a contract of 
						service.&nbsp; As a result, a&nbsp; fundamental and thorny issue 
						which arose for determination in the court below, and 
						which indeed also arises for our consideration in this 
						appeal, is whether or not the appellant company&nbsp; 
						employed the respondents under a contract of service.&nbsp; 
						The learned trial judge found they were, basing his 
						decision on the following: Exhibit G, a testimonial 
						given them by the appellant company, the fact that 
						following a letter written by the appellants headed 
						Bilton Bogoso Gold Ltd., they handed over company kit, 
						which was in their custody, Exhibit E, an investigative 
						report prepared by the company following the accident 
						that led to their dismissal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is this finding 
						which has come under attack as being against the weight 
						of evidence. It was submitted that at common law, the 
						test for determining whether a person is an employee is 
						dependent on whether there exists a contract of service 
						or one of services. The test laid down in Ready Mixed 
						Concrete v. Minister of Pensions and National Insurance&nbsp; 
						(1968) 2 Q.B. 515 and in which Mac Kenna J, analysed a 
						contract of service in some detail and concluded that to 
						qualify as one, three necessary conditions must be met.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel argued that 
						since the 1st respondent corroborated the appellants&#8217; 
						assertion that Emanet was contracted to provide security 
						services, and they were unable to produce their 
						appointment letters at the trial, nor clearly state the 
						terms and conditions of their employment, the finding 
						was clearly erroneous.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The undisputed facts 
						are that at all material times; the respondents worked 
						on the appellants company&#8217;s premises as security 
						watchmen.&nbsp; The question of whether an employment 
						relationship is a contract of service or of services is 
						a question of mixed fact and law and is dealt with on a 
						case by case basis.&nbsp; No one single test is decisive, as 
						was emphasised in Argent v. Minister of Social Security 
						(1968) 3 ALL E.R. 208.&nbsp; Halsburys Laws of England, Third 
						Edition, Volume 25, defines contract of service as &#8220;one 
						in which a person undertakes to service another and to 
						obey his reasonable orders within the scope of the duty 
						undertaken.&#8221; Many factors are therefore taken into 
						account in determining the question, the acid test being 
						that which was advocated in the Ready Mixed Contract 
						case.&nbsp; His Lordship&#8217;s most instructive speech at page 
						513 is as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220; A contract of service 
						exists if these three conditions are fulfilled.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(i) The servant agrees 
						that in consideration of a wage or other remuneration, 
						he will provide his own work and skill the performance 
						of some service for his master.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(ii) He agrees, 
						expressly or impliedly that in the performance of that 
						service subject to the other&#8217;s control in a sufficient 
						degree to make that other master.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(iii)&nbsp; The other 
						provisions are consistent with its being a contract of 
						service&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I intend to be guided 
						by this basic test, which was accepted by Lord Widgery, 
						C.J, in Global Plant, Ltd. v. Secretary of State for 
						Health and Social Security (1972) 1Q.B 139, as well as 
						the undoubtedly sound counsel of Cooke J, when dealing 
						with the vexed question of the appropriate test in 
						Construction Training Board v. Labour Force, Ltd., 
						(1973) 3 AII E.R. 220.&nbsp; He reasoned that,</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;First, that no list of 
						test which has been formulated is exhaustive,&nbsp; and that 
						the weight to be attached to particular criteria varies 
						from case to case. Secondly, although the extent of the 
						control which the alleged employer is entitled to 
						exercise over the work is by no means a decisive 
						criterion of universal application, it is likely in many 
						cases to be a factor of importance&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the particular facts 
						of this case, the trial judge was right in concluding&nbsp; 
						that the respondents were employees of the appellant 
						company.&nbsp; True they&nbsp; were unable to produce their 
						appointment letters. Their production might have made 
						their case easier to deal with.&nbsp; But there are other 
						pieces of documentary evidence clearly pointing to the 
						existence of that contractual relationship.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Both respondents were 
						emphatic that they were employed and dismissed by the 
						appellants. For the 1st, the unchallenged evidence shows 
						that he was employed in 1991, at which point in time 
						Emanet had not been established, and dismissed at a time 
						it had ceased to exist.&nbsp; The contract document on which 
						the appellants rely, exhibit I came into effect in 
						October 1992. Emanet may well have entered into an 
						agreement with the appellants to provide the services 
						stated therein, but, there being no evidence from the 
						appellants that there was a mutual agreement between 
						them and the 1st respondent at the inception of Emanet 
						that he transfers to them, it would clearly&nbsp; be in error 
						to hold that he is their employee.&nbsp; Again, he swore that 
						in his employment with the company he was being paid 
						¢298,000.00.&nbsp; The Exh. A, his payroll for June 1996, 
						headed BILTON BOGOSO GOLD LIMITED WATCHMAN DETAILED 
						PAYROLL JUNE 1996. Clearly corroborate his assertion 
						that he was indeed in their employment.&nbsp; Also the Exh. 
						B, the appellants letter which declared him off site.&nbsp; 
						Finally, the Exh. B, a testimonial issued by the company 
						to him and whose opening paragraph I believe must be 
						reproduced, for it confirms their stated position. It 
						reads:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;This is to certify 
						that MR. BERNARD KOJO MENSAH, was employed and worked as 
						a security Watchman at Bogoso Gold Limited, from JANUARY 
						1991-JUNE 1996.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In fairness to the 
						respondents,&nbsp; Mr. Sam Crabbe, the author of the exhibit 
						attempted to explain the circumstances under which he 
						came to write it. He explained that although he did not 
						know the applicant, and he also did not have a clue 
						about his employment history, he was nevertheless moved 
						on humanitarian grounds to write it, after two officials 
						have confirmed he worked as a watchman, with one 
						actually volunteering information that he worked with 
						Emanet, a company on contract with&nbsp; Bogoso.&nbsp; That being 
						the case, why did he write the testimonial in the first 
						place?&nbsp; If he were on compassionate grounds minded to, 
						as he would have us believe, why did he not state the 
						facts as were narrated to him, namely, that he was 
						employed by Emanet to provide the service, but&nbsp; wrote 
						that, he was employed by Bogoso.&nbsp; Frankly, I find it a 
						bit hard to believe that his highly placed security 
						officer, who confesses he did not know the applicant 
						conducted the exercise without calling for his personal 
						file. I find his explanation threadbare. The 
						circumstances under which under the principle of prior 
						self contradiction, a witnesses credibility may not be 
						impeached has been outlined in Asia v. VA Yeduvor and 
						Another, (1987-88) 1GLR 175.&nbsp; This court, unanimously 
						speaking, held that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;&#8230;a prior inconsistent 
						statement, if not satisfactorily explained as to the 
						circumstances under which it was made (e.g. duress or a 
						mistake), would go to impeach credit on a particular 
						fact.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I find Mr. Crabbe&#8217;s 
						explanation neither credible nor satisfactory. I find 
						all three conditions set out in the Ready Mixed Concrete 
						case present in the 1st respondent&#8217;s case.&nbsp; The 
						appellants remunerated him as he provided the necessary 
						work and skill.&nbsp; They superintended the work and 
						controlled the manner in which it was to be done&#8212;where 
						it was to be done, he was at first posted at the&nbsp; 
						bungalows, but subsequently shifted to Chujah.&nbsp; Again, 
						they provided necessary tools for doing it, not to 
						mention that he was subject to the mines safety 
						regulation.&nbsp; The order to the finance department 
						directing them to withhold his salary for the months of 
						May and June 96, until he has returned all of the 
						company&#8217;s property in his custody supports the view that 
						he is directly on their payroll and also that they 
						control him.&nbsp; Otherwise, the respondents would surely 
						have dealt directly with Emanet, the 
						independent-contractor who in any event were, 
						surprisingly not&nbsp; produced by the appellants to 
						corroborate their assertion that respondents were indeed 
						their employees.&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Were there any other 
						terms of the contract consistent with a contract of 
						service? Yes.&nbsp; The Exh. A shows he obtained meals 
						allowance, while tax and social security contributions 
						were deducted at source, in clear contradistinction to 
						the rule that applies to casual workers&nbsp; under Exh. 1</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Much the same 
						inferences and conclusions could be drawn in favour of 
						the 2nd respondent who led similar evidence. He was 
						emphatic that he was in the employment of the respondent 
						during which period he received salary for work done as 
						evidenced by the Exh. D and I.&nbsp; Further that they not 
						only supplied him with working tools, but also 
						controlled the manner in which the work was to be done.&nbsp; 
						The absence of an employment letter notwithstanding, he 
						re-affirmed his stated position under cross-examination 
						as the following would show.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp; Are you aware that 
						Mr. Anthony is now officer of Emanet Services</span></p>

						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t tell</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp; Were you employed 
						by Anthony</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp; No</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q. Who employed you</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp; Mr. Ayalipar of 
						Bilton Bogoso Ltd.&nbsp; He was Chief Security.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp; Were you given 
						number as an employee</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp; Yes</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp; Are you aware that 
						Exhibit A makes no mention of the employee number.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp; It is up to them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">While it is true that 
						the initial burden of proving that they are appellants 
						lay on them, I am satisfied that&nbsp; they discharged that 
						burden satisfactorily. On the contrary, I think the 
						appellants woefully failed to discharge the evidentiary 
						burden which then shifted to them.&nbsp; All they did, 
						contrary to the well known principle in Majo lagbe v, 
						Larbei, fully explained and digested in Zabrama Segbezi 
						(1991)2 GLR 221 was to mount the witness box, deny the 
						assertion and point to the Exh I as the evidence of a 
						contract of Services between them and Emanet. That may 
						well be so, but the critical question is this: at the 
						crucial date of the accident in whose employment were 
						the respondents?&nbsp; I cannot imagine that for this well 
						reputed and highly organized mining company, they could 
						not produce one single documentary evidence from Emanet 
						showing that respondents were their employees but who 
						were being assigned to them for security services.&nbsp; Are 
						we being made to believe that Emanet simply dumped them 
						on to the company without formally introducing them? The 
						terms of the 2nd respondents contract is in my view 
						consistent with a contract of service.&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Did the appellants&#8217; 
						action amount to a dismissal? Certainly yes. Two 
						arguments were advanced in support of the proposition 
						that what happened cannot amount to a dismissal- what&nbsp; 
						weak arguments.&nbsp; The first, namely that they were 
						declared off site in accordance with Exh. I can be 
						easily dismissed on the grounds that I have already 
						found they are not employees of Emanet and so the terms 
						are inapplicable to them.&nbsp; The second is that the letter 
						was not written or signed by the General Manager or any 
						duly mandated officer of the appellant.&nbsp; The least said 
						about the letter which came from the chief&nbsp; security 
						officer of the company the better.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was never the 
						company&#8217;s position that the Exhibit was written by an 
						unauthorized person. In any case that assertion runs 
						counter to what appellants own senior Investigative 
						Officer deposed to on 30th November 1999 viz that &#8220;their 
						appointments&#8221; were &#8220;terminated&#8221; forthwith, the clear 
						meaning being &#8220;that Bilton Bogoso Gold Ltd no longer 
						needs their services and therefore should not come to 
						the concession.&#8221; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Obviously, their own 
						views that they were clearly negligent is very much more 
						consistent with a dismissal that is, a summary 
						determination of the contract of service.&nbsp; It is 
						difficult to faction why the appellants are running away 
						from this simple truth.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Was the dismissal 
						justified?&nbsp; Again the evidence is overwhelming.&nbsp; The 
						appellants on whom lay the burden of proving lawful 
						justification failed totally to justify their action.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In their statement of 
						defence, they have clearly accused them of negligence.&nbsp; 
						(see paragraphs 6, 8 and 9). The 8 is particularly so 
						serious, I am forced to reproduce it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The defendant in 
						further denial of paragraph 9 of the statement of the 
						plaintiffs statement of claim avers that the second 
						plaintiff at the time of the said collision was not at 
						this designated duty post but was sleeping elsewhere&#8221;.&nbsp;
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In spite of these 
						serious allegations, not once were these acts of gross 
						negligence suggested to them while they were in the 
						witness box to enable them deny or accept them.&nbsp; I am 
						not unmindful of this courts decision in Nartey v. Botwe 
						(1989-90) 1 GLR 479 which lays out the exceptions to the 
						rule on failure to cross-examine.&nbsp; The appellants do not 
						fall under any of the exceptions and their failure to 
						put their case across through cross-examination cannot 
						be justified in any way in the circumstances.&nbsp; Worse 
						still, they failed to lead a shred of credible evidence 
						in proof (legal proof) of their allegation that the 
						accident occurred as a result of the respondent&#8217;s 
						negligence and in circumstances that justify their 
						instant dismissal.&nbsp; In any case the charges of 
						negligence is clearly inconsistent with the Exhs. C and 
						G, which described the respondents in glowing 
						terms&#8212;hardworking and obedient workmen.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The respondents may 
						well have been watchmen, but clearly theirs was a 
						contract indefinite as&nbsp; to duration.&nbsp; In the absence of 
						agreement or custom (that was not the appellants case) 
						their contracts are terminable by reasonable notice, as 
						is the positions generally for all contracts of service. 
						Lord Alverstone CJ&nbsp; in Re African Association, Ltd and 
						Aden, 1910 1KB 396 summed up the law as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The general principle 
						applicable to contract of service is that, in the 
						absence of misconduct or of grounds specified in the 
						contract, the engagement can only be terminated after 
						reasonable notice&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We think a month&#8217;s 
						notice reasonable for a night watchman.&nbsp; This is because 
						what constitutes reasonable notice is a question 
						determinable on the facts of each given case.&nbsp; In one 
						case, twelve months was reasonable.&nbsp; He was a chief 
						engineer of an ocean liner (Savage v. British India 
						Steam Navigation Co Ltd 1930, 46T LR 294), while in the 
						case of a hairdresser assistant, one week was held to be 
						reasonable (Mambens v. Leon) 1919 KB 208. There is 
						everything to show from the self evident Exh B that it 
						was a dismissal retrospective at that, not a termination 
						on reasonable notice.&nbsp; The respondents are therefore 
						entitled to damages.&nbsp; At this rehearing however, we do 
						agree that the trial judge failed to state the factors 
						which he relied on in arriving at the period of 15 
						months this makes the damages awarded arbitrary. We will 
						reduce it to 5 months on the basis that probabilities of 
						his obtaining employment elsewhere as a 
						security/watchman is not as low as if they were not in 
						possession of such favourable testimonials and they had 
						happened to mining Engineers. They have not proved that 
						they are entitled to any other benefit.&nbsp; The measure of 
						damages would therefore be assessed at ¢298000.00 x 6 
						months (1 month reasonable + 5 months period within 
						which they could secure alternative employment.&nbsp; Thus 
						works out at ¢1,788000.00 with costs assessed at ¢2,00m 
						in favour of each respondent.</span></p>
