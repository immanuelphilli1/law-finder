						<font face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US">This is an appeal 
						against the judgment of the High Court, Accra dated the 
						31st October 2008, dismissing the plaintiff action and 
						entering judgment for the defendant on his counterclaim. 
						The plaintiff is thus the appellant herein and the 
						defendant is the respondent. The appellant per the writ 
						issued on 28-1-93 claimed the following:- a. Recovery of 
						an amount of ¢110,175,349.74 b. Interest at the current 
						bank rate from 31/7/92 to date of final payment c. 
						General damages for breach of contract In a terse 
						statement of claim of 7 paragraphs, the appellant simply 
						alleged that it supplied goods to the respondent between 
						August 1990 to July 1992 worth ¢203,656,469.08. However, 
						in July 1992 when the respondent's account was audited 
						his indebtedness stood at ¢110,175,349.74. The appellant 
						further averred that the respondent had failed to settle 
						the said indebtedness notwithstanding repeated 
						demands.The respondent disputed the claim and filed a 28 
						paragraph statement of defence and counterclaimed for 
						the following: a. The sum of ¢6,772,000 being an amount 
						wrongfully withheld by the plaintiff since November 
						1992. b. Interest on the said sum at the prevailing bank 
						rate from November 1992 till the date of final payment. 
						By respondent's defence and counterclaim the appellant 
						was compelled to file a 9 paragraph reply and defence to 
						the counterclaim which was later amended on 18-8-95: 
						From the pleadings exchanged by the parties it is 
						obvious that the appellant in his statement of claim 
						suppressed material facts which formed the basis of the 
						dispute. As the pleadings showed the amount claimed by 
						the appellant was not a simple debt arising out of goods 
						supplied and unpaid. Rather the real facts were that the 
						appellant's Chief Accountant one Isaac Forson in the 
						course of respondent's dealings with the appellant 
						company, had instructed the respondent to be paying the 
						cost of his supplies to him, the Chief Accountant, so 
						that respondent's orders would be processed promptly. As 
						a result the respondent was prevailed upon by the Chief 
						Accountant and he paid cash and issued corresponding 
						cheques to the Chief Accountant as payment for his 
						orders. Respondent after tendering the cash and 
						corresponding cheques to the Chief Accountant continued 
						to receive his supplies without any problems, till in 
						July 1992 when his account was audited and it came to 
						light that the Chief Accountant was not crediting the 
						respondent account with the cash. When the cheques 
						issued to the Chief Accountant were presented they were 
						dishonoured, hence the debt of ¢110,175,349.74 against 
						the Respondent. The respondent reported the Chief 
						Accountant to the management of appellant company and he 
						admitted that he failed to credit respondent account 
						with the cash he received from him. The Chief Accountant 
						then gave an undertakig to settle the amount due on the 
						respondent account. After this event, the appellant 
						requested the respondent to continue the business as a 
						result the respondent deposited an amount of ¢6,772,000 
						to the appellant for further supplies. Appellant later 
						sought to treat the amount of ¢6,772,000 as payments 
						made by the respondent to settle part of the debt the 
						Chief Accountant had undertaken to settle as narrated 
						above. The ¢6,772,000.00 forms the basis of respondent's 
						counterclaim.From the facts narrated above it is clear 
						that appellant did suppress material facts from its 
						statement of claim which portrayed the dispute as a case 
						of the respondent taking delivery of goods and simply 
						refusing to pay for them. Appellant's statement of claim 
						as formulated was contrary to the general rules of 
						pleadings and that practice ought to be deprecated. At 
						the end of the trial appellant's claim was dismissed and 
						respondent's counterclaim was upheld by the trial court. 
						This appeal is thus against the dismissal of the 
						appellant's claim with a prayer that this court sets 
						aside the judgment of the court below and judgment 
						entered for appellant. In the original Notice of Appeal 
						filed on the 22-1-2009, the appellant raised four 
						grounds of appeal namely: i. The judgment is against the 
						weight of evidence II. The cost of GH¢10,0O0.00 is 
						excessive and unjustifiable iii. That the court erred 
						when it failed to hold that the defendant perpetrated 
						fraud on the plaintiffs when he issued dud cheques, for 
						goods collected from the plaintiff and in some cases 
						connived with some officials of plaintiff to suppress 
						the clearance of cheques. iv. The court erred when it 
						failed to hold that the counterclaim of GH¢667.20 was 
						part payment of goods collected during the audit of the 
						defendants accounts with the plaintiff. Pursuant to 
						notice in the Notice of Appeal that additional grounds 
						of appeal would be filed, the appellant sought leave and 
						same was granted it on the 12-4-2010 to file additional 
						grounds. Appellant then filed what he called two 
						additional grounds on the 13-4-2010 namely:- v. Whether 
						or not the defendant's prosecution of Isaac Forson for 
						fraud against him in the sum being claimed by the 
						plaintiff against the defendant disables him from 
						raising the defence of payment to the agent of the 
						company on behalf of the company. vi. Whether or not in 
						law the defendant can claim the benefit of the judgment 
						in a criminal proceeding for fraud against him as 
						complainant and dispute his liability in the civil suit 
						in the circumstance of his case. I shall first address 
						the additional grounds stated above and ask whether 
						these are grounds of appeal properly so called? In other 
						words are these grounds of appeal allowed by the rules 
						of this court? I think as counsel for respondent rightly 
						contended in his statement of case the above additional 
						grounds are very irregular. By those grounds of appeal, 
						appellant sought to present determinable issues as 
						grounds of appeal. Those grounds as formulated do not 
						disclose any determination of issues raised therein by 
						the trial court for which this court had to re-examine. 
						Simply put those issues formulated as grounds of appeal 
						are such that it ought to have been raised at the court 
						below for their determination, so they could be examined 
						by this court. In our jurisdiction even though appeals 
						are of right they are regulated by statute, for that 
						matter parties who seek to prosecute appeals ought to 
						comply with the statute that govern procedures for 
						prosecuting such appeals. This court is regulated by the 
						Court of Appeal Rules 1997, C.l 19 as amended, in its 
						proceedings and parties invoking the jurisdiction of 
						this court must conform to its rules. Rule 8 of C.l 19 
						provides as follow:- &quot;(5) The grounds of appeal shall 
						set out concisely and under distinct heads the grounds 
						on which the appellant intends to rely at the earing of 
						the appeal without an argument or a narrative and shall 
						be numbered consecutively. (6) A ground which is vague 
						or general in terms or which does not disclose a 
						reasonable ground of appeal is not permitted, except the 
						general ground that the judgment is against the weight 
						of the evidence. (7) A ground of appeal or a part of the 
						appeal which is not permitted under sub rule (6) may be 
						struck out by the court of its own motion or on 
						application by the Respondent&quot; As observed the 
						additional grounds so filed are not grounds but issues 
						raised for determination for the first time. This is not 
						a court of first instance even though an appeal is by 
						way of rehearing. I am of the opinion that grounds of 
						appeal can only arise from issues raised and determined 
						one way or the other by a trial court. A ground of 
						appeal should not take the form of issues for the 
						appellate court to try, as if this court is one of first 
						instance. I find the two additional issues very 
						irregular and I will strike them out. They are 
						accordingly struck out. I will turn to the original 
						grounds of appeal. The first is that the judgment is 
						against the weight of evidence. What this ground means 
						is that the trial court failed to properly consider the 
						evidence adduced at the trial or that the findings made 
						by the trial court are not supported by evidence on 
						record, either that it had excluded matters which were 
						relevant in law for the determination of the action. 
						Upon the examination of the record of appeal, the 
						resolution of the dispute at the court below depended on 
						a fundamental issue whether or not the monies paid by 
						the respondent to appellant's Chief Accountant could be 
						deemed as payments received by the appellant, for which 
						reason the respondent's account was to be credited. In 
						resolving that issue, the trial court had to consider 
						the import and effect of section 142 of the Companies 
						Act 1963, Act 179 which was relied upon by the 
						respondent. The section provides as follows: &quot;142 (1) A 
						person having dealings with a company or someone 
						deriving title under the company is entitled to assume; 
						(b) That a person described in the particulars filed 
						with the Registrar pursuant to sections 27 and 197 as a 
						director, managing director or secretary of the company 
						or represented by the company, acting through its 
						members in general meeting, board of directors, or 
						managing director, as an officer or agent of the 
						company, has been duly appointed and has authority to 
						exercise the powers and perform the functions 
						customarily exercised or performed by a director, 
						managing director or secretary of a company cat-tying on 
						business of the type carried on by the company or 
						customarily exercised or performed by an officer or 
						agent of the type concerned, and the company and those 
						deriving title under it are estopped from denying the 
						truth of that assumption&quot; Then section 142 (2) (a) 
						provides thus: &quot;For purposes of sub-section (1), a 
						person is not entitled to make any of those assumptions 
						if that person had actual knowledge to the contrary or 
						if having regard to the position with, or relationship 
						to the company, that person ought to have known the 
						contrary&quot; From the record of appeal respondent case was 
						that he did not owe the amount claimed by appellant 
						because he was made to pay same to appellant's Chief 
						Accountant, whom he regarded as a senior officer in 
						appellant's company. From respondent's evidence, he 
						claimed that when he was making the payments to the 
						Chief Accountant he knew the Chief Accountant had the 
						authority to receive payments oil of the appellant's 
						company. The appellant on the other hand challenged 
						respondent defence and claimed that it had put ill place 
						a procedure for the supply of goods to customers and 
						they were not required to make payment to the Chief 
						Accountant but rather to the Sales Manager. The 
						appellant submitted that since respondent knew of the 
						established sales procedure but went ahead and made 
						payments to the Chief Accountant, he could not avail 
						himself of section142 (b) of Companies Act. In the 
						circumstance of this case, however, the question one 
						need to answer is, can it be said that the respondent 
						had actual knowledge to the contrary that the Chief 
						Accountant could not receive payments on behalf of the 
						appellant company? I think the answer is No. The reason 
						is that from the record the respondent did not just walk 
						to the Chief Accountant and started making payments to 
						him in his house. Rather, it was the Chief Accountant 
						being the head of the Finance Department who requested 
						respondent to pay the cash and issue the cheques to him, 
						so that respondent's orders would be processed 
						expeditiously. How then could the respondent know that 
						the Chief Accountant had no authority to receive the 
						payment? Yes, the respondent was very much aware of the 
						sale procedures of the appellant's company but that per 
						se did not mean that he knew the Chief Accountant had no 
						authority to receive payments on behalf of the 
						appellant. It is on record that even though the monies 
						paid by respondent, were not credited to his account, he 
						received his supplies as ordered. That is to say 
						respondent received his supplies even though the Chief 
						Accountant was not paying monies received from 
						respondent to appellant's account. The continued supply 
						of goods to the respondent when payments were made to 
						the Chief Accountant naturally made it impossible for 
						the respondent to suspect or doubt the authority of the 
						Chief Accountant. The fact that respondent continued to 
						receive his supplies even though, unknown to him,his 
						payments were not credited to his account, shows that 
						the. sales procedure relied on by the appellant was not 
						so effective to bind a customer. Clearly from the 
						evidence, the Chief Accountant acted as the agent of 
						appellant and holding that senior management position, 
						the respondent would have no doubt at all about his 
						authority to receive the payment on behalf of appellant 
						since the Chief Accountant traditionally and 
						functionally was in charge of the finance of the 
						company. In discussing the effect and scope of section 
						142 of the Companies Act, Afreh JSC in the case of GODKA 
						GROUP OF COMPANIES VS. P S INTERNATIONAL LTD. 
						(2001-2002) SCGLR 918 had this to say at page 932: &quot;In 
						any case a person contracting with a company is not 
						required to demand the production of a resolution 
						authorizing the board, general meeting, an officer or 
						agent of the company, as the case may be to enter into 
						the contract. It has been established since the case of 
						the Royal British Bank v. Turquard (1843-60) All ER Rep 
						435 that a person dealing with a company is entitled to 
						assume in the absence of facts putting him on notice or 
						inquiry, that there has been due compliance with all 
						matters of internal management and procedure required by 
						the regulations of the company. This is the Rule in 
						Turquard's case or the Indoor Management Rule&quot; This rule 
						has been codified by our Companies Code 1963 (Act 179) 
						in section 139-143. Under section 142 (2) if the company 
						has held out someone as its agent, it is estopped from 
						denying the appointment, and it could be assumed that a 
						person de jure or de facto officer of the company has 
						the usual powers and duties of that sort of officer&quot; The 
						learned Judge of blessed memory continued on the same 
						page that: &quot;Section 142 (2) is also in accordance with 
						normal agency principles, where a person enters into a 
						contract with an officer or agent of a company, who has 
						apparent or ostensible authority of the company to enter 
						into the contract on its behalf, it will be estopped 
						from denying the authority of the officer or agent&quot; And 
						in Hely-Hutchinson V. Bray Head Ltd. (1968) 1 QB549 at 
						583, CA Lord Denning MR delivered himself thus: 
						&quot;Ostensible or apparent authority is the authority of an 
						agent as it appears to others.&quot; In this case I am of the 
						considered opinion that appellant's Chief Accountant 
						demonstrated ostensibly and apparently to the respondent 
						that he had the authority as the head of finance 
						department of appellant's company to receive the 
						payments from the respondent. Indeed the situation would 
						have been different if the respondent had paid the 
						monies to an officer who had nothing to do with the 
						finance department of the company; for example, making 
						payments to a Human Resource Officer of appellant's 
						company. Obviously, such an officer would have nothing 
						to doing with the financial management of the company 
						and as such a request from such officer naturally ought 
						to put one on notice. From the record of appeal no 
						credible evidence was adduced to prove that respondent 
						knew that the Chief Accountant had no authority to 
						receive payments for goods supplied to customers on 
						behalf of the appellant company. For this reason the 
						first ground of appeal will fail and it is dismissed. I 
						will now address original ground (iii) of the appeal 
						which is that the court erred when it failed to hold 
						that the respondent perpetuated fraud on the appellant 
						when he issued dud cheques for goods collected from the 
						appellant and in some cases connived with some officials 
						of the appellant to suppress the clearance of the 
						cheques. Evidence on record which is undisputed is that 
						appellant's Chief Accountant prevailed on the respondent 
						to pay cash and as well issue cheques to pay for the 
						same transaction. The respondent was told that paying 
						the cash and issuing the cheques will administratively 
						facilitate early supplies to him. The evidence is not 
						that respondent issued dud cheques in payment for the 
						goods supplied to him but that he paid cash and issued 
						cheques for the same supplies. Why would somebody who 
						wanted to defraud a company for goods supplied him, pay 
						cash and also issue cheques to cover the same supplies. 
						The appellant in its reply and defence to counterclaim 
						at paragraph 3 particularized the fraud as follows: 1. 
						Agreeing with the company through Sales Manager and 
						Directors to effect payment in cheques and by-passing 
						them to deal with the said Accountant. 2. Colluding with 
						the said Accountant with the intention of defrauding and 
						collecting goods not paid for. From the record the 
						appellant could not adduce credible evidence to 
						establish that the respondent had been fraudulent. The 
						evidence of appellant's representative Jean Adel Matter 
						as well as PW1, Nii Tackie Yarboi and Yaw Buabeng, PW2 
						could not establish any fraud against the respondent. 
						There is nothing oil by way of evidence to prove that 
						respondent's dealing with the Chief Accountant was 
						fraudulent as particularized, neither is there any 
						evidence of collision. It would have been different if 
						respondent collected goods and with the tacit consent of 
						the Chief Accountant issued cheques which respondent 
						knew would be dishonoured. The general principle of law 
						is that an allegation of fraud was to be established by 
						evidence called by the person alleging it. The evidence 
						led by the witnesses of the appellant at the trial 
						failed the test. in Strouds Judicial Dictionary (4th 
						ed), Vol 2 at 1095-95, Wills J., in Ex-parte Watson, 21 
						Q.B.D. 301 is quoted as follows:&quot;'Fraud' in my opinion, 
						is a term that should be reserved for something 
						dishonest and morally wrong, and much mischief is, I 
						think, done, as well as much pain inflicted, by its use 
						where 'illegality and 'illegal' are the really 
						appropriate expressions&quot; I do not think that in the 
						circumstance of this case the allegation of fraud 
						against the respondent was proved. The respondent rather 
						was prevailed upon by the appellant Chief Accountant to 
						pay cash and also issue cheques for goods supplied to 
						him. Indeed from the conduct of the Chief Accountant, 
						who at all material time relevant to this case was an 
						agent of the appellant, it can be concluded that 
						respondent and the appellant were rather victims of 
						fraud perpetuated by the Chief Accountant, who was an 
						agent of appellant. Ground (iii) has no merit and I 
						accordingly dismiss same. The next ground is that the 
						court failed to hold that the counterclaim of GH¢667.20 
						was part payment of goods collected from the appellant 
						but unpaid for was detected during the audit of the 
						respondent's accounts with the appellant. This is ground 
						(iv). From the record of appeal, this amount is what 
						respondent allegedly paid to the appellant when the 
						Managing Director asked respondent to continue business 
						with appellant but the amount was later seized on the 
						ground that respondent owed appellant. The respondent's 
						claim for this amount was pleaded at paragraph 23 of his 
						statement of defence, to which appellant replied at 
						paragraph 7 of its reply and defence to counterclaim. 
						&quot;23. The Defendant says that the Plaintiff's Managing 
						Director subsequently asked him to continue making 
						purchases from the Plaintiff and he continued to do this 
						until an amount of ¢6,772,000 he had with the Plaintiff 
						was seized by the Plaintiff on the pretext that he owed 
						the Plaintiff. Then appellant's paragraph 9 of the reply 
						and defence to counterclaim reads as follows:- &quot;9. In 
						reacting to paragraphs 23 to 28 of the statement of 
						defence and the counterclaim the Plaintiff deny them and 
						say that upon detection of the initial ¢46 million 
						against the Defendant and upon appeal from him, he was 
						advised by the plaintiff to make payments and receive 
						part supplies pending the outcome of the audit and the 
						outcome of all the credits and debits that has given 
						rise to this action............&#8221; From the above 
						averments the trial court found that indeed the 
						appellant seized the amount being claimed by the 
						respondent in his counterclaim. By appellant's pleading 
						at paragraph 9 of the reply and defence to counterclaim, 
						appellant admits that it advised the respondent to be 
						making payments after the audit, which exposed the Chief 
						Accountant. The admission clearly corroborated the 
						evidence of the respondent as averred at paragraph 23 of 
						his defence and counterclaim. The claim by the 
						respondent was therefore more probable of belief than 
						that of appellant, who alleged that the money was paid 
						to settle part of the amount taken by the Chief 
						Accountant. In fact from the record there is evidence 
						that respondent made the payments claimed per the 
						counterclaim, after the Chief Accountant had given an 
						undertaking to refund the monies he received from the 
						respondent. That being the case there was no reason for 
						the respondent to also start paying the debt, as 
						appellant wanted the court to believe. Clearly evidence 
						on record support the finding of the trial court that 
						the amount being claimed in the counterclaim was seized 
						from the respondent after appellant's Managing Director 
						had encouraged respondent to continue the business. This 
						ground also has no merit and fails. The last ground is 
						ground (ii) which is that the cost awarded was excessive 
						and unjustifiable. Award of cost generally is a 
						discretion exercise by the court. However Order 74 of 
						C.l 47 provides a guide for the award of cost in civil 
						proceedings in the High Court. Counsel for the appellant 
						has submitted that the cost of GH¢10,000.00 awarded the 
						respondent is not only excessive but unjustifiable. The 
						only reason for which the trial court awarded cost in 
						that quantum was that the case had been in court for 
						about fifteen years. The record of appeal does not show 
						that both counsel addressed the court before cost was 
						awarded as Order 74 R 2 (2) provides. In awarding the 
						cost of GH¢10,000.00 the trial court took into account 
						the number of years that parties had been in court 
						litigation the dispute. This was perfectly right under 
						Order 74 Rule (4) (c) which provides that the length and 
						complexity of the proceedings may be considered in 
						awarding cost. However this is only one of the stated 
						guidelines that the court had to consider in awarding 
						costs under Order 74. In this case hearing commenced on 
						the 18-11-96 and the case had to pass through the hands 
						of about four Judges before judgment was entered on the 
						31st of October, 2008, a period of twelve years. The 
						delay cannot be blamed on counsel for appellant alone as 
						counsel for respondent sought to urge on us in his 
						statement of case. Counsel for the respondent argued 
						that appellant counsel abandoned the cross examination 
						of respondent between 1998 till 2005. That fact 
						notwithstanding, in this case respondent had a 
						counterclaim so he could have prosecuted his 
						counterclaim without waiting for the appellant since the 
						counterclaim was a cross action. From the record the 
						delay cannot be blamed on the Appellant alone, hence I 
						think the trial court was wrong in awarding the cost of 
						GH¢10,000.00 against the appellant in the circumstance 
						making it seem that it was appellant that delayed the 
						case in court for about 15 years. The delay in the 
						proceedings was attributable to both parties and for 
						that reason I would review the cost so awarded. I think 
						in the circumstances cost assessed at GH¢5,000.00 for 
						the respondent against the appellant would be fair. 
						Accordingly, ground (ii) of the appeal succeeds and the 
						cost awarded by the lower court is set aside and in its 
						place cost of GH¢5,000.00 is awarded to the respondent. 
						But for the setting aside of the cost awarded by the 
						trial court, the entire appeal fails and same dismissed.
