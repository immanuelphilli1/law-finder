												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												TWUMASI, J.A.:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is an appeal from the 
												judgment of the Circuit Court; 
												Accra delivered on 14th January 
												1999. The appellant purchased a 
												piece of land from the chief of 
												Okponglo sometime in 1992. The 
												evidence showed that in exercise 
												of its executive powers the 
												Government of the Gold Coast (as 
												it then was) had already 
												compulsorily acquired large 
												tract of land engulfing this 
												parcel of land purchased by the 
												appellant. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Pursuant to the said acquisition 
												the Lands Commission granted the 
												respondent herein a lease of a 
												portion of the land for 
												residential purposes because it 
												turned out that the project for 
												which the government acquired 
												the land could not materialise. 
												However, in the supervening 
												period the Land Registry had 
												apparently due to oversight or 
												call it a mistake which that 
												institution in fact admitted at 
												the trial issued title 
												certificate to the appellant in 
												respect of the sale transaction 
												concluded between him and the 
												chief of Okponglo.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Lands Commission accordingly 
												applied to the Court for and was 
												granted an order for joinder 
												constituting it as co-defendant 
												in an action in which the 
												respondent sued the man to whom 
												the Land Commission granted the 
												lease. The Land Commission as 
												co-defendant counter-claimed for 
												an order directing the Chief 
												Registrar of Lands to rectify 
												the register by the cancellation 
												of the respondent&#8217;s title 
												certificate, declaration of 
												title and damages for trespass. 
												The respondent had by his 
												indorsement on the writ of 
												summons laid claim for (1) a 
												declaration of title, recovery 
												of possession, perpetual 
												injunction and ¢2 million 
												damages for trespass.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The learned trial judge made the 
												following explicit findings of 
												fact:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) That the land in dispute 
												fell within the acquisition 
												area.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) The alleged grant by the 
												chief of Okponglo to the 
												respondent was unlawful and 
												void.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(c) The title certificate issued 
												to the respondent by the Land 
												Title Registry was in error and 
												consequently void.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												He accordingly dismissed the 
												respondent&#8217;s action and entered 
												judgment for the defendant (the 
												lessee of the Lands Commission) 
												respondent herein, but denied 
												him the claim for damages for 
												trespass. On the 16th February, 
												1999 the respondent filed notice 
												of his intention to contend that 
												the decision of the court below 
												be varied by entering judgment 
												in his favour for damages and 
												costs for the relief which the 
												learned trial judge declined. 
												The appellant filed no less than 
												fourteen grounds of appeal but 
												only six of them were argued, 
												thus inferentially abandoning 
												those not canvassed before this 
												court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel began with additional 
												ground (1) impeaching the 
												alteration of Certificate of 
												Title No.404/44. Counsel 
												submitted that the learned trial 
												judge effected the amendment suo 
												motu but upon reading the record 
												of appeal I found abundant 
												evidence that a formal 
												application for the amendment 
												was made and arguments canvassed 
												before the trial judge, after he 
												had admirably considered the 
												authorities including the case 
												of Yeboah vrs Bofour (1971) 2 
												GLR.199 C.A. and Order 28 of 
												LN.140A and delivered a sound 
												ruling on the application. I 
												find no merit in additional 
												grounds (1) and (2). Ground 3 of 
												the grounds of appeal in essence 
												accused the trial Judge of suo 
												motu setting aside the 
												respondent&#8217;s certificate of 
												title to the disputed land on 
												grounds of mistake when, as 
												counsel put it, the respondent 
												and co-respondent had based 
												their case on fraud. In the 
												first place there was ample 
												evidence on record from which 
												allegation of mistake or 
												inadvertence could be inferred 
												from the conduct and omissions 
												of the Land Registry. With 
												regard to fraud, the appellant 
												undeniably made allegations of 
												fraud or dishonesty against the 
												respondent and accused him of 
												misconduct in the procurement of 
												land registration certificate 
												through lies and distorted facts 
												in certain correspondence. It 
												seems to me legitimate that the 
												learned trial judge dealt 
												adequately with fraudulent 
												registration.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the submission that the 
												respondent's title was 
												indefeasible and that the 
												learned trial judge erred in 
												declaring it void it is 
												sufficient to refer to section 
												122(1) of the Land Title 
												Registration Law 1985 
												(PNDCL.152). That section 
												provides that: &#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;122 (1) Subject to subsection 
												(2) of this section the court 
												may in its discretion, order the 
												rectification of the land 
												register by directing that any 
												registration be cancelled or 
												amended where it is satisfied 
												that such registration has been 
												obtained, made or committed by 
												fraud or mistake.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Subsection (2) is inapplicable 
												to this case and I need not 
												quote it. This ground of appeal 
												also fails. The next important 
												issue to deal with relates to 
												the location of the disputed 
												land. The learned trial judge 
												made explicit finding that the 
												land fell within the acquisition 
												area and this finding has been 
												assailed under ground (e). In my 
												considered opinion this finding 
												cannot be faulted because it was 
												supported by ample evidence 
												given by C.W.1 (Court witness 
												No.1) the surveyor and the 
												respondent&#8217;s own expert witness 
												P.W.2 who corroborated the 
												testimony of C.W.1. The law is 
												well-settled that where a 
												party&#8217;s own witness supports the 
												case of his opponent while his 
												own remains uncorroborated a 
												court of law must uphold the 
												corroborated evidence and enter 
												judgment on that basis: See 
												Tsirifo vrs: Duah VIII (1959) 
												GLR.63. The last ground of 
												appeal states that the learned 
												trial judge erred in holding 
												that the co-defendant was the 
												only authority to grant the land 
												in dispute when the co-defendant 
												failed to offer evidence that 
												the conditions set out in 
												article 18(4) and (5) of the 
												Constitution 1969 had been 
												fufilled.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The co-defendant Land Commission 
												is a Public Officer. The 
												presumption &#8220;Omnia preaesumuntur 
												rite esse acta&#8217; operates in 
												their favour and it presumed 
												until the contrary is proved 
												that public functions or duties 
												have been regularly performed: 
												See section 37 of the Evidence 
												Decree, 1975 (NRCD.323) and 
												Woollett vrs: Minister of 
												Agriculture and Fisheries (1955) 
												IQB.103 CA: (1954) 3 All ER.529. 
												There was therefore no need for 
												the co-defendant to offer 
												evidence to the effect that that 
												condition had been fulfilled by 
												it. In any event as counsel for 
												the respondent submitted and 
												rightly in my view, by virtue of 
												the compulsory acquisition of 
												the land the interest of the 
												state automatically superceded 
												all other interests: See S.12 of 
												the Public Lands Ordinance 
												(Cap.134). In the case of Mensah 
												Moncar vrs: Chieftaincy (1972) 2 
												GLR.293 the following headnote 
												appears: &#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) Where a notice of 
												acquisition property is 
												published in the Gazette, a 
												subject with interest in the 
												property has no right to convey 
												the title to the land to anyone 
												without the consent of the 
												government. Any purported 
												conveyance by vendor without the 
												said consent will be void 
												irrespective of the fact that 
												the conveyance is registered 
												with the Deeds Registry&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It appears quite clear that the 
												above decision by the High Court 
												is unassailable. It should in 
												law seal the doom of the 
												respondent&#8217;s case, particularly 
												all the arguments about the 
												registration of the respondent&#8217;s 
												title and the validity of the 
												conveyance itself by the chief 
												of Okponglo. This ground of 
												appeal also fails. The appeal is 
												hereby dismissed. However with 
												respect to damages claimed by 
												the respondent I find no good 
												grounds to disturb the trial 
												judge&#8217;s refusal. I therefore 
												refuse the application to vary 
												the judgment of the court below.</span></p>
