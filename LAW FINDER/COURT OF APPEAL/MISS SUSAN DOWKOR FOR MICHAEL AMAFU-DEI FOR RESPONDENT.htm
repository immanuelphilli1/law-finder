						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We dismissed this 
						appeal from the decision of Her Honour Miss A.M.A. 
						Dzordzie, as she then was sitting at the Accra Circuit 
						court and reserved our reasons.&nbsp; We now give them.&nbsp; The 
						facts giving rise to this action are simple and devoid 
						of any complex legal issues. Not unsurprisingly, the 
						evidence led on both sides is equally straightforward 
						and brief.&nbsp; It is therefore surprising that this appeal 
						is based not only on five main grounds but raises also 
						very many issues of law, some of which were never raised 
						at the trial.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The facts which led to 
						the commencement of these proceedings are that by a 
						letter dated 19th June, 1992, the respondent corporation 
						wrote to the appellant, terminating his appointment with 
						the respondent. The letter indicated the grounds upon 
						which the termination was based. It was alleged that, in 
						answering a query sent to him he had &#8220;used unacceptable 
						language in his replace to both the Regional Manager and 
						Head of Personnel. Such conduct it was pointed out was 
						&quot;in contravention of the laid down procedure and 
						regulations of the Trust&quot; But, because the sanction 
						imposed on him was a termination and not a summary 
						dismissal, the respondent paid him all his just 
						entitlements made up of his:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1)&nbsp; The balance of his 
						enhanced provident fund.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2)&nbsp; Balance on Savings 
						account,</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(3)&nbsp; A long service 
						award of ¢20.000.00</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(4)&nbsp; Three (3) months 
						Salary in lieu of notice. This of course was subject to 
						whatever moneys he owed the trust and or other 
						institutions, the Social Security Bank Ltd included.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Not in the least 
						satisfied with this turn of events, he sued the 
						respondents:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a)&nbsp; a declaration that 
						the termination was a nullity.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b)&nbsp; Reinstatement or 
						in the alternative damages for wrongful dismissal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">By the paragraph of his 
						statement of claim, he complains that the termination 
						was not only wrongful but incompetent and a complete 
						nullity. The following were set out as the particulars.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">First, that &quot;as an 
						officer Grade I the plaintiff cannot be terminated under 
						Article 1 Sub-Section 7(a) of the defendants rules of 
						service which does not apply to him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Secondly, that the 
						disciplinary Committee which investigated his conduct 
						was not properly constituted and was in contravention of 
						the laid-down procedure and regulations of the Trust in 
						so far as two junior members of staff were made to sit 
						on the committee and the termination letter was not 
						signed by the General Manager (Administration), the 
						officer authorised to do so under the regulations of the 
						Trust.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After a critical 
						examination of his claim and the evidence adduced on 
						both sides, the trial judge dismissed his claim.&nbsp; By 
						this appeal, he has invited us to set aside the decision 
						of the court below and award him such damages as we 
						think the circumstances justify.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Before we turn to the 
						substantive grounds it would be appropriate to deal with 
						the preliminary objection raised by the appellant 
						counsel in his reply. The objection is that since the 
						respondent filed his written reply well after three 
						weeks, the period limited under Court of Appeal Rules, 
						1997, C.I.19, rule 20 subrule 4 he must be deemed to 
						have</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">filed any answer and 
						consequently he must not be heard in these proceedings. 
						Again, it was urged this court has no discretion to 
						extend the time limited under the rules and therefore it 
						was urged that this defect was uncapable of cure.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We think that the 
						argument that this Court has no jurisdiction to extend 
						or enlarge the time within which a respondent may file a 
						written submission of his case in answer to the 
						appellants written submission is a complete fallacy. The 
						rules of court provides that the written answer (to 
						appellate submission) may be filed within three weeks of 
						the service&quot; or within such time as the court may upon 
						terms direct. We reproduce the rule. It stipulates.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(4) A party upon whom 
						an appellants written submission is served, shall, if he 
						wishes to contest the appeal, file the written 
						submission of his case in answer to the appellants 
						submission within three weeks of the service, or within 
						such time as the court may upon terms direct.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We think counsels 
						submission stems from a misapprehension of the subrule 
						8, which provides:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Where a respondent 
						does not file a written submission of his case and does 
						not agree to make a joint written submission under the 
						provisions of this rule he shall not be heard at the 
						hearing of the appeal except as to questions of costs.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The above rule is in 
						our humble opinion referable to a respondent who does 
						not take advantage of any of the steps or procedure 
						relating to the filling of a written answer namely that 
						in his own name he files a written answer or does agree 
						with the appellant to make a joint submission. In other 
						words, the rule that the respondent shall not be heard 
						save as to the question of costs may not properly be 
						invoked against a respondent who has at the time of the 
						hearing filed a written submission in answer, albeit out 
						of time. Clearly by the provisions of sub rule (4) the 
						offending party may succeed in having the time allowed 
						under the rules enlarged.&nbsp;&nbsp; The respondent in this, at 
						the case at the case at the date of the hearing had 
						filed a written submission and had at the hearing 
						applied to have the time enlarged for these purposes.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We now turn our 
						attention to the substantive grounds of appeal. By the 
						first ground, the appellant complains that the learned 
						trial judge erred in law in allowing the respondents to 
						amend their defence so as to allege for the first time 
						new facts, at a time they had opened the defence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The argument in the 
						main was that the grant of leave was an improper 
						exercise of a discretion for it allowed them to plead 
						and tender the Exhibit &#8216;2&#8217; the rules of service 
						governing senior employees, and this in effect allowed 
						them to set up for the first time, at that late stage a 
						claim that his termination was based on that document.&nbsp; 
						It was argued at the hearing that the Exhibit &quot;2&quot; is 
						fraudulent, an altogether pure fabrication calculated to 
						deceive the court. Also that it does not bear the common 
						seal of the Trust and further that it was never executed 
						or issued on the behalf of the Trust.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The clear position of 
						the law is that an appellate Court would only interfere 
						with and set aside an exercise of discretion by a trial 
						judge where the judge of first instance failed to act 
						judicially. What this means has been explained in 
						Ballmoos vrs: Mensah 1984-86 I GLR.725 as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The Court of Appeal 
						would not interfere with the exercise of the trial 
						courts discretion save in exceptional circumstances.&nbsp; An 
						appeal against the exercise of the courts discretion 
						might succeed on the ground that the discretion was 
						exercised on wrong or inadequate materials if it could 
						be shown that the court acted under a misapprehension of 
						fact in that it either gave weight to irrelevant or 
						unproved matters or omitted to take relevant matters 
						into court, but the appeal was not from the discretion 
						of the court to the discretion of the appellate 
						tribunal.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned justices in 
						Nkrumah vrs: Serwah &amp; Ors. 1984-86 1 GLR. 190 at 198 
						stated the circumstances under which an appellate court 
						would disturb the exercise of a trial courts discretion 
						to grant or disallow leave to amend as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The granting or 
						refusal of the application for leave to amend pleadings 
						is discretionary and the court of appeal will not 
						interfere with the exercise of that discretion unless it 
						is satisfied that the trial judge applied a wrong 
						principle or it can be said that he reached a wrong 
						conclusion which would work manifest injustice: See 
						Yeboah vrs: Barfuor 1971 2 GLR. 199 CA.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We have examined the 
						appellants affidavit in opposition to the motion for 
						leave to amend. No where in his affidavit does he raise 
						the rather serious issues of fact which he now seeks to 
						raise namely the issue that the Exhibit '2' is 
						fraudulent, an afterthought and a fabrication, 
						calculated to deceive the court and further that it does 
						not bear the common seal of the Trust and was never 
						executed on behalf of the Trust. &nbsp;Indeed even as regards 
						the case of the limited facts that were set up in the 
						affidavit in opposition, appellant plainly at the 
						hearing of the motion withdrew any opposition that he 
						may have to the grant of leave, and consented himself 
						with a praise to raise technical points at the address</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">stage.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As assign of his good 
						faith in agreeing to the amendment, he filed an amended 
						and reply amended summons for directions.&nbsp; He was 
						allowed (1) to recall the appellant, (2) to lead 
						evidence in rebuttal of the fresh or uncleared matters 
						that arose as a result of the amendment and the evidence 
						led in support thereof. There was no injustice to him, 
						neither was he taken by surprise nor has there been a 
						miscarriage of justice. Frankly, he cannot now (1) raise 
						these issues of fact and (2) accuse the learned trial 
						judge of having taken the wrong facts into consideration 
						in allowing the amendment. In any case the S.(9) SS (4) 
						of the Social Security Law, 1991 PNDCL.247, does not 
						require that the rules of service must, in order to be 
						valid, bear the seal of the Trust. Finally, and even 
						more importantly, the issues that are now being raised 
						in relation to the application for leave (ought in view 
						of the position taken by the appellant that he would not 
						to oppose the application), properly to have been taken 
						earlier at the tendering of the document itself, or 
						raised during the cross-examination of the witness or 
						witnesses who led evidence on the Exhibit &quot;2&quot; and its 
						import, and also when the need arose to lead evidence on 
						his own behalf in proof or disproof of the necessary 
						facts. In short then we find no merit in this ground of 
						appeal and an appeal based on same must fail.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Next, it was submitted 
						with respect to the ground 2 that in so far as the 
						Exhibit &quot;2&quot; was not stamped, authenticated or executed 
						it was inadmissible and the learned trial judge erred in 
						law in admitting same into evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">When the Exhibit was 
						sought to be tendered on the 9th of May 1995, the 
						appellate counsel raised no objection to its tender.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Nevertheless, we think 
						this ground of appeal is equally meritorious. First, it 
						has not been demonstrated that rules of service Exhibit 
						&quot;2&quot; is liable to stamp duty. The mere fact that it has 
						been described by at the cover as an indenture does not 
						make it a deed, liable to stamp duty.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It has also been argued 
						that since (1) the Exhibit '2' does not bear the seal of 
						the Trust and also (2) that has not proved to have been 
						signed or executed by the person purported to have made, 
						it is clearly inadmissible and any decision based on it 
						ought properly to be set aside.&nbsp; We think the second 
						issue raised ought to touch on the cogency or the weight 
						to be attached to the Exhibit &quot;2&quot; rather than its 
						admissibility, which in any case was never put in issue 
						at the trial.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As regards the issue of 
						the seal of the Trust, counsel has not demonstrated that 
						under S.9(1) of the Social Security Law 1991, PNDCL.247, 
						the rules of service is included in the class of 
						contracts etc. in respect of which the seal of the 
						/Trust is required.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We on our part do not 
						think the law requires that the seal of the Trust ought 
						to applied to the Exhibit '2'.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The objects of the 
						Trust, as set out under S.3 are as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) to be responsible 
						for the general administration of this law and any 
						regulation made thereunder;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b)&nbsp; to provide social 
						protection for the making population for various 
						contingencies such as old age, invalidity, and such 
						other contingencies as may be specified by law. </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c)&nbsp; to be responsible 
						for the administration and investructure of the Scheme 
						within the frame work of general directives issued by 
						the Board referred to in section 4 of this law. </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d) to carry out such 
						other activities as may appear to the Trust to be 
						incidental or conducive to the attainment of its objects 
						under this law.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We think that it is 
						contracts, deeds etc. which are entered into in 
						realisation of these objectives that must bear the 
						common seal. Finally, we think it is too late in the day 
						for the appellant counsel as he attempts to do now to 
						raise questions as to the authenticity or identity of 
						the Exhibit '2', all of which are issues of fact, or the 
						fact that it offends the primary evidence rule in that, 
						it is not an original or the duplicate or the fact that 
						no foundation was laid before it was tendered.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">These are all matters 
						which ought properly to have been raised at the time the 
						document was tendered. Even under cross examination no 
						questions were asked on any of these matters, namely, 
						authenticity or genuineness, identity, etc. We find no 
						merit in the ground as well and we would dismiss it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The ground '3&#8217; reads:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The learned Judge 
						misdirected herself in law in failing to hold that the 
						Defendants are estopped by the contents of Exhibit &#8216;C&#8217; 
						herein from claiming that the Terms &quot;rules of service is 
						used exclusively in the Trust with respect to Senior 
						Staff conditions of service.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It does not appear from 
						the above the ground and the reliance on the case of 
						Social Security Bank Ltd. vrs: Agyarkwa 1991, 2 GLR.192 
						C.A. that we are being invited to determine whether the 
						issue of estoppel by conduct does arise in this action. 
						For indeed had he intended to rely on estoppel (by 
						representation or otherwise) the law requires that he 
						raise it in his pleadings.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Since he raised no such 
						plea, it would clearly to be wrong for him to criticize 
						the learned trial judge for failing to deal with the 
						issue. But as we have already pointed out it does not 
						seem to us that is the argument being raised by the 
						ground &#8216;3&#8217;.&nbsp; If we understand him correctly his 
						discontent lies with the trial judge&#8217;s failure to opt 
						for their version and hold in their favour as they had 
						maintained in their pleadings para, 4 (1) and their 
						evidence, that being a Senior Officer Grade I the 
						Article I subsection 7(a) of the defendants rules of 
						service which they have referred to in their dismissal 
						letter Exhibit &#8216;A' does not apply to him. Put in order 
						words, the argument of appellant counsel is that since 
						the respondents</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">by their own exhibit 
						'A' has asserted that the appellants dismissal is based 
						on Article 1 ss.7(d) of the rules of service, and 
						reference also is made to rules of service in his 
						appointment to a junior officer grade in Exhibit 'G', 
						the respondents ought not to be heard, and must be 
						estopped from asserting that &quot;the rules of service&quot; 
						referred to in the Exhibit 'A', the termination letter 
						is not the same as that which is referred to in Exhibit 
						&#8216;C&#8217; and which rules cover only junior officers.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Consequently, it was 
						urged that the learned trial judge ought not to have 
						found in respondent&#8217;s favour that the termination was 
						effected under the Exhibit &#8216;2&#8217;. What we are being 
						invited to do therefore is to reverse the finding and 
						hold firstly that the termination was effected under the 
						collective agreement Exhibit &#8216;F&#8217; and secondly that it 
						was a nullity.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We are afraid however 
						that we cannot acede to this request.&nbsp; The learned trial 
						judge rightly in our view recognised the importance of 
						determining which contract of employment governed the 
						relationship between the parties at the date of the 
						termination of the employment.&nbsp; She concluded and 
						rightly so in our view, that it was the Exhibit &#8216;2&#8217; 
						emphasising further that the contention that it was 
						based on the Exhibit &#8216;F&#8217; is baseless.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This finding cannot be 
						faulted.&nbsp; First while the Exhibit &#8216;A&#8217; identified the 
						article under which the termination was effected as 
						Article 1 subsection 7(d) of the Rule of Service, the 
						Exhibit &#8216;2&#8217; is nevertheless described on the cover as 
						&#8220;Rules of Service and conditions of the Senior Staff of 
						the SSNIT.&nbsp; Thus, even if when he was appointed as a 
						Junior Officer the contract that was to govern their 
						relationship was also whether rightly or wrongly 
						described in the Exhibit &#8216;G&#8217; as rules of service, the 
						plain truth is that it was rules of service that 
						governed junior, not senior officers.&nbsp; To contend that 
						it is the same rules of service tendered at the hearing 
						as Exhibit &#8216;F&#8217; that governed the relationship between 
						him and his employers, even in his position as a senior 
						officer is preposterous.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Indeed his own 
						confession that in 1981 he ceased to be governed by the 
						collective agreement and that he became a member of the 
						Senior Staff Association belies his contention.&nbsp; Since 
						at the trial the unchallenged testimony shows that the 
						senior officers are governed by the rules of service and 
						not the collective agreement, this ground of appeal 
						clearly fail.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Again, we find no merit 
						in the ground 4(1).&nbsp; It was submitted with respect to 
						this ground that the learned trial judges determination 
						of an issue which was never raised at the trial and was 
						not even germaine to the matters in dispute, is not 
						supported by the record.&nbsp; It was however&nbsp; urged upon us 
						that since by that determination she was in offence of 
						the plain rule in Dam vrs: Addo 1962 2 GLR.200 at 204 &#8211; 
						206, namely that a court must not proprio mutuo 
						substitute its own case for a party, we are bound not 
						only to reverse the finding but reverse the entire 
						decision.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">But, again we find the 
						criticism of the learned trial judge most unjustified.&nbsp; 
						A cursory reading of her judgment shows that her 
						reference to S.20 of article 14 (the alleged finding 
						complained of) was not meant to be a substitution of the 
						case set up by the respondents &#8212; namely that the 
						termination was effected under Article 1 sub(d).&nbsp; Indeed 
						no where in her judgment did she think that the 
						termination falls or was effected under that rule.&nbsp; Her 
						reference to the said article was merely (1) to point 
						out what terminal benefits the appellant was entitled to 
						on the termination of his employment and (2) to 
						demonstrate as indeed the evidence on the record 
						justified that, he indeed recovered all his just 
						entitlements as pertains under the Article 20 sub.20.&nbsp; 
						Indeed it was this finding that, namely what benefits 
						accrued to him under a lawful termination that as 
						although as appellant counsel has rightly pointed out 
						was not in issue, that made her conclude finally that 
						indeed the whole exercise was lawful; based on the 
						simple reason that appellant was never denied any of his 
						just benefits.&nbsp; The appeal based on this ground fails.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The next ground of 
						appeal raises the question of whether or not the judge 
						finding that junior members of staff may participate in 
						disciplinary proceedings involving a Senior member of 
						staff is borne out by the evidence on the record. </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In his evidence in 
						chief given on the 16th of May, 1994, the appellant 
						disclosed as his reasons for challenging the legality of 
						the two junior persons presence on the committee the 
						fact that it was &#8220;morally improper&#8221;.&nbsp; Furthermore he 
						attributed his failure to raise objection to their 
						inclusion to his ignorance that they were junior staff.&nbsp; 
						When another opportunity arose even under 
						cross-examination for him to explain what he meant by 
						the charge that the committee was improperly 
						constituted, he could not specify which rule of law or 
						procedure has by the inclusion of these two gentlemen 
						been violated.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">When questioned on the 
						issue his answer was:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;I am not aware of the 
						capacity in which Onuma and Eshun sat on the committee 
						but I feel they are not qualified to sit on a committee 
						investigating a matter involving two senior staff 
						(emphasis ours:)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As against this 
						evidence based purely on morality and personal feelings 
						we have evidence from the respondents that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The committee was 
						appointed by the management and (2) further that these 
						two sat on the committee not in their personal 
						capacities as junior officers but as lawfully appointed 
						(by their own) representatives of the two departments 
						they work in and which departments are legally entitled 
						to serve on the disciplinary committee&#8212;namely the public 
						relations department and the CDR. The witnesses had in 
						early procedures showed in his evidence in chief that 
						their disciplinary committee system is based on 
						management representatives and representatives of 
						identifiable bodies, the respondent reaffirmed their 
						position (in their answer to a question posed by the 
						court.) I reproduce same.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Do I understand you to 
						mean that the membership is permanently represented by 
						departments and as and when a case arises a department 
						select who should represent that particular depart.&quot; 
						(SIC)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A. Yes, and sometimes 
						within a year the members are the same, but where a case 
						arises and a member representing that particular 
						department has travelled or is not around the head of 
						department can nominate any other body to represent the 
						department&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the action before 
						the learned trial judge the burden of establishing that 
						the inclusion of the two men was in contravention of the 
						laid down procedures and regulations of the trust lay on 
						the party alleging same, the appellants. Having failed 
						to specify which rule have been breached, having closen 
						rather to rely on morality and emotions and so having 
						clearly failed to discharge the evidential burden that 
						lay on him it is totally wrong to castigate the learned 
						trial for opting for the respondents version on these 
						essential matters.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Surely with his total 
						failure to lead any scintilla of evidence on his 
						allegation.&nbsp; It is reprehensible for him to demand that 
						the respondent who did not bear the initial were bound 
						to call further witnesses to substantiate the evidence 
						of the D.W. 1 that the junior officers were lawfully 
						appointed by their members to represent them on the 
						committee.&nbsp; We find no merit in this ground of appeal 
						and dismiss same accordingly.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Ground 4(3) states:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;There is no evidence 
						to support the finding of the learned judge that the 
						Personnel Manager was mandated to sign the Exhibit &#8216;A&#8217; 
						(the letter of termination).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellants 
						complaint, as can be seen from his pleadings and his 
						evidence in chief and under cross-examination is that 
						Mr. Glymin who signed the Exhibit &#8216;A&#8217; has no power to 
						dismiss him and consequently has no power to sign the 
						Exhibit &#8216;A&#8217;.&nbsp; The trial judge investigated this 
						complaint and quite rightly in our view came to the 
						conclusion that the termination was done by the body 
						authorised to do so and Glymin merely signed under 
						mandate, but not in his position as the authority 
						terminating the employment.&nbsp; We are in complete 
						agreement with this finding. The evidence of the 
						signatory, Mr. Glymin who is the head of Administration 
						is on the record.&nbsp; We have no reason to disbelieve his 
						assertion.&nbsp; The letter Exhibit &#8216;A&#8217; clearly shows, he was 
						not even doing the termination, but that it was 
						management who was ordering it.&nbsp; The case of Blay-Markeh 
						vrs: Ghana Airways Corporation 1972 2 GLR. 254 relied on 
						by appellant counsel does not help the appellants 
						cause.&nbsp; If anything it rather destroys his case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this case 
						Blay-Merkeh sued the corporation because, as unlike the 
						situation in this present case his dismissal was not 
						sanctioned by the body authorised to dismiss him which 
						at the time was the board.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this action, where 
						the appellants allegation is that his appointment has 
						been unlawfully terminated, as was found by the trial 
						judge, we are satisfied that the action was carried out 
						by the body &#8212; authorised to do so, the management.&nbsp; The 
						administrative manager merely conveyed the decision of 
						management to the appellant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In any case, the issue 
						raised now by this ground of appeal does not seem to be 
						the grievance raised by the appellant in his writ.&nbsp; I 
						reproduce the relief I sought.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;the said termination 
						letter was not signed by the General Manager 
						(Administration) in consonance with the laid down 
						procedures and regulations of the Trust.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Be that as it may, we 
						find no merit in this ground as we think there was ample 
						evidence to justify the finding.&nbsp; The last ground of 
						appeal contains the omnibus ground that the judgment is 
						against the weight of evidence.&nbsp; However all the matters 
						raised therein, the constitution of the committee, 
						whether the article 1 subsection 7(d) of Exhibit &#8216;2&#8217; 
						applies to the appellant, whether the termination was 
						wrongful, incompetent and a nullity etc. are all matters 
						we have extensively dealt within the other grounds of 
						appeal.&nbsp; We have found all the findings of fact 
						supported by the evidence on the record.&nbsp; We have found 
						the termination was lawful, it being in accord with the 
						rules and Regulations of the Trust.&nbsp; We think the 
						learned trial judge &#8211; decision is sound both in law and 
						fact.&nbsp; It follows this appeal fails and the same is 
						accordingly dismissed.</span></p>
