						The application which triggered the preliminary 
						objection, which is the issue before this court is 
						entitled. MOTION ON NOTICE FOR EXTENSION OF TIME WITHIN 
						WHICH TO APPLY FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL The motion paper 
						showed that, applicant is praying for an order for 
						extension of time to apply for leave to appeal. The 
						reason assigned in support is that the appeal stands a 
						good chance of success.AND EXHIBIT 'AD1', attached, 
						showed that diligent efforts were made to secure a copy 
						of the RULING given on 6' August 2009, and that 
						applicant was not negligent. At the hearing counsel for 
						the Republic/Respondent argued that 
						appellant/applicant's right of appeal had not accrued. 
						He referred to section 90 of the Armed Forces Act, 
						Regulation 4 of the Armed Forces [Court Martial Appeal 
						Court] Regulations and Regulations 4(1) of the Rules of 
						Court (Court Martial Appeal Court). Counsel submitted 
						that the combined effect of the rules is that an 
						applicant/appellant has (90) ninety days as the 
						prescribed period to apply to the officer commanding his 
						unit/establishment. Regulation 4(1) of the Rules of 
						court (Court Martial Appeal's Court) provides: &quot;The 
						period within which a person convicted by a court, other 
						than a person sentenced to death must, as a condition 
						precedent to the exercise of his right of appeal, 
						present under regulation 4(a) of these rules to the 
						appropriate authority a petition praying that his 
						conviction be quashed shall be 90 days next following 
						that on which the finding of the Court- Martial was 
						promulgated&quot;. And section 90(a) of the Armed Forces 
						Regulations provides: &quot;Every person who has been tried 
						and found guilty by a court Martial shall have a right 
						of appeal to the Court Martial Appeal Court, in such 
						form, manner and within..... &quot;...such time as may be 
						prescribed in terms of either or both of the following 
						a. the legality of any or all findings. The two 
						legislations reproduced above showed that the law giver 
						contemplates a PERSON CONVICTED AND, EVERY PERSON WHO 
						HAS BEEN TRIED AND FOUND GUILTY by a Court Martial&quot;. 
						Even though applicant has been convicted after a full 
						trial his application for LEAVE to appeal relates to the 
						interlocutory order/finding that, he should enter his 
						defence, because a prima fade case has been made against 
						him. Under section 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 
						Act 30/60 (as amended) a prima facie case per se cannot 
						lead to a conviction. The meaning of, PRIMA FACIE would 
						provide a proper context in which to look at the issues 
						raised by this application and the preliminary 
						objection. Prima facie evidence means: &quot;that which, not 
						being inconsistent with the falsity of the hypothesis... 
						&quot;...nevertheless raises such degree of probability in 
						its favour that it must prevail if believed by the jury 
						unless rebutted or the contrary proved&quot;. Another 
						definition of what constitutes prima fade case is as 
						seen in the case: SHER SINGH VRS JITENDRAHATH SEN [1931] 
						1 LR calc. 275 there Ghose J stated: &quot;It (prima facie) 
						means that there is ground for proceeding but prima fade 
						case is not the same thing as 'PROOF' which comes later 
						when the court has to find whether the accused is guilty 
						or not guilty; 'PROOF' is nothing but belief according 
						to the conditions laid down in the Evidence Act&quot;. Even 
						though applicant has been convicted after a full trial 
						he chose to attack the order/ruling of prima facie 
						finding made against him, that he has a case to answer. 
						There are a number of schools of thought on this type of 
						application that has been made. The import of the 
						application is that his submission of no case to answer 
						was wrongly over-ruled. Hence the need for leave to 
						appeal against it. Counsel for applicant and the 
						respondent have not cited the exact rule of procedure in 
						support of their arguments. The analogous reasoning 
						adopted by counsel for respondent, wherein, he argued 
						that the procedure for conviction after a full trial is 
						applicable, is wrong. The submission made in that regard 
						showed the difficulty he faced is stating clearly what 
						the applicable rule of procedure really is. It is noted 
						even with the criminal procedure Code, Act 30/60, there 
						is a great difficulty in stating the law when a 
						judge/court has wrongfully over-ruled a submission of no 
						case to answer.I agree with the views expressed by MR 
						E.A. OSEW in his article in the REVIEW OF GHANA LAW, on 
						the topic, NO CASE TO ANSWER, at page 90 and 100. Whilst 
						analyzing the case R.V. OSABUE MAASEYO [1957] 3 WALR 
						180. C.A, he stated the court of appeal made a 
						distinction between the situation where there is some 
						evidence which could go to the jury, and the situation 
						where there is no evidence at that stage to go to the 
						jury.He further stated that in the former position if 
						there is subsequent conviction, the appellate court is 
						entitled to look at all the evidence in the case, 
						including evidence subsequently admitted after the 
						wrongful rejection of the submission of no case. And in 
						the other case [ie the latter] where there is no 
						evidence that could have gone to the jury at the time 
						the submission was made, the wrongful rejection of the 
						submission amount to a wrongful decision on a point of 
						law.That being so, the evidence adduced subsequently 
						should not be accepted as part of &quot;all the evidence in 
						the case&quot;. And the appellate court must therefore be 
						effectively precluded from considering it. As seen from 
						the title of the motion as quoted above, counsel for 
						applicant is seeking an extension of time as well as 
						LEAVE. Under the Courts Act, Act 459/93 as amended and 
						the regulations of this court there is NO RIGHT of 
						appeal from an interlocutory rulings/orders and 
						findings. It stands to reason that leave must be sought, 
						but no useful purpose would be served in granting either 
						the leave or extension of time for the applicant to 
						appeal against the interlocutory order.I am of the view 
						that the appropriate thing to do is to file a petition 
						as provided by the regulations of this court, and appeal 
						against the conviction entered against him after the 
						full trial. In that application or petition of appeal, 
						it would be appropriate to state as a ground of appeal, 
						the position that applicant has taken, namely that his 
						submission of no case to answer was wrongfully 
						over-ruled. BY COURT: The preliminary objection is 
						upheld, the application for extension for time within 
						which to apply for leave to appeal is dismissed. COUNSEL
