						QUAYE, J.A:- The appellant herein was convicted on his 
						own plea of guilty to three counts of offence that arose 
						under Section 54(1) of the Armed Forces Act 1962 (Act 
						105) on the 16th March 2009. The charges preferred 
						against him were: (1) Count One: An act to the prejudice 
						of good order and discipline which was based on 
						allegation that he, on 13th July 2008 married a female 
						other Rank, 194440 ABI Dosu Theresa at the Word Miracle 
						Church International, Abelemkpe. (2) In Count Two the 
						charge was &quot;neglect to the prejudice of good order and 
						discipline&quot;, and it was founded on the allegation that 
						the appellant neglected to ensure that 194440 AB 1 Dosu 
						Theresa obtained the requisite prior approval for her 
						release from the Ghana Armed Forces as required by CSIP 
						Vo13, Section 1, Article 1, 179 before getting married 
						to him, a commissioned officer. (3) The offence in the 
						third count was similar to that of Count One with 
						particulars that he aided the lady aforesaid to marry 
						him without the said lady obtaining prior approval for 
						her release from the Ghana Armed Forces contrary to CSIP 
						Vol. 3. Section 1 Article 1.179 a(2)(d). The General 
						Court Martial held its first sitting on 2nd March 2009 
						with Capt (GN) S.A. Aboagye (GH/1876) as president of 
						the panel; His Lordship Mr. Justice Anthony Oppong as 
						Judge Advocate and Mr. Pongo Eric as counsel for the 
						appellant. The court was held at the Naval Trade 
						Training School Cinema Hall Sekondi. The events on said 
						first sitting day are worth noting. They were not very 
						different however from normal procedure in criminal 
						trials. On that day, the charge sheet was amended. The 
						charges as amended, were read. The accused person (now 
						appellant) entered his plea of not guilty to all the 
						three counts; after this the Judge Advocate inquired 
						whether the defence would want an adjournment in order 
						to have sufficient opportunity for preparing the defence. 
						This inquiry attracted a response from Mr. Pongo of 
						counsel for the appellant, that he had no problem taking 
						the evidence of witnesses whose names appeared on the 
						record. With this assurance from the defence, the 
						Prosecutor was called upon and he submitted a written 
						address which he also summarized viva voce. This address 
						was tendered into evidence in whole and without any 
						objection from learned counsel for the appellant. The 
						introductory remarks of the prosecutor wherein he sought 
						to place before the court what the prosecution intended 
						to prove were very instructive. He stated: &quot;...The 
						accused person who is a commissioned officer married a 
						female rating otherwise referred to as other Rank (or a 
						soldier) known as 194440 AB 1 Dosu Theresa of 37 
						Military Hospital on 13th July 2008. On 1st September 
						2008, the said AB1 Dosu applied to resign voluntarily 
						from the Armed Forces. Obviously, the marriage between 
						the accused person and the rating was contracted before 
						the application for her release from the service. The 
						application and its approval should have preceded the 
						marriage in accordance with command and staff 
						Instructions Procedures (CSIP) of the Armed Forces. Mere 
						submission of the application to resign is not enough to 
						bestow upon a female other Rank (OR) the capacity to 
						marry an officer. Approval for her release must 
						necessarily be granted before she can be clothed 
						with-the capacity to marry the accused person. The 
						reasons for the provision that a female soldier should 
						resign from the service before marrying an officer 
						cannot be far-fetched especially in an institution whose 
						very existence depends largely on good order and 
						discipline. &quot;...The investigation revealed that the 
						accused person did marry the female other Rank on 13th 
						July 2008 in a blatant violation of military regulations 
						governing marriage in the Armed Forces...&quot;. With this 
						introduction over, the prosecutor proceeded to identify 
						and explain the material aspects of what they intended 
						to prove in respect of each count. In count one inter 
						alia, the prosecution intended to prove that there was 
						such marriage; that the marriage was contracted at a 
						time when the parties to the marriage were both in the 
						employment of the Ghana Armed Forces; and that the 
						marriage so contracted was a social misconduct which is 
						prejudicial to good order and discipline in the Armed 
						Forces. In count two, the prosecution was to prove that 
						the appellant negligently failed to ensure that AB1 Dosu 
						Theresa obtained the requisite prior approval of her 
						release from the Armed Forces, and further, that this 
						failure on the part of the appellant was a conduct 
						prejudicial to good order and discipline under military 
						regulations. In count three the prosecution intended to 
						prove that by his conduct, the appellant assisted the 
						lady other Rank to marry him, the said assistance was 
						offered in clear violation of military regulations, and 
						that that Conduct offended the provision in section 
						54(1) of Act 105. In conclusion the prosecutor said that 
						the Ghana Armed Forces just like any Other security 
						institution thrives on good order and discipline. The 
						appellant's conduct amounts to indiscipline and a 
						disregard for orderliness. Two witnesses were they 
						called to testify for the prosecution. Both Pw1 and Pw2 
						by their evidence established that the appellant and the 
						lady named were joined in Holy Matrimony at the Word 
						Miracle Church at Dzorwulu, Accra on 13th July 2008, Pw1 
						however denied that in the course of their training any 
						mention was made of how one could marry in the Armed 
						Forces. Pw2 was the Naval Officer who took the summary 
						of Evidence in this case. The summary was tendered into 
						evidence as Exhibit F. Pw2 confirmed under cross 
						examination that the issue of marriage was a subject 
						matter in the , curriculum of training in the Forces, 
						more especially in the Fundamental . Officer Training, 
						adding further, that the marriage between the appellant 
						and the other Rank female constituted an act of 
						indiscipline. I will now quickly turn to Exhibit F which 
						also formed part of the case for the prosecution. The 
						witnesses from whom evidence was taken confirmed : the 
						marriage as a fact. One of the officers Capt (GH) K.P. 
						Faidoo (GH/1970) .gave a vivid statement; part of which 
						read &quot;since this bordered on discipline, and smacked of 
						the type of officer-rating relationship which the CNS 
						has been ,warning about all the time, and since such 
						matters were in my domain as the D.N.A, I inquired 
						further.... I therefore asked for the number of the 
						commanding officer of the officer and Called him. He 
						informed me that the officer had been given casual leave 
						to come to Accra in connection with some attack on his 
						wife. This immediately struck me as odd since I was 
						unaware that the officer had put in a request to 
						marry.... He could not give any tangible reason why he 
						had gone ahead and married a rating in spite of all the 
						warnings from both the CNS and myself to all officers at 
						various fora...&quot; The last reference I will make from 
						Exhibit F is a short excerpt from the statement of the 
						appellant himself. Hear him &quot;I know I made a regrettable 
						mistake for not waiting for the final approval of the 
						release of my wife&quot;. The evidence of Pw1 and Pw2 
						together with the exhibits tendered on that day, ended 
						the proceedings on the first sitting and also the case 
						for the prosecution. On the second day new developments 
						were announced to the court from the defence which 
						abruptly terminated the trial. The learned counsel for 
						the appellant, Mr. Pongo, informed the court that, 
						&quot;having carefully considered the charge and my 
						instructions, I have advised that the accused must 
						change his plea&quot;. In consequence, the necessary 
						formalities, like reading the charges afresh were 
						undertaken, whereupon the appellant changed his earlier 
						pleas of not guilty to those of guilty to all three 
						counts. In accordance with procedural requirements the 
						Judge Advocate sought confirmation from the appellant if 
						he indeed appreciated the situation, and the appellant 
						duly replied in the affirmative leading to his 
						conviction on all the three counts. Before sentence was 
						pronounced, the prosecutor again made a statement to 
						call attention to the seriousness of the offence. He 
						stated that: &quot;This marriage was contracted against the 
						background that command has on several occasions 
						exhorted against marriage between officers and ratings 
						as these kinds of marriage are prejudicial to good order 
						and discipline to the Armed Forces. It is by virtue of 
						this that the CSIP (Command Staff and Instructions and 
						Procedures) was promulgated to impose obligation on 
						ratings or soldiers who intend marrying officers to 
						resign before they do so.The reasons behind the CSIP 
						cannot be overemphasized especially when one considered 
						that the very survival of such an institution depends on 
						discipline and good order. The Ghana Armed Forces deems 
						the marriage between the accused and AB 1 Dosu as such 
						act that is prejudicial to good order and discipline. It 
						is against this background that the accused was charged 
						under section 54(1) of the Armed Forces Act, 1962 (Act 
						105)...&quot; At the end of the prosecutor's address learned 
						counsel for the appellant, Mr. Pongo said, &quot; My client 
						has been charged under section 54(1) of the Armed Forces 
						Act. The sentence attached to the offence is either 
						dismissal or a lesser punishment. Having pleaded guilty, 
						we plead for mitigation of sentence...&quot;. It is needless 
						to say that the court passed a sentence of dismissal. 
						from. the Armed Forces in terms of section 78(i)(e) of 
						Act 105. The above, admittedly long preamble, forms the 
						basis of this appeal on the grounds that: (a) The 
						punishment imposed on the appellant was. too harsh 
						considering the offence committed. (b) The conviction 
						and sentence of the accused was wrong in law since there 
						was no obligation on the accused to perform under any 
						regulation of the Armed Forces. (c) The law under which 
						the appellant was dismissed is discriminatory and 
						therefore Contrary to the fundamental human rights of 
						the couple as enshrined in the 1992 constitution of 
						Ghana. Learned counsel for the appellant argued the 1st 
						and 2nd grounds of appeal together. He contended that 
						the punishment provided under the Armed Forces 
						Regulations include but not limited to reprimand, 
						forfeiture of pay, loss of seniority and reduction in 
						rank. He argued that the punishment imposed by the trial 
						court being dismissal with disgrace for just marrying a 
						female other rank amounts to a travesty of justice since 
						the marriage per se did not occasion any act of 
						indiscipline. He submitted that the appellant was of 
						good record, besides, there is no law in Ghana which 
						prohibits any official of the Armed Forces from marrying 
						a female other Rank. In a supplementary address, learned 
						counsel made reference to the evidence of Pw2 and 
						submitted that the statement that officers were 
						instructed not to marry from other rank was not proved 
						in evidence and therefore cannot be relied upon. In 
						respect of his third ground of appeal, learned counsel 
						expressed the view that the law which bars marriages 
						between commissioned officers and other ranks is a 
						colonial legacy, discriminatory, in conflict with the 
						constitution of Ghana 1992 and should be expunged. On 
						their part the respondents have raised a preliminary 
						legal issue contending that in so far as the appellant 
						set down only one ground of appeal in his application 
						for leave to appeal without indicating that he was 
						likely to file additional grounds later, the appellant 
						was estopped in law from amending his application for 
						leave to appeal and filing new grounds of appeal, albeit 
						with leave of this court. The format that I intend to 
						follow is to address this preliminary. Legal issue 
						first, after which I will, sua sponte, consider the 
						propriety in law of this appeal before I finally tackle 
						the grounds of appeal. I have read both the Armed Forces 
						Act 105 being the substantive legislation as well as the 
						Armed Forces (Court Martial Appeal Court) Regulations 
						1969 (LI 622) and I have come to the conclusion that 
						neither the parent Act nor the subsidiary Regulations 
						give any inkling as to whether or when a notice or 
						application for leave to appeal, can or could, be 
						amended. In fact there is no mention at all as to 
						whether that right exists and can be exercised. Reading 
						section 90 of Act 105 however satisfies me somewhat, 
						that an appellant can base his appeal on. (a)The 
						legality of any or all findings ; and (b)The legality of 
						the whole or any part of the sentence. The above 
						provision is not, to my mind, exclusive or intended to 
						foreclose the filing of any additional ground once an 
						application had been filed and granted. other rank was 
						not proved in evidence and therefore cannot be relied 
						upon. In respect of his third ground of appeal, learned

						of LI 622 talks about leave to appeal &quot; being an 
						application in the prescribed form and specifying the 
						grounds on which leave to appeal is sought...&quot; If I am 
						not mistaken, this is the only provision in LI 622 where 
						an allusion has been made to &quot;ground of appeal&quot;. We may 
						borrow a leaf from the Court of Appeal Rules 1997 (Cl. 
						19) even though that Instrument is specifically for 
						application in the Court of Appeal. Rule 8(2) thereof 
						states: &quot;8(2)The notice of appeal shall be filed in the 
						Registry of the court below and shall (a) set out the 
						grounds of appeal. &quot;8(7) The appellant shall not, 
						without the leave of the court, urge or be heard in 
						support of any ground of objection not mentioned in the 
						notice of appeal, but the court may allow the appellant 
						to amend the grounds of appeal upon such terms as the 
						Court may think just. &quot;8(8) Notwithstanding subrules (4) 
						to (7) of this rule, the Court in deciding the appeal 
						shall not be confined to the grounds set out by the 
						appellant but the court shall not rest its decision on 
						any ground not set out by the appellant unless the 
						respondent has had sufficient opportunity of contesting 
						the case on that ground&quot;. With the greatest respect to 
						learned counsel for the respondent, I would say that 
						even in the Court of Appeal Rules CI. 19. I do not find 
						any reference made to the phrase &quot; additional grounds to 
						be filed later&quot;. I believe that phrase appears or occurs 
						more in the form of practice than any specific rule. The 
						important thing is that since the courts exist for 
						administering justice, all parties may, within the 
						rules, be admitted to place before the court all 
						relevant or material issues that would help the court do 
						justice. One essential matter that the law would frown 
						upon is where there is an element of surprise, and this 
						would occur where the respondent was not at all made 
						aware of the matter being urged by the appellant. Where 
						the respondent had sufficient notice or opportunity of 
						contesting the case on that ground therefore; the ground 
						added would not be struck-out. In this case the 
						appellant applied for leave to file additional issues, 
						which application the respondent did not oppose. The 
						preliminary ground is therefore dismissed. In this case, 
						the appellant in the trial court changed his plea from 
						not guilty to guilty after the trial had proceeded to a 
						certain stage. In the ordinary sense, the counts would 
						not entertain an appeal against conviction on a plea of. 
						guilty. Indeed section 34 (2) of The Courts Act 1993 
						(Act 459) specifically states that (2) Without prejudice 
						to the generality of subSection (1) of this section an 
						appeal against conviction in a criminal case may be 
						dismissed summarily: under that subsection where the 
						appellant has pleaded guilty and has been convicted on 
						his own plea&quot; In the case of ALPHA ZABRAMA VRS THE 
						REPUBLIC (1976) 1GLR 291 at 302, 303, Taylor J (as he 
						then was) found a leeway on technical grounds and after 
						entertaining the appeal, laid down ingredients for the 
						guidance of the courts. The seven situations he 
						enumerated were: 1. If it can be shown that .an 
						appellant did not appreciate or understand the charge or 
						procedure and thus pleaded guilty by mistake. 2. If it 
						can be shown that the appellant has pleaded guilty to a 
						non-existent crime. 3. If the plea, of guilty is so 
						ambiguous that the appellant cannot be said to have 
						unequivocally pleaded guilty. 4. If the appellant 
						pleaded guilty but gave an explanation which practically 
						amounted to a defence or negatived the plea of guilty. 
						5. If the plea of guilty is such as in fact to be no 
						plea at all. 6. If on the admitted facts upon which the 
						prosecution is founded, no offence is disclosed upon 
						which the appellant could legally be convicted on the 
						charge preferred. 7. if there has been a miscarriage of 
						justice by an apparent wrong acceptance of a plea of 
						guilty. In this case, it is important to note that the 
						appellant did not enter a plea of guilty, at the onset. 
						The trial had actually proceeded to the stage: where the 
						prosecution had closed its case after leading viva voce 
						evidence and also tendering documentary evidence. It was 
						at the stage where: the appellant who had all along 
						appeared by counsel, was called upon to open his defence 
						that he decided to change his plea from that of not 
						guilty to guilty. After that he confirmed to the court 
						that he fully well knew the import of the step he was 
						taking. It is important to draw a distinction between 
						the situation where an accused person, on being called 
						upon to plead to charges against him for the first time, 
						would enter a plea of guilty, and the other scenario, 
						like it happened in this case, where the appellant first 
						pleaded not guilty, and waited until after the 
						prosecution had closed their case, and he the appellant 
						had fully weighed his chances, so to speak, before 
						deciding to change his original plea of not guilty to 
						that of guilty. In electing this second option under the 
						circumstances that prevailed, the appellant who had the 
						full benefit of the experience or legal expertise of his 
						counsel cannot be heard to question the conviction based 
						on his own plea subsequently. This is more so having 
						regard to the prosecutor's statement; exhibit F; and 
						learned counsel's statement in.plea in mitigation of 
						sentence. In any case, learned counsel has alleged that 
						the appellant pleaded guilty to a non-existent crime and 
						that no offence was disclosed. I will now turn attention 
						to the grounds of appeal. In his answer to ground one of 
						the appeal learned counsel for the respondent tried to 
						justify the imposition of the sentence on what he called 
						the prevalent practice of intermarriages between 
						officers and other ranks. This allegation is not in 
						anyway supported by evidence and I will discount it. In 
						similar vein learned counsel for appellant 
						over-exaggerated the sentence by calling it a dismissed 
						with disgrace. The evidence on record however shows a 
						lesser sentence of dismissal simpliciter, and not 
						dismissal with disgrace. I am satisfied that the 
						existing law in the Ghana Armed Forces while not 
						specifically prohibiting marriages between officers and 
						other ranks, succinctly sets out procedure for such 
						marriage and specifically forbids marriages between 
						officers and female other rank unless they both, or at 
						least the female first submitted an application for 
						voluntary retirement and that had been granted. Until 
						such an application for voluntary retirement had been 
						granted, and the female other rank had ceased being a 
						member of the Armed Forces, any marriage contracted 
						between her and any officer would fall foul of the law. 
						Section 54 (3) (6) makes &quot;any regulations, orders or 
						instructions published for the general information and 
						guidance of the Armed Force to which he is attached or 
						seconded;.. an act, conduct disorder or neglect to the 
						prejudice of good order and discipline&quot;. In his evidence 
						PW2 said the issue of marriage was a subject matter of 
						their curriculum in training adding that that formed 
						part of the Fundamental Officer Training. Even though 
						Capt (GN) K.P. Faidio (GH/1970) did not testify in the 
						trial, to be cross-examined, his statement in Exhibit F, 
						the summary of evidence, formed part of the case of the 
						prosecution and learned counsel for the appellant could 
						have exercised his right of cross-examination to 
						discredit that as part of the prosecution's case, had he 
						not elected to change the appellant's plea to guilty. 
						The plea of guilty, once recorded, no further proof of 
						the case against the accused was necessary. It is rather 
						surprising that after learned counsel had advised the 
						appellant to change his plea, that counsel would in this 
						appeal submit that the evidence of PW2 that officers 
						were instructed not to marry from other rank was not 
						proved in evidence. On the record, after Pw2 had given 
						his evidence in chief, he was subjected to cross 
						examination by counsel for the appellant. Counsel 
						however, failed rather woefully to discredit Pw2's 
						evidence. Where counsel failed to properly fight his 
						defence through, he cannot be heard on appeal to allege 
						that the issue was not proved. I will uphold the 
						submission by counsel for the respondent that the 
						conviction and sentence were not wrong. There was 
						overwhelming evidence to show that the appellant's 
						conduct was in everyway prejudicial to good order and 
						discipline and therefore compromised the security of the 
						Armed, Force and that section 54 of Act 105 imposes an 
						obligation on the appellant while serving as a naval 
						officer to conduct himself in a manner not prejudicial 
						to good order and discipline and proceed to dismiss this 
						ground of appeal also. Is the law in the true sense 
						discriminatory. Every organization which is interested 
						and concerned in its own welfare, development and 
						progress, would operate on laws to best project its 
						growth and prosperity for the enhancement of its goals. 
						The respondent is not an exception to this, Here I see 
						them saying that they are a security organization: whose 
						success is built on high disciplinary code. One of the 
						best ways to maintain their image is to make laws to the 
						effect that any commissioned: officer who decides to 
						enter into matrimonial relation with a female other rank 
						is not forbidden to do so, provided that the woman first 
						retires or resigns from the service. I do not see the 
						law or regulation as discriminary or anathema to the 
						enjoyment of fundamental rights. One who enters an 
						organization as a member, is presumed to know the rules 
						and regulations existing therein and to have explicitly 
						or implicitly agreed to be bound by them. I do not 
						detect or associate any discriminative aspect of the 
						law, much more to say it frowns on fundamental 
						liberties. COUNSEL: ERIC PONGO FOR THE APPELLANT CAPT.
