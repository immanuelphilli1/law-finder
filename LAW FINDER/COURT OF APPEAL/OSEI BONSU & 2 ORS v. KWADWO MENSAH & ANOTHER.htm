						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">OWUSU J.A.:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 
						plaintiffs/appellants hereinafter referred to as 
						Appellants, issued a writ against the 
						Defendants/Respondents referred to simply as Respondents 
						jointly and severally for the following reliefs:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(i) &quot;An order that plot 
						No. 17 Block 111, Ampabame, Kumasi was acquired by Kwame 
						Appiah (deceased) and developed by Akwasi Obeng 
						(deceased) and is thus family property.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(ii) &quot;An order that the 
						transaction which took place between Akwasi Obeng 
						(deceased) and defendants herein which led to the 
						possession of the house by Defendants was a customary 
						law pledge and not a sale and for a further order 
						nullifying any purported sale of the said house and 
						land.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(iii) An order for 
						recovery of possession of the said house from Defendants 
						upon tendering the pledge sum of N ¢600.00 (six Hundred 
						Cedis).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Respondents 
						resisted the Appellant's Claim contending that the plot 
						No.17, Block 111, Ampabame, Kumasi with the building 
						thereon was the property of Kwasi Obeng. That they 
						bought the said building outright from Kwasi Obeng after 
						satisfying themselves that Obeng was the undisputed 
						owner of the plot with the building thereon.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">They therefore 
						counter-claimed for &quot;title to House number Block 111, 
						plot 17 Ampabame, Kumasi through sale to them by late 
						Kwasi Obeng. At the end of the trial, the Appellant's 
						Claim was dismissed and even though the court did not 
						decree legal title in the 1st Respondent it declared him 
						equitable owner and entered Judgment in favour of the 
						Respondents on their counter-claim. Dissatisfied with 
						the Judgment, the Appellants have come to this court, 
						complaining that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The Judgment is 
						against the weight of the evidence on record.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Four more additional 
						grounds were filed alleging errors of law on the part of 
						the trial Judge.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Going through the 
						grounds of Appeal the main issue which calls for 
						determination is whether the transaction between Kwasi 
						Obeng and the 1st Respondent which led him into 
						possession and subsequent occupation was a pledge as 
						contended by the Appellants or an outright sale as 
						claimed by the Respondents.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the evidence before 
						the court, the issue of ownership of the house was 
						resolved by the trial court which made a positive 
						finding that the house is the self-acquired property of 
						Kwasi Obeng and not his family property.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this appeal, that 
						finding is not being seriously challenged. Indeed, in 
						counsel for the Appellant's written statement of case, 
						he submitted that whether the property belonged to Kwasi 
						Obeng or Opanin Kwasi Appiah or both, is neither here 
						nor there. According to counsel </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;what is material is 
						that both of them are dead and by law, the property 
						(which ever of the two it belonged to) has devolved upon 
						their family represented by Plaintiffs&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This does not represent 
						the true state of the law with regard to Kwasi Obeng who 
						died in 1993. If the property was Obeng's self-acquired 
						property then upon his death intestate 1993, it would 
						devolve upon his wife and children in accordance with 
						P.N.D.C. Law 111 which came into force in June 1985 but 
						not on his family as counsel stated.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">To establish the family 
						character of the property, the plaintiffs who claim 
						title to the property, must support their claim with 
						cogent and convincing evidence. The well settled rule of 
						law is that in an action for declaration of title to 
						land, a plaintiff could only succeed on the strength of 
						his own case. This was re-echoed in the case of DUAGBOR 
						VRS AKYEA DJAMSON [1984-86] 1 GLR 697 by Abban J.A. of 
						blessed memory (as he then was). The learned Justice of 
						Appeal had this to say&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The plaintiff having 
						sought a declaration of title to the land in dispute 
						could only succeed on the strength of his case and not 
						on the weakness of the co-defendant's case. It is true 
						that the co-defendant also counter-claimed for 
						declaration of title but that is beside the point. For 
						the co-defendant's counter claim could not in any way 
						lighten the weight of the burden on the plaintiff to 
						establish his title to the land by preponderance of 
						admissible evidence.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The other well known 
						principle of law is that a claimant could take advantage 
						of any weaknesses in his opponents case only where he 
						had succeeded in establishing a prima facie case 
						himself. See the case of ODAMTEY VRS CLOCUH and Anor. 
						[1989-90] 1 GLR p. 14.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this appeal, we need 
						not look far to discover that what the Appellants are 
						doing is to use the weakness in the Respondents counter 
						claim, to prop their weak claim. Their claim is one 
						against the estate of a deceased person and as such must 
						be scrutinised with the utmost suspicion as Kwasi Obeng 
						is now dead.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the case of MOSES 
						AND OTHERS VRS. ANANE [1989-90] 2 GLR, 694 at 697 the 
						court per Francois J.A. held that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;A claim against a 
						deceased's estate must be viewed with suspicion. Proof 
						must be strict and utterly convincing, as one of the 
						protagonists is dead and cannot assert himself.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Brett MR stated the law 
						in the case of GARNET, IN RE GANDY VRS MACAULEY [1885] 
						31 ch. D p.1 as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The law is that when 
						an attempt is made to charge a deceased person in a 
						matter, in which if he were alive he might have answered 
						that charge the evidence ought to be looked at with 
						great care; the evidence ought to be thoroughly sifted 
						and the mind of the Judge who hears it ought to be, 
						first of all, in a state of suspicion ...........&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">What is the nature of 
						the evidence led in the court below in proof of (i) the 
						family character of the property, the subject matter of 
						the dispute, (ii) that the transaction between Kwasi 
						Obeng and the 1st Respondents was a pledge but not a 
						sale? The 2nd plaintiff who gave evidence in proof of 
						the family character of the property told the court it 
						was his grand uncle Kwame Appiah who acquired the plot 
						from Twafohene of Ampabame.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">For a long time, the 
						plot was undeveloped so the town development committee 
						wrote to Appiah that they wanted to recover the plot. 
						Appiah and his family went to the committee and pleaded 
						with them so the land was given back to him. He tendered 
						Exhibit &quot;A&quot; the letter from the committee to Appiah, the 
						contents of which I reproduce hereunder&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;I am writing this to 
						inform you that, according to your letter written to me 
						on the 3rd DAY OF JUNE, 1961, you stated that you would 
						be able to erect a building on your plot within (1) 
						year. This was agreed between you and the committee 
						members, hoping that on the 3rd of June, 1962, something 
						will be done by you.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Since that time has 
						passed, and no sign or no attempt has been made by you 
						about the erection of the building, I am writing to tell 
						you that the plot has been taken from you, and is now 
						the property of the Town Committee and the Committee is 
						ready to give the plot to anybody who is ready to erect 
						the building.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">From Exhibit &quot;A&quot; the 
						committee wrote to inform him that the plot had been 
						taken away for failure on his part to develop it but not 
						to warn him that the committee was going to take it 
						away.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The evidence of the 2nd 
						plaintiff is that his great uncle Appiah started 
						development on the land but it was Kwasi Obeng who 
						continued with the development to its completion. He 
						however told the court they (presumably members of the 
						family) contributed money to purchase cement. He did not 
						state how much was contributed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This piece of evidence 
						contradicts the plaintiffs own pleadings. In paragraph 4 
						of the statement of claim, the plaintiffs averred that, 
						Kwame Appiah, many years after acquiring plot No. 17, 
						Block 111 did not develop it. That upon a threat from 
						the committee, Opanin Appiah caused his nephew Akwasi 
						Obeng to develop it by putting up a three bedroom out 
						house with kitchen and toilet. According to the 
						statement of claim, it was Obeng who financed the whole 
						construction while the plaintiffs kept the cement, 
						fetched water and supervised the labourers. From the 
						statement of claim, the property acquired family 
						character because the plot was acquired by one member of 
						family and developed by another.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">If indeed the plot was 
						acquired by Appiah and developed by Obeng it would have 
						acquired family character from the beginning and Obeng 
						would have acquired only a life interest in the property 
						and could not transfer any more interest than what he 
						himself had.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">From the evidence 
						however, the property acquired family character because 
						other members apart from Obeng contributed money towards 
						its development.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The position of the law 
						is that the assistance in cash or labour which members 
						of the family give to another member to develop his 
						self-acquired property must be substantial to give the 
						property a mark of family character.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In answer to this 
						claim, the Respondents case is that indeed plot No 17 
						Block 111, in the Kumasi District was taken away from 
						Kwame Appiah in terms of Exhibit 'A&quot;. That the said 
						plot, from Exhibit &quot;l &quot; was allocated to Kwasi Obeng who 
						single-handedly developed it and therefore was his 
						self-acquired property. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The evidence of D.W. 1 
						Samuel Oliver Nyamesem Adusei is that in the middle of 
						the 1960s, he was secretary to the Town Development 
						committee which was responsible for allocation of lands. 
						He told the court that when the committee came into 
						being, a plot had already been allocated to Opanin Kwame 
						Appiah. For a long time this plot was not developed. 
						Opanin Appiah was invited by the committee to find out 
						from him whether he was ready to develop the plot. He 
						told the committee that he did not have the means to do 
						so. The committee therefore took the plot from him 
						because its desire was to have the town developed. At 
						the same time, his grand nephew Kwasi Obeng, approached 
						the committee for a plot and because the committee was 
						not merely interested in denying Opanin Appiah the use 
						of the plot, it was allocated to his grand nephew Obeng.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Under cross-examination 
						this witness denied that the plot was restored to Opanin 
						Appiah. He insisted that it was allocated to his grand 
						nephew Obeng. D.W. 1's evidence completely debunks the 
						plaintiffs contention that the plot was restored to 
						Appiah.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">If Obeng acquired the 
						plot as evidenced in Exhibit &quot;l &quot; and single-handedly 
						developed it, as the plaintiffs evidence failed to 
						establish the family character of the property, then it 
						is his self acquired property as the trial court rightly 
						found and he could in his life time deal with it without 
						any reference to the family.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The parties are ad idem 
						that during his lifetime there was a transaction between 
						him and the 1st Respondent affecting this property. They 
						sharply differ as to the nature of the transaction.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiffs contend 
						that Kwasi Obeng pledged this property to the 
						Respondents and as such pledged property, it can be 
						redeemed at any time. The big question that quickly 
						comes to my mind, is by whom? With the coming into force 
						of the intestate succession law P.N.D.C. Law 111, can 
						the family maintain an action for its redemption even if 
						the property was pledged? Kwasi Obeng died in 1993 and 
						from the evidence of P.W. 2, his son, he left behind 
						children upon whom the properly would have devolved on 
						his death intestate under the law.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 1st Respondent 
						however contends that the transaction between him and 
						Obeng in connection with the property was an outright 
						sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiffs 
						therefore had to lead sufficient and admissible evidence 
						to establish that indeed the property was pledged. The 
						second plaintiff's evidence is that he only heard that 
						the building had been pledged and could not even 
						remember when. It was when he heard of the pledge that 
						the family appealed to Boshenhene Nana Adom Dankwa to 
						intervene for them to refund the money to redeem the 
						property as same did not belong to Obeng.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was when they 
						approached the Respondents that they (Respondents) 
						refused to give the property back to them because they 
						claimed they bought it. At this time, according to him, 
						Opanin Appiah was dead.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Under 
						cross-examination, the following questions were put to 
						him which I find interesting and note worthy with the 
						answers given by the witness&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q: &#8220;You regarded this 
						house as your family house with contributions from your 
						sister and Kwaku Duah and you allowed Kwasi Obeng to 
						pledge it?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A: He was in control of 
						the house and at the time he was pledging it, the family 
						did not know. That was why we later sent appeal to 
						redeem it?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q: When you got to know 
						that Akwasi Obeng had pledged the house, Akwasi Obeng 
						was alive?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A: &quot;Yes he was alive 
						and he was quarrelling with the family as a result of 
						his misdeeds&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q: So Kwasi Obeng in 
						his life time, never accepted that he had pledged the 
						house to the defendant?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A: &quot;He did not accept 
						that.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Cross-examined further 
						however, he said Obeng said he had pledged it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Obeng did not make any 
						attempt in his lifetime from 1967-1993 when he died to 
						redeem the 
						property.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Even in 1973, when a 
						similar action was instituted, Kwasi Obeng was not a 
						party to it even though he was alive. This action was 
						never prosecuted and after so many adjournments, it was 
						struck out.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The evidence of the 1st 
						Respondent is that when he bought the house from Obeng, 
						it was uncompleted. He completed it before he went into 
						occupation. This piece of evidence is confirmed by P.W. 
						3 who said he was engaged by Kwasi Obeng to develop the 
						property to roofing level &quot;Pledge in customary law is 
						the delivery of possession and custody of property, real 
						or personal, by a person to his creditor to hold and use 
						until a debt due is paid, an article borrowed is 
						returned or replaced, or an obligation is discharged.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">See principles of 
						customary land law in Ghana by the eminent Jurist N.A. 
						Ollenu (2nd edition) p. 101.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Its purpose 
						essentially is not so much to hold the pledged property 
						as security, as to have its use as interest on the 
						amount borrowed&nbsp; .............&quot; (emphasis is mine)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">If the plaintiff's 
						assertion that the property was pledged is true, of what 
						use could the 1st Respondent put an uncompleted 
						building? Would he have parted with the ¢600 at the 
						time, just to take custody of a property, from which he 
						could not derive any benefit? The answer readily to my 
						mind, is no.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I am therefore 
						affirming the trial Judge's finding that the transaction 
						between Kwasi Obeng and the 1st Respondent was not a 
						pledge.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Was it then a sale as 
						the 1st Respondent contended? The Respondents 
						counter-claimed for a declaration of title which they 
						claimed was acquired through sale. They also, 
						notwithstanding the fact that the Appellants failed to 
						establish the pledge, had an equal task to discharge the 
						burden of persuasion by leading sufficient evidence to 
						establish a requisite degree of belief concerning the 
						sale in the mind of the court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">What evidence then was 
						led by the 1st Respondent in proof of the fact that he 
						bought the uncompleted property which he later completed 
						from Kwasi Obeng. The 1st Respondent gave evidence and 
						called one witness, the secretary to the Town 
						Development Committee.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">His evidence is that he 
						heard that Kwasi Obeng who was the owner of the house 
						was selling it. He saw the allocation paper and site 
						plan on the property and they were in the name of Kwasi 
						Obeng.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Obeng prepared a 
						document which he and Obeng together with the 2nd 
						Respondent his brother, took to the Chief of Ampabame 
						for execution. The document was an agreement which was 
						witnessed by the 1st Plaintiff and his mother.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">According to him, the 
						house consisted of 3 bedrooms, Kitchen, toilet and 
						bathrooms. It was roofed, with the kitchen, toilet and 
						bath having concrete floor. There were windows and 
						doorframes.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He added a storeroom 
						and fixed doors, windows, locks and keys and plastered 
						and ceiled the rooms. He also constructed a gutter 
						behind the house, painted it and connected water and 
						electricity. That these facilities bear his name and he 
						pays property rate in his name.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He told the court it 
						took him about 1 year to put the house in habitable 
						state and in 1968 he moved into it with his family and 
						was in occupation since then.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He tendered photocopies 
						of the allocation paper and the site plan with Kwasi 
						Obeng's name at the trial. The agreement was not 
						produced with the explanation that he attached it to his 
						defence in the earlier suit in 1973.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He led no further 
						evidence oral or documentary in proof of the purchase. 
						The evidence of his only witness is to the effect that 
						plot No. 17, Block 111 was allocated to Kwasi Obeng by 
						the Committee. He did not call the 2nd Respondent, his 
						brother with whom he went to the chief of Ampabame for 
						the execution of the agreement between him and Obeng, if 
						indeed there was any such agreement.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the case of 
						MAJOLAGBE VRS. LARBI &amp; OTHERS [1959] GLR 192, Ollenu J. 
						(as he then was) defined proof in law as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Proof in law is the 
						establishment of facts by proper legal means where a 
						party makes an averment capable of proof in some 
						positive way, eg by producing documents, description of 
						things reference to other facts, instances, or 
						circumstances and his averment is denied he does not 
						prove it by merely going into the witness ... and 
						repeating that averment on oath or having it repeated on 
						oath by his witness. He proves it by producing other 
						evidence of facts and circumstances, from which the 
						court can be satisfied that what he avers is true.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Admittedly, from the 
						evidence on record there was no such proof of the sale 
						by the 1st Respondent and I endorse the trial Judge's 
						finding that the evidence in support of the sale was not 
						sufficient enough for a court to decree title in his 
						favour.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial Judge 
						therefore erred when he entered Judgment in favour of 
						the Respondents on their counter-claim. I will therefore 
						set aside the Judgment entered in favour of the 
						Respondent. He is however entitled to the protection of 
						the law as someone in possession until somebody with a 
						better title comes.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the evidence, there

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I had the privilege and 
						the opportunity of seeing in advance the judgment which 
						my learned sister Miss Owusu J.A. has just read. I 
						observed that she dealt exhaustively with the question 
						as to whether the transaction which the litigating 
						parties herein originally entered into was a customary 
						pledge or sale. I am in entire agreement with the 
						reasoning of my learned sister and the conclusions she 
						has come to. I however, propose to make a contribution 
						solely on the issue of onus of proof and to touch 
						briefly on the evidence adduced by the 
						Plaintiff-Appellants at the close of their case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the notice of Appeal 
						filed on 20th October, 2001, counsel for the 
						Plaintiff/Appellants stated that the judgment is against 
						the weight of the evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In arguing this ground, 
						learned counsel submitted that the onus was on the 
						Respondents who asserted that the transaction was a sale 
						to establish the sale. Counsel submitted further that 
						the Respondents have failed to produce any</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) written document 
						evidencing a sale.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) registered 
						instrument of sale</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) witnesses to the 
						sale transaction.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Respondents, on the 
						other hand maintained that the Appellants who asserted 
						that the transaction was a pledge bore the burden of 
						establishing that pledge. As the matter stood, each 
						party based his case on the issue which, if proved, 
						would exclude the consideration of the other party's 
						case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Part II of the 
						provisions of the Evidence Decree which deal with the 
						burden of proof covers on the one hand the burden of 
						producing evidence under sections 11, 12, and 13. Taking 
						into consideration section 10, the expression &quot;burden of 
						persuasion,&#8221; should be interpreted to mean the quality, 
						quantum, amount, degree or extent of evidence a party is 
						obliged to adduce in order to satisfy the requirement of 
						proving a fact. Thus the burden of persuasion is 
						different from the burden of producing evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Under section 11, 12 
						and 13, and particularly section 179 (1) the burden of 
						producing evidence means the duty or obligation resting 
						on a party to lead evidence. They relate to which of the 
						parties should be the first to lead evidence before the 
						other's evidence is led.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">My view is that it is 
						the Plaintiffs who will lose first, who has the duty or 
						obligation to lead evidence in order to forestall a 
						ruling being given against him: see section 11 (1) 
						N.R.C.D. 323 which provides as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;For the purpose of 
						this Decree, the burden of producing evidence means the 
						obligation of a party to introduce sufficient evidence 
						to avoid a ruling against him on the issue.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The position in the 
						instant case according to the Defendant-Respondents is 
						that the land was given to Kwasi Obeng by the Town 
						Development Committee and he started to develop it in 
						l968. He then proceeded to sell the house he had 
						single-handedly erected thereon in its incomplete state 
						to the 1st Defendant who completed and improved it and 
						took possession of the house. The Plaintiff-Appellant's 
						claim that the transaction which took place between 
						Kwasi Obeng (Deceased) and the Defendants which led to 
						the possession of the house by the Defendants was a 
						customary pledge and therefore their claim for recovery 
						of possession was justified. Pledge is a positive 
						averment which must be proved and its terms clearly 
						established. If the Plaintiffs who pleaded pledge gave 
						no evidence the averments of pledge would remain 
						unproved. A ruling that no pledge has been proved or 
						established would go against the Plaintiff and that 
						would mean further that the basis of the claim for 
						recovery of possession would have failed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Evidence Decree, 
						however, makes provision for the duty or obligation to 
						adduce evidence to shift from one party to the other. 
						This is the rational behind the provisions of section 14 
						of the Evidence Decree 1975 (NRCD 323) which reads:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Except as otherwise 
						provided by law, and unless and until it is shifted a 
						party has the burden of persuasion as to each fact, the 
						existence or non-existence of which is essential to the 
						claim or defence he is asserting.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instant case 
						where the Plaintiffs relied on a pledge whilst the 
						Defendants stuck to a sale, it is evident from the 
						provisions of the Evidence Decree 1975 (NRCD 323) that 
						the duty or obligation on the Plaintiffs was to have 
						produced sufficient evidence so that the trial court 
						would conclude that the existence of a pledge was more 
						probable than its non-existence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is in the light of 
						these provisions in the Evidence Decree (NRCD 323) that 
						I am unable to agree with learned counsel for the 
						Plaintiffs that the burden of producing evidence rests 
						on the Defendants. In terms of NRCD 323, therefore, to 
						duty or obligation is on the party against whom a ruling 
						on the issues before court would be given if he failed 
						to lead sufficient evidence to establish them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The following 
						cross-examination of 2nd Plaintiff after his evidence in 
						chief is instructive:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q: So who was regarded 
						as the owner after the completion of the house?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A: Kwasi Obeng for he 
						was my mothers eldest child.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q: When was the house 
						pledged?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A: I cannot remember 
						the year but I heard that the building had been pledged 
						hence the appeal to redeem the pledge.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q: You regarded this 
						house as your family house with contributions from your 
						sisters and Kwaku Duah and you allowed Kwasi Obeng to 
						pledge it?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A. He was in control of 
						the house and at the time he was pledging it the family 
						did not know. That was why we later sent appeal to 
						redeem it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q: When you got to know 
						that Akwasi Obeng had pledged the house, Kwasi Obeng was 
						alive?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A: Yes, he was alive 
						and he was quarrelling with the family as a result of 
						his misdeeds.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q: So Kwasi Obeng in 
						his lifetime never accepted that he had pledged the 
						house to defendants?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A: He did not accept 
						that.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q: He told you he had 
						sold the house?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A: He said pledged it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was plain that at 
						the end of the Plaintiff&#8217;s own evidence, the quality of 
						the evidence which they had so far adduced was nowhere 
						near the standard of proof normally required of a 
						Plaintiff who assumes the burden of proving the 
						existence of their claim. On the contrary, the 2nd 
						Plaintiff&#8217;s answers to questions rather supported the 
						Defendant-Respondents claim that the transaction which 
						took place between Kwasi Obeng and the 1st Defendant was 
						not a pledge. I agree with my learned sister that the 
						Plaintiffs failed to establish the existence of a pledge 
						as well as all the other conclusions she reached.</span></p>
