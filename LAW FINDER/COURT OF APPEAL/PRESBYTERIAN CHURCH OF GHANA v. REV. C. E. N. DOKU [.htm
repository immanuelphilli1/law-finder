						<span style="font-family: Arial">B. T. ARYEETEY, J. A.:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The claim of the 
						Plaintiffs/Appellants before the trial High Court, 
						Sunyani was for an order for recovery of the manse and 
						all properties therein from the Defendant/Respondent who 
						had been retired prematurely from the service of the 
						Plaintiff Church. Following his retirement, the 
						appellant church paid the respondent a total of ¢627,992 
						comprising his gratuity and transport fare after an 
						amount of ¢162 had been deducted from his entitlement. 
						The respondent also accepted the payment of monthly 
						pension of ¢42,482 from the date of retirement. He 
						however, did not move out of the manse contrary to the 
						expectation of the church. The respondent counterclaimed 
						for the following reliefs:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) The gross monthly 
						salaries of the remaining 17 years of service.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) The payment of 
						¢162,000 with interest at the current bank rate being 
						part of his entitlements.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) An order of 
						perpetual injunction restraining the Plaintiffs and/or 
						their agents from interfering in any way with the&nbsp; 
						Defendant's stay in the manse until the final 
						determination of the case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial Court ordered 
						the respondent to surrender vacant possession of the 
						manse to the church and awarded ¢5,000,000 compensation 
						to be paid to the respondent in respect of his 
						counter-claim for gross monthly salary of the remaining 
						17 years of his service. He was also given judgment for 
						the ¢162,000 which was deducted from his entitlement 
						without the award of interest on that sum. The 
						appellants filed 6 grounds of appeal but limited 
						themselves to the first 3 grounds of appeal when they 
						filed the statement of their case. The 3 grounds are:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;(a) That the learned 
						judge erred in awarding to the Defendant ¢5,000,000 
						compensation, a relief which the Defendant never sought 
						for in his counterclaim. Besides; the Defendant having 
						agreed to accept his early retirement and having 
						consequently taken part in his pension and monthly 
						pension and having directed where the Plaintiffs should 
						pay his monthly pension, was not entitled to any further 
						monetary payments from the Plaintiff except his pension.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) That the learned 
						judge ought to have held that the Defendant was estopped 
						by his conduct from challenging the propriety of his 
						early retirement.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) That the Defendant 
						was unable to prove that the Plaintiff owed to him the 
						sum of ¢162,000.00&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I propose to deal first 
						with ground (b) of the appeal namely the learned judge 
						ought to have held that the Defendant was estopped by 
						his conduct from challenging the propriety of his early 
						retirement. It must be pointed out that ground (b) 
						listed in the notice of appeal filed on 30th March, 
						1998, bears no resemblance to ground (b) listed in the 
						statement of the appellants&#8217; case. In spite of my 
						difficulty in identifying what ground (b) of the appeal 
						really is, I would like to comment briefly on the two 
						versions as presented by the notice of appeal and the 
						statement of the appellants&#8217; case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The ground (b) listed 
						in the notice of appeal, speaks of failure by the trial 
						Court to hold that &#8220;the Defendant was estopped by his 
						conduct from challenging the propriety of his early 
						retirement&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">According to paragraph 
						7 of the appellants amended reply filed on 26th May, 
						1997, the appellants' plea of estoppel was as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The Plaintiff says 
						that the Defendant is estopped by conduct from denying 
						that he has been retired from the Presby Church of 
						Ghana&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The ground (b) of the 
						appeal listed in the notice of appeal speaks of a very 
						different estoppel that was not pleaded. It is very 
						obvious that the Defendant did not deny that he was 
						prematurely retired from the service of the appellant 
						church. However, the record of appeal is replete with 
						information that the respondent, right from the onset, 
						challenged the propriety of his retirement. What is 
						listed in ground (b) of the statement of the Plaintiffs' 
						case is not what was pleaded in the amended reply of the 
						appellants and therefore, the learned trial judge did 
						not err in not coming to any conclusion in relation to 
						that.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In respect of the new 
						ground (b) which is listed in the Statement of the 
						Appellants' case, Counsel for the appellants, Dr. Seth 
						Twum has, sought to create the impression that although 
						the respondent was not given any opportunity to answer 
						any charge against him, there is sufficient indication 
						of series of misconduct on his part to justify his 
						premature retirement especially when he did not take 
						steps to improve upon his personal relations. Counsel 
						for the appellants expressed his criticism of the 
						finding of the trial judge in the following words:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The learned trial 
						judge on page 77, lines 39-45 expressed the view that 
						the failure of the Church to give the Defendant a 
						hearing and thus depriving him of the chance of 
						defending himself was a breach of natural justice. With 
						respect, this approach tends to over judicialise the 
						proceedings of domestic bodies. There is a need for a 
						clear understanding of the distinction between public 
						law bodies and the equally important distinction between 
						public law issues and private issues &#8230; It is submitted 
						that where a party has been given an opportunity of 
						presenting his case in adequate form contradicting every 
						statement prejudicial to him, the audi alteram partem 
						rule does not require that the proceedings should be 
						conducted as a trial in a Court of law. Indeed, the rule 
						does not contemplate oral hearing unless some statute 
						expressly says so. Local Government Board v. Arlidge 
						(1915) AC120&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In all the fairness it 
						would be worthwhile to turn our attention to the written 
						submission of the respondent himself which is very 
						difficult to follow. At least, he makes reference to the 
						false allegations which were made against him which 
						formed the basis of his arbitrary suspension.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the opening 
						paragraphs of the Respondent's letter to the Presbytery 
						Clerk dated 27th August, 1994, Exhibit 4, the following 
						is recorded:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Paragraphs 318 and 319 
						of the Regulations Practice and Procedure of the 
						Presbyterian Church, Exhibit 5 reads as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;318&#8212;The censures of 
						the Church are Admonition, Rebuke, Suspension, 
						Deposition from office, and excommunication, and they 
						are administered only on confession proof of sin or 
						offence. Private admonition, which is not a censure, may 
						in certain cases meet the ends of discipline.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">319&#8212;Suspension of a 
						person under scandal from performance of duties, or even 
						from the communion during the investigation of the 
						scandal, it is not a censure as long as the charge is 
						not judicially confessed or proved&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As pointed out by the 
						trial judge in his judgment at page 77 of the record of 
						appeal, the appellants' representative Rev. Dr. Prempeh 
						admitted that the respondent was prematurely retired 
						without a hearing as required by the Regulations, 
						Practice and Procedure of the Church, Exhibit 5. I am 
						therefore of the view that ground (b) in the forms in 
						which it was presented has no basis and it is 
						accordingly dismissed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I now turn my attention 
						to ground (a) of the appeal which is &#8220;that the learned 
						judge erred in awarding to the Defendant ¢5,000,000 
						compensation, a relief which the Defendant never sought 
						for in his counterclaim. Besides, the Defendant having 
						agreed to accept his early retirement and having 
						consequently taken part in his pension and monthly 
						pension and having directed where the Plaintiff should 
						pay his monthly pension, he is not entitled to any 
						further monetary payments from the Plaintiff except his 
						pension.&#8221; In the first place, in his Amended Statement 
						of Defence and Counter-claim, the respondent 
						counterclaimed for gross monthly salaries of the 
						remaining 17 years of service. The award of ¢5,000,000 
						by the learned trial judge came under that head of the 
						respondent's counterclaim after giving his reasons for 
						his inability to award the respondent his gross monthly 
						salaries for the remaining 17 years of service. It means 
						this is not a case of awarding compensation for what the 
						respondent had not asked for as submitted in the 
						statement of the appellants' case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In his notice to 
						contend that the decision of the Court below be varied, 
						the respondent asked for the award of the ¢5,000,000 
						compensation by the High Court to be enhanced. It has 
						therefore become necessary for me to examine the case 
						law which sheds some light on how damages in similar 
						circumstances should be assessed. In the case of Ghana 
						Cocoa Marketing Board v. Agbettoh and others digested in 
						[1983-86] GLRD 16, it was held by the Court of Appeal in 
						a case of unconstitutional retirement that the Defendant 
						board should pay each Plaintiff an amount equal to two 
						years salary in addition to receiving their entitlements 
						under their contract of employment. That decision was 
						given approval by the Supreme Court in the case of 
						Nartey-Tokoli v. Volta Aluminium Co. Ltd digested in 
						[1989-90] GLRD 112. Also in the Supreme Court judgment 
						in the case of Ghana National Trading Corporation and 
						Another v. Baiden reported in [1991] GLR 567, it was 
						held that in case of wrongful dismissal, it was 
						unrealistic to pay the respondent salary as though to 
						the date of judgment of the High Court he was rendering 
						service to the appellants. He was therefore, awarded 2 
						years salary as damages. In this case, it would be 
						unrealistic to award the respondent 17 years salary as 
						damages. Also in the light of the case law referred to 
						in this judgment, an award of ¢5,000,000 compensation to 
						the respondent is on the higher side and without any 
						basis. Accordingly, I would set that judgment aside. In 
						its place, I would award the respondent 2 years salary 
						as damages in addition to his entitlements.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellants' third 
						ground of appeal was that the respondent was unable to 
						prove that they owed him the amount of ¢162,000. It is 
						the contention of Counsel for the appellants that the 
						burden was on the respondent to prove that the 
						appellants owed him the sum of ¢162,000 which he failed 
						to discharge. That was because the appellants in their 
						pleading denied the claim of the respondent. What has to 
						be looked at is what gave rise to the claim of the 
						respondent in the Court below for the payment to him of 
						the amount of ¢162,000 plus interest. On the appellants' 
						own showing, an amount of ¢162,000 was deducted from the 
						respondent's total entitlement before payment was made 
						to him. The respondent's counterclaim for ¢162,000 plus 
						interest constituted a challenge to the deduction of 
						¢162,000 from his entitlement by the appellants. The 
						appellants were therefore called upon to satisfy the 
						trial Court as to the basis of the deduction. They 
						failed to do that. It is therefore the finding of the 
						trial Court that the appellants failed to offer any 
						explanation for the deduction of the sum of ¢162,000 
						from the entitlement of the respondent. That is, the 
						appellants failed to discharge the burden of 
						establishing by evidence the basis of the deduction of 
						¢162,000 from the entitlement of the respondent by them. 
						I am therefore of the opinion that the conclusion 
						reached by the trial judge should not be disturbed in 
						any way. That means ground (c) of the appellants&#8217; 
						grounds of appeal fails and is accordingly dismissed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Also, in the 
						respondent's notice of intention to contend that the 
						decision of the Court below be varied he asks for an 
						award of interest on the sum of&nbsp;&nbsp; ¢162,000 in respect of 
						which he obtained judgment in his counterclaim in the 
						Court below.&nbsp; I am of the opinion that the Court below 
						through inadvertence, did not make any order in respect 
						of the respondent's counterclaim for interest to which 
						he was entitled. I would therefore vary the order of the 
						Court below by awarding interest at prevailing bank 
						rate. Accordingly, I make an order for award of interest 
						in respect of the amount of ¢162,000, which was ordered 
						to be paid to the respondent, at the prevailing rate 
						from the date the respondent received payment of his 
						entitlement to the date of judgment of this Court.</span></p>
