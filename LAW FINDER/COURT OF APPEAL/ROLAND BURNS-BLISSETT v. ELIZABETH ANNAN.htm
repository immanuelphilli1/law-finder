						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is an appeal 
						against the judgment of the Circuit Court, Tarkwa dated 
						24th February, 1997 wherein the learned Circuit judge 
						entered judgment in favour of the plaintiff/respondent 
						[hereinafter described as the Respondent], on his claim 
						and dismissed the counterclaim of the 
						Defendant/Appellant [hereinafter called the Appellant].</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the court below, the 
						respondent sued for himself and the children of the late 
						Henry Francis Burns-Blisseth for a declaration of 
						ownership of House No. MS1 situate on main street 
						Tarkwa, possession thereof and perpetual injunction.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In her Statement of 
						Defence, the appellant counterclaimed against the 
						Respondent for a declaration that the house in dispute 
						is family property belonging to the Appellant's family.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In his statement of 
						claim as amended, the Respondent averred that his 
						grandfather was one Francis Burns-Blissett, a Sierra 
						Leonean national who came to the then Gold Coast, now 
						Ghana and worked with the Gold Coast Railway 
						Corporation.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The late Francis 
						Burns-Blissett married one Madam Ekua Duku, a Ghanaian 
						and they had two children, namely Henry Francis Burns 
						Blissett, the Respondent's father, and Arthur Roland 
						Blissett.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the course of his 
						work Francis Burns-Blissett, respondent's grandfather, 
						died in a rail accident and compensation arising out of 
						the accident was paid to his widow Madam Ekua Duku who 
						used some of it to put up a building Numbered MS.1 at 
						Tarkwa.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Madam Ekua Doku also 
						owned other houses No. TB,38 on Padmore Road, Tarkwa and 
						another along CYANIDE Road, Tarkwa.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">When the Respondent&#8217;s 
						paternal uncle, Arthur Roland Blissett died, and during 
						his final funeral rites in August, 1976, Madam Ekua Duku 
						informed members of her family that in the event of her 
						death the building on the CYANIDE road and the other 
						numbered MS. 1, should be inherited by her children and 
						grandchildren and House No. TB.38 which she built from 
						her own resources should be occupied by members of her 
						family.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In November, 1976, soon 
						after the respondent's paternal uncle passed away, Madam 
						Ekua Duku also died.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Just as respondent's 
						father, Henry Francis Blissett was preparing to perform 
						the funeral rites of Madam Ekua Duku scheduled for 
						March, 1977, he also died suddenly on 8th November, 
						1977.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After the funeral of 
						the respondent's father and Madam Ekua Duku had been 
						performed, a Fire Insurance policy on House No.MS.1 
						executed in 1972 between the State Insurance Company and 
						Madam Ekua Duku was discovered by respondent. Also 
						discovered by respondent was an affidavit sworn to by 
						Madam Ekua Duku transferring her interest as owner in 
						House Nos. T.B. 38, MS.1 and Plot Nos. 3 and 4 Cyanide 
						Road to her two sons, Messrs Henry F. Blissett and 
						Arthur Roland Blissett and her grandchildren by her two 
						sons begotten.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">According to the 
						Respondent, the family of Madam Ekua Duku took advantage 
						of the sudden death of Henry Francis Blissett and 
						assumed control over all the buildings.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Later the family gave 
						the building along the CYANIDE road to the children of 
						Arthur Roland Blissett. The Respondent and her siblings 
						got nothing. They were completely ignored.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was contended by the 
						Respondent that since the family of Madam Ekua Duku is 
						now occupying House No. TB38, it was only fair that he 
						[Respondent] and his siblings be given the other house 
						No. MS.1 by the family.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The story of the 
						appellant was that House No. MS.1 was family property 
						constructed through the joint efforts of Ebusuapanyin 
						Atta Boadi, Efua Nyaa, Kwesi Amissah and Nyaa Ekua, the 
						said Nyaa Ekua being the same person called Madam Ekua 
						Duku, the respondent's grandmother.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellant stated 
						that the Respondent has no stake whatsoever in House No. 
						MS.1 which is family property and that when the 
						appellant's predecessors learnt of attempts by Madam 
						Ekua Duku alias Nyaa Ekua to transfer ownership of the 
						disputed house to his two sons, they protested 
						vehemently to some elders who settled the matter in 
						favour of the family.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At the time this matter 
						came up for hearing, the evidence disclosed that the 
						elders mentioned as having settled the matter had all 
						died.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was pleaded by the 
						appellant in paragraph 4 of her Statement of Defence and 
						Counterclaim that the Respondent was estopped by conduct 
						and acquiescence from denying that the house in dispute 
						was family property.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In his judgment, the 
						learned trial judge dismissed the appellant's 
						counterclaim and upheld the respondent's claim and 
						declared that the Respondent and his brothers and 
						sisters should take possession of House No. MS.1, they 
						being owners of that house. The Appellant was also 
						restrained from interfering with the Respondent's title 
						to and possession of the said house.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned trial judge 
						made findings of fact and arrived at conclusions of law 
						based on the five issues set down to be heard and 
						determined and the evidence led before him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Those issues were as 
						follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(a) Whether or not 
						House No. MS.1 Main Street, Tarkwa was built with the 
						proceeds of compensation for Francis Burns Blissett 
						(deceased)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) Whether or not the 
						house in dispute is family property.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) Whether or not the 
						plaintiff or the Defendant is [sic] estopped from making 
						their respective claims.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d) Whether or not the 
						Plaintiff is entitled to his claim.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(e) Whether or not 
						Defendant is entitled to her counterclaim.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial judge 
						resolved all these issues in favour of the Respondent. 
						For instance on issue [a], the trial judge observed that 
						the only evidence given on it came from the respondent 
						who said his grandmother Nyaa Ekua was the source of his 
						information.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned judge took 
						the view that the respondent's evidence was hearsay but 
						it was admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule 
						under Section 123 [2] [a] of the Evidence Decree, 1975 
						[NRCD.323], the side note of which reads:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the same issue, the 
						trial judge stated that whether compensation money was 
						owed by Nyaa Ekua to build House No. MS.1 was an issue 
						whose resolution was dependent on other available 
						durative evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">And as there was 
						evidence on record, accepted by the parties that Nyaa 
						Ekua built House No. TB.38 before she put up the house 
						in dispute No. MS.1, the fact was indisputable that Nyaa 
						Ekua was capable of putting up House No. MS 1.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial judge also 
						expressed the opinion that since Exhibits 'A' and 'S', 
						respectively the receipt for the purchase of the land on 
						which House No. MS.1 was built and the Indenture on the 
						land were prepared in the name Nyaa Ekua those exhibits 
						speak to the fact that the land was purchased by Nyaa 
						Ekua in her personal capacity.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Reference was also made 
						by the trial judge to the evidence of the appellant that 
						when the principal members of Nyaa Ekua's family 
						discovered that she had made an affidavit [Exhibit 'F'] 
						claiming sole ownership of House Nos. MS.1, TB.38 and 
						plots Nos. 3 and 4 she was summoned for an arbitration 
						[or settlement] by members of her family and found 
						liable.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Regarding this piece of 
						evidence, the trial judge said if a settlement actually 
						took place then those who claimed joint ownership of 
						House No. MS.1 with Nyaa Ekua should out of prudence, 
						have retrieved all the copies of Exhibit 'F' which were 
						deposited with the Tarkwa/Abosso Urban council, the PWD 
						and the Tarkwa Stool land Administration so that Exhibit 
						'F' was either destroyed or rendered ineffective. That 
						this was not done by those who allegedly jointly built 
						the disputed house with Nyaa Ekua, two of whom on the 
						evidence namely Atta Buadu and Kwasi Amissah, were 
						literate, showed that House No. MS. 1 like the other 
						houses were solely built and owned by Nyaa Ekua.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">When the learned trial 
						judge came to consider the issue whether the house in 
						dispute was family property or not, he stated that Nyaa 
						Ekua made a customary gift inter vivos of the disputed 
						house to her sons and their children and gave written 
						expression to the gift so made in paragraphs 2 and 3 of 
						Exhibit 'F' which was an affidavit prepared after a 
						customary grant and on the principle emaciated in AWUAH 
						vrs. ADUTU [1987-88] GLR. Exhibit 'F' was only 
						documentary evidence of the grant and was not a 
						conveyance or instrument transferring title to land so 
						as to make it registrable under the Land Registry Act. 
						1962 [Act. 124].</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was also held by the 
						trial judge as a matter of law that having regard to the 
						evidence of the plaintiff that the intention of Nyaa 
						Akua clearly expressed and communicated by her was that 
						&quot;after her death, the houses should be given to her sons 
						and their children but House No. TB.38 should be taken 
						by members of her family&quot;, the grants made by Nyaa Ekua 
						were ambulatory and constituted an oral customary Will 
						and not a gift intervivos.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned trial judge 
						also found as a fact that Atta Buadee and Akoma Aso, 
						being the head and a member respectively of Nyaa Ekua's 
						family swore to an affidavit dated 4th August, 1978 
						vesting some of the houses mentioned in this action in 
						the children of Arthur Roland Blissett, this affidavit 
						having been annexed to a motion for default judgment 
						filed by the Respondent on 15th august sic, 1994.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the vesting 
						affidavit sworn to by Atta Buadee and Akoma Aso, the 
						learned judge found that even though members of Nyaa 
						Ekua's family purported to distribute her estate 
						according to her wishes as stated in Exhibit 'F', they 
						neglected to give any portion of the properties to the 
						children of Henry Blissett.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the circumstances, 
						the learned judge ruled that it would be equitable to 
						give one of the houses to the children of Henry Blissett 
						and since the Respondent, a child of Henry Blissett was 
						already in occupation of House No. 1, it was convenient 
						to order that house be allocated to them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the issue whether 
						the Respondent was estopped by conduct or acquiescence 
						from making his claim, the trial judge examined the 
						evidence and found that the Respondent had protested 
						when the interest of only the children of Arthur Roland 
						Blissett had been taken into account in the distribution 
						of the estate of Nyaa Ekua by members of her family. The 
						trial judge denied the right of Nyaa Ekua's family to 
						rely on the principle of estoppel when the hands of its 
						members had been soiled with naked fraud in not making 
						any provision for the Respondent and his siblings when 
						Nyaa Ekue'ssic estate was being distributed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Against this judgment 
						the appellant lodged the following grounds of appeal:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;[i] The learned trial 
						judge failed to appreciate the nature of the burden on 
						the Plaintiff in proving his case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">[ii] The learned judge 
						did not consider the defence and counterclaim of the 
						Defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">[iii] The learned trial 
						judge based his decision on matter completely different 
						from the case of the plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellant later 
						filed three additional grounds. They are:&#8212; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;[1] The learned trial 
						judge erred in law when he based his decision on a 
						rejected document.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">[2] The learned trial 
						judge also misdirected himself on the principles of law 
						involved in the case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">[3] The judgment is 
						against the weight of evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As to the burden of 
						proof, the law is that the appellant having counter 
						claimedsic, the burden was as much on her to prove her 
						counterclaim as it was on the respondent to prove her 
						claim.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">See MALM vrs. 
						LLUTTERODT. [1963] 1 GLRl. S.C.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">And the conclusions 
						arrived at by the learned trial judge show that he 
						decided to accept the story of the respondent for which 
						reason he dismissed the appellant's counterclaim.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have, I believe, 
						adequately given a detailed account of the decision of 
						the trial judge and I find nothing in his judgment 
						indicating that he did not consider the appellant's 
						defence and counterclaim.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The issues set down for 
						trial were amply addressed by the trial judge. While 
						dealing with the issue of estoppel which formed part of 
						the appellant's defence, the trial judge invoked section 
						26 of NRCD.323 and said it was not applicable against 
						the respondent inasmuch as he had protested when he was 
						denied a share in the estate of Nyaa Ekua.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Nowhere in the judgment 
						did I find that the trial judge based his decision on a 
						matter completely different from the case of the 
						respondent. Nor did I discover that the decision was 
						underpinned by a rejected document. The affidavit 
						attached to the appellant's application to set aside the 
						Respondents writ was part of the record before him and 
						he was entitled to refer to it and determine its effect 
						on the Respondent's claim and the appellant's 
						counterclaim,</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Assuming that the grant 
						of the properties of the late Nyaa Ekua did not qualify 
						as a gift inter vivos or a customary Will, there was 
						other sufficient evidence in record, including the 
						affidavit of Atta Buadee annexed to the application to 
						set aside the writ at page 14 of the record in which he 
						acknowledged that House No. MS. 1 was owned by Francis 
						Herbert Burns Blissett to support the learned trial 
						judge's decision upholding the Respondents claim.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the said affidavit, 
						Atta Buadee, who is deceased, stated in paragraphs 2 and 
						4 that the late F.H.B Blissett [the respondent's father] 
						was his brother and he [f.h.b. Blissett] was the owner 
						of House No. MS. 1, situate and lying at Commercial 
						Street, Tarkwa.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This appeal is grounded 
						essentially on the submission by counsel for the 
						appellant that on the balance of probabilities the 
						findings of the trial judge in support of his judgment 
						are not borne out by the evidence on record and that the 
						judge misdirected himself on the application of the law 
						to the facts [see CONCLUSION at page 10 of the Statement 
						of Appellant's case.]</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Considering that 
						counsel for the appellant meticulously listed the issues 
						set down for trial in the court below and argued as a 
						ground of appeal that the judgment of that court was 
						against the weight of evidence, it was necessary for 
						this court on appeal to examine the totality of the 
						evidence on record and to determine whether it 
						sufficiently supports the conclusions reached by the 
						trial judge as have done in this case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In AMPOMAH vrs. VOLTA 
						RIVER AUTHORITY [1989-90] 2 GLR.28, the Court of Appeal 
						held that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Where an appellant 
						charged that the judgment of the Court below was against 
						the weight of evidence, there was a presumption that the 
						judgment of the court below on the facts was correct.

						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;An appellate court

						<span style="font-family: Arial">The case of BONNEY vrs. 
						BONNEY [1992-93] GBR part 2 at page 799 also decided 
						that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;where an appellant 
						contended that a judgment was against the weight of 
						evidence, he assumed the burden of showing from the 
						evidence that this was in fact so. The argument that an 
						appeal was a rehearing and therefore the appellate court 
						was entitled to make its own mind on the facts and draw 
						inferences might well be so, but an appeal court ought 
						not under any circumstances interfere with the findings 
						of fact by the trial judge except where they were 
						clearly shown to be wrong.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this appeal, there 
						was ample evidence on record supporting the conclusions 
						arrived at on the facts by the trial judge.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I think the findings by 
						the trial judge that, the intention of Nyaa Ekua was 
						carried out by members of her family, albeit to the 
						exclusion of the children of Henry Francis Burns 
						Blissett; that House No. MS.1 like the other houses 
						mentioned in this action, was solely built and owned by 
						Nyaa Ekua; that House No. MS.1 was not jointly 
						constructed by Nyaa Ekua and other members of the family 
						and was therefore not family property; That the doctrine 
						of taches and acquiescence in no way affected the 
						conduct of the respondent and that it was rather the 
						appellant who was estopped from denying the interest of 
						the respondent in House No. MS.1, Tarkwa and that this 
						litigation was taken because of omissions or errors on 
						the part of the predecessors of the parties, are all 
						conclusions based on the evidence and I am unable to 
						discern any compelling reasons why those findings and 
						conclusions should be disturbed or overturned.</span></p>
