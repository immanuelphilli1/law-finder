												ARYEETEY, J.A.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A brief background to this 
												appeal is as follows: Until his 
												death on 25th February 1997 the 
												late Emmanuel Kotei Kwashie 
												carried out a business as 
												dressmakers and tailors with his 
												son and daughter, the appellants 
												herein. It is the contention of 
												the appellants that even though 
												their late father on his own 
												acquired the land on which besic 
												built the house where they 
												jointly carried out the 
												dressmakers and tailoring 
												business with him they gave 
												monetary assistance to him for 
												the construction of the house. 
												They did that from the United 
												Kingdom where they studied. On 
												their return from the United 
												Kingdom to Accra, they brought 
												with them industrial and 
												domestic machines as well as 
												other tools to reactivate the 
												business, of which they became 
												partners with their late father. 
												In acknow- ledgement of the 
												contributions made by the 
												appellants in various forms the 
												late Emmanuel Kotei Kwashie 
												executed a conveyance, exhibit B 
												transferring the property, House 
												No F390/1, Osu from himself as a 
												Donor to the plaintiffs and 
												himself as donee being tenants 
												in common. That took place on 
												13th September 1984. However, 
												upon his death it was discovered 
												that the late Emmanuel Kotei 
												Kwashie devised the said house 
												in his Will to his second wife 
												Emma Telfah and her children.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellants contend that 
												because of the execution of 
												exhibit B of which they are 
												beneficiaries their late father 
												lacked the capacity to devise in 
												his Will, exhibit A, House No. 
												390/1, Osu in favour of Emma 
												Telfah and her children, which 
												adversely affects their interest 
												in the said house. Therefore by 
												their writ of summons in the 
												court below, the 
												plaintiffs/appellants sued the 
												executors of their father&#8217;s 
												will, the defendants/respondents 
												herein claiming the following 
												reliefs:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) Declaration of title of all 
												that parcel of land situate at 
												Osu, Accra with building thereon 
												which land is particularly 
												described in the schedule 
												hereinafter referred and 
												commonly known as House No. 
												F390/1 Osu, Accra.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) Perpetual Injunction against 
												the defendants, their agents and 
												assigns restraining them from 
												interfering with the interest of 
												the plaintiffs in House No. 
												F390/1, Osu Accra.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(c) An order declaring the 
												devise of House No. F390/1 Osu 
												Accra to Emma Telfah and 
												children as contained in the 
												Last Will and Testament of 
												Emmanuel Kotei Kwashie as void 
												and of no effect.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The defendants counterclaimed 
												for:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) Account of all rents and 
												proceeds from House No. F390/1, 
												Osu Gorsee, Accra and payment 
												over to the defendant/executors.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) Account of all proceeds, 
												from the Testator&#8217;s tailoring 
												business, Kwashie Tailors and 
												payment to the 
												defendant/executors.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(c) An order nullifying the 
												incorporation and/or conversion 
												of the Testator&#8217;s sole 
												proprietorship into a limited 
												liability company&#8212;namely Kwashie 
												Tailors Limited.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The High Court dismissed the 
												appellants' claim as well as the 
												respondents' counterclaim.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellants appealed to this 
												Court and filed the following 
												four grounds of appeal:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(i) The judgment is against the 
												weight of evidence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(ii) The learned trial judge 
												erred in law in holding that the 
												gift contained in Exhibit B was 
												customary gift.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(iii) The learned trial judge 
												erred in law in holding that the 
												Testator Emmanuel Kwashie never 
												executed the Deed of Gift.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(iv) The learned trial judge 
												erred in holding that the 
												plaintiffs/appellants never 
												contributed to the construction 
												of House No. F390/1 Gorsee, 
												Osu-Accra.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I would first like to take 
												grounds (i) and (iv) of the 
												Grounds of Appeal together, 
												namely: (i) The judgment is 
												against the weight of evidence 
												and (iv) The learned trial judge 
												erred in holding that the 
												plaintiffs/appellants never 
												contributed to the construction 
												of House No. F390/1 Gorsee, 
												Osu-Accra. By paragraphs 6, 9 
												and 11 of the Statement of Claim 
												the plaintiffs give the 
												impression that they gave their 
												father monetary and other 
												assistance towards the 
												construction of the house, the 
												subject matter of this 
												litigation, which motivated 
												their late father to execute 
												exhibit B, making them part 
												owners of the house. They 
												challenge the trial judge's 
												conclusion that they never 
												contributed to the construction 
												of the house. It would therefore 
												be appropriate for us to look 
												briefly at the evidence adduced 
												on their behalf it support of 
												their stand that they indeed 
												contributed substantially 
												towards the construction of the 
												said House No. F390/1 which 
												caused their late father to 
												execute exhibit B in their 
												favour.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												At page 27 of the record of 
												appeal, we have the relevant 
												portion of the sworn evidence 
												of&nbsp; the first plaintiff as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;On June 4th 1989 there was a 
												fire outbreak at our fathers 
												former workshop on the Labadi 
												Accra Road near St Barnabas 
												Anglican Church, Osu. After the 
												fire outbreak, all the workers 
												deserted him so he moved to his 
												residence at Nyaniba Estate 
												where he commenced work again in 
												his sitting room. By then, he 
												had started constructing House 
												No. F390/1 with a mortgage loan 
												from Ghana Commercial Bank but 
												because his workers had deserted 
												him and work was at a 
												standstill, he could not honour 
												the payment of the loan, He 
												therefore visited us and 
												requested us to assist him in 
												completing the building, By then 
												the building had been roofed, 
												and wired. We the plaintiffs 
												contributed to its present 
												habitable state. Our 
												contribution was financial. We 
												also acquired the machinery for 
												the failing business. The 
												failing business was solely in 
												our father&#8217;s name but we were 
												working as partners.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As a result of our 
												contributions, our father 
												prepared a document giving we 
												the plaintiffs a share in the 
												property.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The first appellant, in his 
												evidence, merely repeats the 
												averments in the Statement of 
												Claim that he and his sister 
												gave financial assistance to aid 
												their late father in the 
												construction of the building. 
												There is no evidence coming from 
												the appellants' quarters to 
												corroborate the said averments. 
												When he mounted the witness box, 
												it was expected of him to adduce 
												evidence, which would lend 
												credence to the bare assertions 
												and allegations contained in the 
												Statement of Claim. (See the 
												case of Majolagbe v. Larbi &amp; 
												Ors. (1959) G. L. R. (190.) The 
												plaintiffs tendered in evidence 
												a document, exhibit E, which 
												contains an invitation to them 
												dated 4th May 1983, to attend an 
												Executive Meeting with their 
												late father. The agenda of the 
												meeting, which appears at page 
												99 of the record of appeal, 
												includes the following: Review 
												of business operations, 
												Discipline, Finance, Production 
												Control, Staffing and Property. 
												At pages 100 and 101 of the 
												record of appeal, we have what 
												is supposed to be the minutes of 
												that meeting. </span></p>

												&quot;THE BUSINESS PREMISSES - F390/1

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The present business premises 
												was originally planned for 
												residence and construction 
												commenced slowly In 1965. By 
												1972, it had been roofed, wired 
												and slumbered; but financial 
												restraints brought further work 
												to a standstill. When later 
												Michael decided to enter the 
												trade, some of the partitions 
												were removed to create more 
												space suitable for workshops. In 
												1978 work on the building 
												recommenced slowly until the 
												then workshop at Labadi Road 
												suffered the unfortunate fire 
												disaster. Later Adelaide also 
												took interest in the trade and 
												together with Mike they 
												contributed to its present 
												habitable state. It has been 
												agreed by all that the ownership 
												of the building shall be 
												separated from the tailoring 
												business. Share holdlngs as at

												It is worthy of note that from 
												what is reproduced above it is 
												not very clear whether the 
												'shareholdings' quoted above 
												refers to the shares in the 
												business or shares in building. 
												In any case, at page 101 of the 
												record of appeal we have an 
												uncompleted table of &quot;INDIVIDUAL 
												CONTRIBUTIONS&#8221; of the plaintiffs 
												and their late father in respect 
												of the &quot;BUILDING&quot; as well as the 
												&quot;BUSINESS&quot;. In addition, at the 
												top of page 101 of the record of 
												appeal we have a heading&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												&quot;Further proposals' which 
												suggests what we have in exhibit 
												E respecting shares, whether of 
												the building or of the business 
												were mere proposals that could 
												be implemented. In any case, 
												there is nothing in exhibit E to 
												indicate the value of any 
												monetary assistance given by the 
												plaintiffs to their late father 
												for the construction of the 
												house, which is the subject 
												matter of this litigation. 
												According to what we have at 
												page 100 of the record of appeal 
												quoted above the plaintiffs 
												&quot;contributed to its present 
												habitable state&quot;. In exhibit B 
												it appears at page 100 of the 
												record of appeal that &quot;The 
												property shall remain in the 
												name of Emmanuel K. Kwashie. 
												Even if we take the view that 
												the appellants assisted their 
												father with monetary 
												contributions to complete the 
												building we would still have to 
												consider the issue as to whether 
												such financial assistance would 
												make perfect a customary gift. 
												Before we go on further we would 
												have to deal with the issue of 
												customary gift as represented by 
												the second and third grounds of 
												appeal namely: (ii) The learned 
												trial judge erred in law in 
												holding that the gift contained 
												In Exhibit B was a customary 
												gift. (iii) The learned trial 
												judge erred in law in holding 
												that the Testator Emmanuel 
												Kwashie never executed the Deed 
												of Gift.</span></p>

												In his invaluable book, 
												Principles of Customary Land Law 
												in Ghana, (second edition) while 
												he dwelt on subject 'ALIENATION 
												AND TRANSFER' the learned author 
												Nii Amaa Ollennu had this to say 
												at page 127 of the book:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;While on this point it should 
												be emphasised that tenure of all 
												lands in Ghana is regulated by 
												customary law, and any 
												alienation therefore must be in 
												accordance with customary law. 
												Parties to a transaction in 
												respect of land cannot by their 
												contract agree to change the law 
												of the land with respect to a 
												particular subject matter. They 
												may agree that their obligations 
												should be regulated by some law, 
												forming part of the common law 
												of Ghana, other than customary 
												law (that is any law in force in 
												Ghana, other than customary 
												law), but they cannot by the 
												agreement import into their 
												transaction law not in force in 
												Ghana. The only law governing 
												land tenure in Ghana is 
												customary law.&#8221;</span></p>

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Section 4 (1) of the 
												Conveyancing Decree, 1973 
												(N.R.C.D. 175) requires that an

												be in writing as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8221;An oral grant of an interest in

												circumstances permit, 
												incorporating the essential 
												features of the transaction 
												sought to be effected, signed by 
												the person making the transfer 
												or by his agent lawfully 
												authorised for that purpose, and

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												According to Ollennu at page 119 
												of his book, &quot;This did not 
												remove the need to comply with 
												the customary law requisites, 
												but rather added an additional, 
												statutory requite.&#8221;</span></p>

												what was contained in the deed

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

												(iii)&nbsp; the delivery of the land 
												by the donor to the donee.</span></p>

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The making of the gift should 
												have as much publicity as the

												In the judgment of the Land 
												Court in Beatrice N. Asare vrs. 
												Teing &amp; anor. [1960] G. L. R. 
												155 the court summed up the 
												essential.5 of a valid gift as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												'The essentials of a valid gift 
												made in accordance with 
												customary law are: publicity, 
												acceptance, and placing the 
												donee in possession. The way to 
												give publicity to a gift of land 
												is to make the gift in the 
												presence of witnesses, 
												particularly members of the 
												family of the donor who would 
												succeed to the property upon the 
												donor&#8217;s death intestate; and the 
												acceptance must be evidenced by 
												the presentation of 'drink' or 
												some small amount of money to 
												the donor, part of which is 
												served to or shared among the 
												witnesses to the transaction.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Possession is given by taking 
												the donee to the land owners of 
												the adjoining lands having been 
												given previous information to 
												stand on their boundaries and 
												the donee is taken round the 
												said boundaries.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the absence, however, of 
												publicity of the gift at the 
												time of its making,, possession 
												and occupation by the donee and 
												the open exercise of him of 
												rights over the land, which is 
												incapable of any other 
												explanation except that the 
												person in such&nbsp; possession is 
												the owner, will be sufficient 
												evidence and publication, of the 
												gift.'</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												But apart from the drink which 
												the donee should give as an act 
												of acceptance on the occasion 
												when the gift is made to him, he 
												must, within a reasonably short 
												time after the making of the 
												gift, present some articles, a 
												small sum of money and drinks to 
												the donor&#8221;.</span></p>

												In the case of Effuah Kwekuwah 
												v. Effuah Nahenna reported in 
												(1938) 4 W.A.C.A. 165, Effuah 
												Kwekuwah had lived together with 
												Kwamin Assikumah as man and 
												wife. In the course of their 
												marriage, Effuah Kwekuwah 
												rendered monetary and other 
												assistance to her husband as he 
												carried out a building project, 
												which became the subject matter 
												of litigation. In his lifetime, 
												Kwamin Assikumah gave a part of 
												the building to his wife, Effuah 
												Kwekuwah, and the other part to 
												his sister and nieces. After the 
												death of Kwamin Assikumah, in a 
												litigation between Effuah 
												Kwekuwah and the family of her 
												late husband the Native Tribunal 
												ruled that although the late 
												Kwamin Assikumah intended to 
												make a gift of a portion of the 
												house to Effuah Kwekuwah the 
												course adopted by him was 
												improper, since it was 
												&quot;tantamount to private 
												transaction or dealing; gifts of 
												this kind must be made public, 
												that is relatives of both the 
												donor and the donee and some 
												outside persons must be present 
												to act as witnesses, and the 
												donee in accordance with custom 
												acknowledges or accepts the gift 
												by giving some present or 
												presents in return as a thanks 
												giving . . . The gift to the 
												said Effuah Kwekuwah which 
												failed automatically went to the 
												family&quot;. The Court of the 
												Provincial Commissioner, Central 
												Province reversed the decision 
												of the Native Tribunal. On 
												appeal, the West African Court 
												of Appeal held that the findings 
												of the Native Tribunal should 
												not have been disturbed. The 
												appeal before that court was 
												therefore allowed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There is no evidence before on 
												record that exhibit B 
												represented a customary law gift 
												transaction, which has been 
												reduced into writing. All the 
												same, even if we hold the view 
												that exhibit B constituted a 
												valid customary gift, we would 
												have to look at another aspect 
												of the matter, namely whether 
												the testator could devise the 
												house in dispute to Emma Telfah 
												and her children after he had 
												given a portion of it to the 
												plaintiffs before the execution 
												of the will. In other words, 
												could a gift made under 
												customary law be revoked? That 
												issue was adequately addressed 
												in the case of Sese v. Sese 
												(supra). In that case, Abban J. 
												A., (as he then was) had this to 
												say about the incidents of a 
												customary gift which has been 
												reduced in writing, at page 174 
												of the report as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;It may be recalled that the 
												learned judge held in the 
												alternative that assuming there 
												was even a customary gift, that 
												gift was revoked by the will of 
												the plaintiff's late father, 
												exhibit F4. It was this holding 
												that learned counsel for the 
												plaintiff complained about in 
												his last submission.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I think it ought to be made 
												clear that what was contained in 
												the deed of gift, exhibit B, was 
												only the record of transaction 
												appertaining to a customary gift 
												from father to son. That is, a 
												customary gift which had been 
												evidenced in writing. Thus, the 
												mere recording of the gift in 
												writing could not affect its 
												customary nature. It still 
												remained a customary gift and it 
												continued to be subject to the 
												incidents of customary law. Some 
												such Incidents being that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												'Every gift when completed is 
												irrevocable, except in gifts 
												between parent and child, which 
												can be recalled or exchanged at 
												any time by the parent in his or 
												her lifetime, or by his will or 
												dying declaration.'</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												See Sarbah&#8217;s Fanti Customary 
												Laws (3rd ed) at 80-82. In the 
												circumstances, the so-called 
												gift, even if it was valid, 
												could still be revoked by the 
												plaintiff&#8217;s late father by 
												adopting one of the means stated 
												above. The father did not need 
												any special deed of revocation, 
												specially prepared and couched 
												in any strong language as 
												advocated by learned counsel, 
												before the gift could be 
												revoked. So long as the 
												intention to revoke is clearly 
												and unequivocally expressed by 
												the parent, be it orally or in 
												writing or in a will, the 
												revocation would be effective 
												and would be in accord with 
												customary law. The plaintiff&#8217;s 
												late father could Therefore 
												revoke the supposed deed of gift 
												by his will; and in my opinion 
												he effectively did so in clause 
												3 of his will dated 22 July 
												1982.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Consequently, as I have said, 
												even if it had been held that 
												there was an intention to make 
												an absolute customary gift and 
												the transaction which took place 
												between the plaintiff and his 
												late father was a valid 
												customary gift, that gift was 
												effectively and decisively 
												revoked by the father by the 
												said will.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the instant appeal even if we 
												take the view that the late 
												Emmanuel K. Kwashie made a valid 
												gift of a portion of the house 
												in dispute to the appellants in 
												1984 that gift was effectively 
												revoked when on 13th March 1996 
												he devised the same property to 
												Emma Telfah and her children in 
												his Will, exhibit A. For the 
												reasons given in this judgment, 
												the appeal is dismissed.</span></p>
