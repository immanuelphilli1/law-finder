						<span style="font-family: Arial">WOOD, JA:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A notice published in 
						the Gazette No 1 of January 5th 2000, declared the 
						appellant, Samuel Nyimakan the duly elected Member of 
						Parliament (MP) for the Wulensi Constituency in the 
						Northern Region. Following this, the respondent 
						instituted proceedings in the High Court Tamale for a 
						declaration that the appellant was, at the time of his 
						election not qualified to be elected as an MP and 
						consequently that his purported election was void and 
						must be set aside.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The action, which was 
						brought under Article 94(1)(b) of our Constitution and 
						S16 of the Representation of the People Law 1992 PNDCL 
						284 was based on three grounds namely that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(i) &#8220; He was not 
						resident in the Wulensi Constituency, nor had been 
						resident thereat for a total period of five (5) years in 
						the ten (10) years immediately proceeding 7th December 
						2000.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(ii) Nyimakan Samuel 
						does not hail from the Wulensi Constituency&#8221; (par 3 of 
						the petition refers):</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After hearing evidence, 
						the learned trial judge found for the respondent and 
						held that the appellant was not qualified under our 
						electoral laws for election. He accordingly declared his 
						purported election as an MP void. It is against this 
						decision that this instant appeal has been lodged.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I would first deal with 
						the legal ground, which has understandably, been 
						described by the appellant as &#8216;being fundamental to the 
						process of the court&#8221;. It is an additional ground of 
						appeal we nevertheless, on an application brought by the 
						appellant, allowed to be argued viva voce, well after 
						the hearing of this appeal has been conducted and a date 
						set for judgment. It states that: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The procedure adopted 
						in the presentation of the petition was not in 
						conformity with the law governing petitions&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This petition was not 
						commenced by a writ of summons and accompanying 
						statement of claim. The form used, was the English form 
						by which petitions generally and election petitions 
						specifically are presented. It was therefore instituted:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;In the matter of 
						article 99 of the Constitution of Ghana</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">and</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the matter of a 
						Parliamentary election for Wulensi Constituency held on 
						7th December 2000&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the main body of the 
						petition was included the name and address of the 
						petitioner and briefly and in summary form, the material 
						facts on which the petitioner relied.&nbsp; Also included in 
						a footnote are the names of persons required to be 
						served with the petition, it included the appellant, the 
						person who was naturally bound to be affected by the 
						petition. It is this form of presentation which has come 
						under attack.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The argument in support 
						of the legal ground is that the procedural rules 
						governing petitions brought under PNDCL 284 are the 
						rules governing civil causes or matters in the High 
						Court i.e. 1954 Supreme&nbsp; (High) Court (Civil Procedure) 
						Rules LN 140A/1954.&nbsp; It was submitted that the order 2 
						of the rules which deals with the procedure for actions 
						instituted by a writ of summons are the appropriate 
						rules governing election petitions brought under PNDCL 
						284. It was therefore contended that this petition ought 
						to have been commenced by a writ, with the title being 
						in the names of the parties, in this case, the parties 
						to this present appeal, that is to say Fuseini v. Samuel 
						Nyimakan.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The argument 
						consequently was that, since this was not the procedure 
						followed, both the petition and the entire proceedings 
						founded thereon are a complete nullity and the same 
						ought to be set aside in entirety.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We have however, been 
						urged to dismiss this argument outright.&nbsp; The reasons 
						being that, firstly even if as argued, the proper form 
						for presentation was by the issue of a writ, the failure 
						to do so, that is to say, the non compliance of the 
						rules would amount to a mere irregularity clearly 
						incapable of rendering the entire proceedings void, but 
						only voidable. It was further contended that in any 
						case, since this objection has been raised rather 
						belatedly and not within a reasonable time, at a stage 
						when with full knowledge of the irregularity the 
						appellant had fully and actively participated in the 
						hearing of the petition to its logical conclusion, he 
						would be deemed to have waived the alleged irregularity.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Secondly, and more 
						importantly, respondent's counsel justified the use of 
						the English forms on the ground that our own rules are 
						silent on the form in which election petitions should be 
						presented.&nbsp; It was thus submitted that, the only option 
						open to them was by resort to the English forms as has 
						been provided for under order 74 of the High Court 
						Rules.&nbsp; The contention here then, is that the petition 
						as it stood, (in its present form) is in conformity with 
						the rules and perfectly valid.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The article 99(1) (a) 
						of the Constitution, and Sec. 26 (1) of PNDCL 284, the 
						laws under which this petition is brought, provide that:
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Article 99(1) (a) 
						&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1. The validity of an 
						election to Parliament may be questioned only by a 
						petition brought under this part.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2. Every election 
						petition shall be presented before the High Court for 
						hearing.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">S. 26(1) of PNDCL 284 
						stipulates:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The rule of procedure 
						for presentation and hearing of a petition under this 
						Part shall be the same, as the rules of procedure 
						applicable to a civil cause or matter before the high 
						Court.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Procedural rules for 
						presentation, would in my view include the form of the 
						petition itself. Therefore the question raised by this 
						legal ground is: should an election petitions brought 
						under our electoral laws be commenced by a writ of 
						summons with the title setting out the names of the 
						parties as advocated by appellant's counsel or should it 
						take some other form? There are various methods of 
						initiating proceedings in our courts. A petition, 
						separate and distinct from the well-known method of 
						beginning proceedings by a writ of summons, is one of 
						them. It, being the method sanctioned by law for 
						questioning the validity of parliamentary elections, the 
						law would look to that method and that method alone.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The High Court rules 
						have set out the various forms to be used in proceedings 
						brought before it.&nbsp; So for example order 2 rule 3 
						provides: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220; The writ of summons 
						for the commencement of an action shall, except in the 
						case in which any different form is hereinafter 
						provided, be in the forms Nos. 1 and 2 in appendix A 
						Part 1, with such variations as circumstances may 
						require&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">See also order 54 rule 
						4 headed &#8220;form and issue of originating summons.&#8221; </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It states: &#8220; An 
						originating summons shall be in the for No. 2, 3, or 5 
						appendix K to these rules&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The various precedent 
						forms are neatly lined up in the appendixes to the rules 
						book.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the rules do not prescribe that 
						petitions are to take the form of writ of summonses. It 
						is for this reason that I find it incongruous to hold, 
						as had been argued, that election petition shall be in 
						the form prescribed for writs of summonses.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I believe that a brief 
						review of what a petition is, will demonstrate how very 
						distinct it is from a writ and reinforce the point about 
						the legal illogicality that I have&nbsp; pointed out. All&nbsp; 
						the well known authorities are agreed that it is a 
						prayer addressed to the court and not to the other party 
						and also that although no form is prescribed by the 
						rules, the general form is well settled.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In 31&nbsp; Atkins Court 
						Forms 2nd Edition Page 256 Writing under the heading &#8220; 
						Form of Petition&#8221;, the learned author describes a 
						petition as: &#8220;A written document, presented to the 
						court, praying that a particular order be made. Its form 
						is not prescribed.&nbsp; It is addressed to the court and not 
						to the other party &#8230;..</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It must include a 
						concise statement of the nature of the claim made or the 
						relief or remedy required in the proceedings, which it 
						begins but it is not a pleading.&#8221; Also, the author of 
						Atkins Court Forms 2nd Edition in his treatment of the 
						High Court Procedure at page 96 reiterates the same 
						point&nbsp; &#8220;A petition is a document which, whilst 
						containing many of the matters commonly found in 
						pleadings, is not, for the purposes of the rules of 
						Supreme Court to be taken as pleading. No form of 
						petition is prescribed by the rules of the Supreme 
						Court, but the general form is well settled &#8230; It must be 
						entitled in the matter of the company, patent or other 
						matter, or the person, to which the order sought relates 
						and of the Act of Parliament conferring jurisdiction on 
						the court to entertain the petition.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The petition is 
						addressed to Her Majesty&#8217;s High Court of Justice and 
						commences by whom it is presented. Like the other 
						learned authors, Giles Francis Harwood on odgers&#8217; 
						Principles of Pleading and Practice in civil actions in 
						the High Court of Justice 19th Edition states at page 
						355:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The persons who are to 
						be respondents to the Petition and upon whom it will be 
						necessary to serve it are set out in a Footnote&#8221; The 
						same has been provided for under order 52 rules 16 of 
						the High Court Rules. Precedent forms for petitions 
						generally and election petitions specifically, found in 
						Atkins Court Forms Volumes 1 2nd Edition page 180 are 
						all in line with general principles discussed above.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In considering this 
						appeal however, I propose to rely on or be guided by the 
						precedent form for petitions generally, and which may be 
						found at page 166 of Atkins Court Forms 2nd Edition, and 
						not the form for elections specifically, for the simple 
						reason that although they are similar, the forms for 
						petitions under the latter, have been prescribed for the 
						particular purpose of questioning elections, by their 
						existing rules i.e. The Election Petition Rules 1960 No 
						543.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this regard, I am in 
						agreement with the respondent's counsel that because of 
						the absence of specific rules on the form of the 
						petition, we may have resort to order 74 of the rules, 
						which stipulate that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Where no provision is 
						made by these rules the Procedure, practice and forms in 
						England, shall, so far as they can be conveniently 
						applied, be in force&#8221;&#8230;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">To this extent, it is 
						plain that the petition is in its proper form and 
						altogether valid.&nbsp; But assuming I am in error and indeed 
						this petition ought to have been presented in the form 
						of a writ of summons, reasons advocated by the 
						respondent's counsel impels me to dismiss appellant's 
						counsel's argument. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Order 70 of the rules 
						would reduce the non-compliance complained of the type 
						described as a mere irregularity incapable of rendering 
						the petition and the proceedings founded thereon void.&nbsp; 
						In other words that default is, as was done by the 
						appellant in this case, capable of being waived.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The age-old case of 
						Mosi v Bagyina (1963) GLR 337 at 347,draws a clear 
						distinction between the non-compliance which amounts to 
						a mere irregularity capable of being waived, as opposed 
						to those which because it is clearly unwarranted by any 
						rule of law or procedure renders the entire proceedings 
						void.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The court held that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The provisions of 
						order 70 apply to such irregularity as does not render 
						void any proceedings based thereon such an irregularity 
						is only voidable and may be waived, an application to 
						set it aside must be made within a reasonable time&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Given that equity looks 
						at the substance rather the form and the fact also that 
						appellant with full knowledge of the irregularity 
						actively participated in the hearing, and did not raise 
						this matter promptly but belatedly coupled also with the 
						fact that he has not also demonstrated he has suffered 
						any miscarriage of justice, I would dismiss this ground 
						of appeal as being unmeritorious.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A number of arguments 
						were advanced in support of the other two grounds of 
						appeal namely:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) The judgment is 
						against the weight of evidence </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) The learned High 
						Court Judge's decision that the respondent does not, 
						hail from Kumboni in the Wulensi Constituency is not 
						supported by the evidence&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Ground (b)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In determining the 
						question of where the appellant hailed from, the trial 
						judge first had to determine the meaning of the word 
						&#8220;hail from&#8221; His conclusion was that for the purposes of 
						our electoral laws the expression&nbsp; &#8220;hailing from&#8221; 
						carries the same meaning as &#8220;home Town.&#8221; Evidently, 
						appellant's counsel has no quarrel with this line of 
						reasoning, which incidentally, falls in line with the 
						dictionary meaning of the expression, i.e. &#8220;originate 
						from&#8221;. The first of his complaints however is that, the 
						trial judge, in spite of the ample evidence on the 
						record, held that neither the appellant nor his mother 
						DW3, spoke of where he was born or hails from.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The second was that he 
						drew wrong inferences from the appellant's failure to 
						invite the court to move to Saboba to take evidence from 
						his ailing father.&nbsp; The third was that the trial judge 
						yet again wrongly concluded, in spite of the over 
						whelming evidence, that appellant did not challenge the 
						respondent's assertion that he did not hail from the 
						constituency but from Saboba.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I agree with 
						appellant's counsel that both the DW3 as well as the 
						appellant did give evidence on where the latter was born 
						or hails from.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Again, for reasons that 
						I would state shortly in the judgment, the inference 
						drawn from the failure by appellant to expressly 
						challenge the respondent's evidence that he did not hail 
						from the constituency, is on the particular facts of 
						this case in error.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Be that as it may, the 
						presence of these errors do minimal damage to his case 
						and, even if they are corrected and the proper findings 
						are made and the proper inferences are drawn in favour 
						of the appellant, there will still be evidence on the 
						record, sufficiently strong enough to support the 
						critical finding that he did not hail from the 
						constituency and was therefore, on that score, at the 
						date of this election, ineligible.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">But perhaps, the more 
						substantial point urged was that the trial judge placed 
						undue reliance on the Exh. C, D, E, F, G, H, and K. 
						Counsel contended that those Exhibits are hearsay 
						evidence. Further that when the respondent made those 
						vital declarations concerning his hometown and or his 
						birthplace, he did so as a child who was merely putting 
						down facts as handed down to him by someone who may well 
						have been&nbsp; mistaken about these facts.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was urged that under 
						these circumstances, the oral testimony of the 
						appellant's mother and others on the crucial issue of 
						where he hailed from was more reliable than the Exhibits 
						which the trial judge relied on to rule against him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">With the exception of 
						exhibits H, these documents are forms filled in by 
						either the appellant himself or by school authorities 
						(or officials) with information supplied by him or his 
						parent or guardian. These events occurred at different 
						stages in his life when he sought admission to 
						educational institutions in this country and, in one 
						instance when he was actually in enrollment as a pupil. 
						The Exh. H is a voter registration form filled in by an 
						official of the Electoral Commission, obviously or 
						better still, presumably with information supplied by 
						him. Significantly, on all those occasions, with the 
						exception of Exh. &quot;C&quot; and F he identified Saboba as his 
						hometown. Indeed, not even once, did he state that he 
						originated from Kumboni or for that matter any other 
						place in the Wulensi Constituency. In both Exh. C and F, 
						Saboba is again described as his permanent postal or 
						home address. In adulthood, he stuck to the same facts. 
						Thus, at age 20, when seeking admission into Dagamba 
						Training College, in 1995, when he applied to be 
						registered as a voter at a time he was aged 33 years, 
						and finally in 1997 when he sought entry into the 
						University as a mature student, the story was the same.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Surprisingly, it was 
						only recently, when he sought political office (when the 
						fact that a candidate must hail from the constituency 
						became a necessary criterion) that he varied this aspect 
						of his family history. Therefore, in September 2000 for 
						the first time in his lifetime, when completing his 
						Parliamentary nomination Papers, he declared Kumboni as 
						his hometown and birthplace. Kumboni, the evidence 
						discloses, falls in the Constituency.&nbsp; Therefore 
						counsel's contention that he filled in those forms, as a 
						child is not supported by the record. We do not have any 
						evidence from him to that effect and the record cannot 
						therefore uphold any such finding.&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the 
						particulars in Exh. C, the record filled in by the 
						school authorities when he first entered the Primary 
						school, the probabilities are that the particulars 
						therein were supplied by another Nyimakan who would then 
						be his guardian.&nbsp; The more pertinent point is that 
						Saboba is stated therein as the address of that parent 
						or guardian. By the time he came in to fill the Exh. K, 
						he was a very well educated gentleman, a teacher who has 
						gone through training college and was seeking entry into 
						one of the highest institutions of learning in this 
						country. Any claims that the information given in those 
						declarations are unintentional errors would receive due 
						recognition and possibly acceptance only if they came 
						from him.&nbsp; However, looking through his evidence we find 
						that he made no effort to explain what brought about the 
						marked inconsistency in the two sets of declarations, 
						the exhibits C, D, E, F, G, H, and K on the one hand and 
						Exh. J on the other.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The closest to any such 
						attempt is what he deposed to as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;When I completed the 
						University, then I decided to set my records correct to 
						reflect on where my father was born&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">First, this evidence is 
						false. It was when he sought political office that he 
						thought of &#8220;setting the records straight&#8221;, not when he 
						left the university.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Even so, this evidence 
						was clearly not supported by any independent testimony, 
						documentary or oral, thus leading to the conclusion that 
						truly it was when he sought to enter parliament that he 
						identified Kumboni as his hometown. But even more 
						importantly, the evidence led does not amount to an 
						explanation, let alone a satisfactory one as to why he 
						made those previous contradictory declarations.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The criticism that the 
						trial judge placed under weight on the exhibits is 
						clearly unjustified. In the first place, the statements 
						contained in them are by virtue of s.128 (1) of the 
						Evidence decree NRCD 323, and contrary to appellant's 
						counsel's argument, clearly admissible. Under this rule, 
						statements by a declarant concerning his pedigree 
						provided they were made before the controversy arose 
						over the fact of family history, does constitute one of 
						the exceptions to the hearsay rule.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The S.128 stipulates:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Evidence of a hearsay 
						statement by a declarant concerning his own birth, or 
						marriage, divorce, relationship by blood, marriage or 
						adoption ancestry or other similar fact of his family 
						history is not made inadmissible by S. 117 and will not 
						be made inadmissible by the fact that the declarant had 
						no means of acquiring personal knowledge of the matter 
						declared if the statement was made before controversy 
						arose over the fact of family history&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is upon this basis 
						that the court held that &#8220;Until this nomination for 
						election, the respondent had never given any place 
						within the Wulensi Constituency as his home town.&nbsp; In 
						the face of these strong pieces of evidence as it were 
						many admissions, the respondent sought to give evidence 
						to explain by what he wrote in the documents.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel for the 
						petitioner quite rightly raised an objection that oral 
						evidence is not admissible to interpret written 
						documents, especially when there is no ambiguity.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In view of the 
						sensitive nature of the case and the fact that a right 
						of a very high profile member of the society was at 
						stake, I allowed the respondent to give evidence 
						indicating to him that what mattered was the weight to 
						be placed on the evidence given&#8230;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">With mass of evidence 
						from the Petitioner which included many admissions, by 
						the respondent of the fact that he hails from Saboba, I 
						felt compelled to find and I so find that the respondent 
						did not hail from the Wulensi Constituency&#8221; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I must confess that I 
						find some part of the reasoning, particularly on the 
						issue of the explanation offered and the issue of the 
						construction of the document hard to follow. But I do 
						not think that the final conclusion, namely that the 
						mass of evidence supports the finding that he does not 
						hail from the constituency, can be faulted.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As against the 
						respondent testimony that he did not hail from the 
						constituency and which was supported by all these 
						documents, we have the evidence of the appellant 
						consisting wholly of his oral testimony and that of his 
						relations, persons, who like the parties have a vested 
						interest in the outcome of this case. Understandably, he 
						also relied on the declaration in exhibit &quot;J&quot; as proof 
						of his counter assertion that he hails from Kumboni and 
						not Saboba, a fact the trial judge validly in my view, 
						rejected.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">An evaluation of the 
						evidence led on both sides of this legal divide led him 
						to place maximum weight on these documents and to 
						roundly reject the story about Kumboni, for the other 
						reason also that it is not shown on a topographical map 
						of the area made in 1961.&nbsp; Indeed, if the appellant&#8217;s 
						hometown were Kumboni why did he have to wait until it 
						became a condition precedent to seeking political office 
						before saying so?&nbsp; In any event, the fact that the 
						Kumboni story came up while filling in this Exh. J does 
						not tally with the impression he created that it was 
						after he completed university that out of his own good 
						sense, he set out to correct that anomaly.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the case that the 
						trial judge was met, with the documentary evidence 
						became the safest and most reliable indicator of the 
						truth and the court as, already stated was justified in 
						placing the weight it did on the documents and rejecting 
						the appellant&#8217;s case on the basis that it lacked 
						credibility. This court speaking with one voice in the 
						case of Asia v. Ayevudu and Anor. [1987-88]1GLR 177 
						outlined the principle under which a prior inconsistent 
						statement can have a negative impact on a witnesses 
						credibility on a particular issue.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was held that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Under the principle of 
						prior self contradiction, a prior inconsistent 
						statement, if not satisfactorily explained as to the 
						circumstances under which it was made under duress or 
						mistake would go to impeach credit on that particular 
						fact.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is plain however 
						that the said explanation must come from the declarant 
						himself.&nbsp; Admittedly, it (the explanation) may be 
						corroborated by the evidence of another witness, but it 
						is quite clear that it is the maker of the statement who 
						owes the court an explanation. On this basis, 
						appellant's counsel's proposition that DW2 offered a 
						credible explanation on behalf of the appellant as to 
						why he had all along described Saboba as his hometown 
						has no basis in law; for the declarant himself offered 
						none. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The undoubted principle 
						of law is that in civil trials, although the burden of 
						proof lay on the one who must succeed in the action, it 
						shifted in the course of the trial (See in Re Krah 
						Deceased Yan Kyeraaha and Others v Osei tutu and Anor 
						1989-90 GLR 638. On the issue of where he hailed from 
						the appellant failed to discharge the evidentiary burden 
						which shifted on him after the respondent had discharged 
						the initial burden placed on him, by establishing a 
						prima facie case. Again the circumstances under which an 
						appellate court may interfere with the findings of fact 
						of a trial court and the inferences and conclusions 
						drawn there from have long been established.&nbsp; These two 
						cases:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1. Praka v Ketewa 1964 
						GLR 423 at 426 where the following opinion was expressed 
						&#8220;An appeal is by way of rehearing and so an appellate 
						court is entitled to make up its own mind on the facts 
						and to draw inferences from them to the extent that the 
						trial court could. Where however, the decision depends 
						on the credibility of witnesses, the appeal court ought 
						not to interfere with findings of fact except where they 
						were shown to be wrong or where these facts were wrong 
						inferences drawn from admitted facts or facts found by 
						the trial court&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Yakubu II v Abdulai 
						1984-86 GLR 241 also summed up the principle as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;An appellate court 
						could set aside a finding of fact if there was no 
						evidence in support or that the preponderance of 
						evidence weighs heavily against the finding or that 
						inferences from the findings were wrong.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Applying these 
						principles to this instant appeal, I would have no 
						justification in disturbing the findings made nor 
						inferences drawn and the conclusion reached on the key 
						issue of where the appellant hailed from. The appeal on 
						this ground must fail.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Additionally, the trial 
						judge upheld the claim that appellant was unqualified 
						also in terms of the residential requirement imposed by 
						Article 94(1)(b) of the Constitution. This finding has 
						again been challenged on the grounds that it is against 
						the weight of evidence. One of the arguments in support 
						of this ground is that the trial judge erred in limiting 
						himself to only one ambit of that requirement, so that 
						the moment he ruled on one, he failed to consider 
						whether he nevertheless qualified under the second.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The article 94(1)(b) of 
						the Constitution, and which provision is repeated in 
						S.9(1)(b) of PNDCL 284 provides as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Subject to the 
						provisions of this article, a person shall not be 
						qualified to be a member of Parliament, unless he is 
						resident in the Constituency for which he stands as a 
						candidate for election or he has resided there for a 
						total period of not less than five years out of the ten 
						years immediately preceding the elections for which he 
						stands, or he hails from that constituency.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">One of the flaws about 
						this case is that it proceeded to trial without the 
						appellant filling an answer to the petition. It was thus 
						impossible at the on set to know which of the 
						qualifications: if any, he fell short of. It followed 
						that all the material facts upon which the petition was 
						founded was put in issue. Put in other words, the 
						respondent had to prove also that he satisfied none of 
						the requirement under residence.&nbsp; I am however of the 
						opinion that it would be uncharitable to say that the 
						judge failed to appreciate that the claim under 
						residential requirement fell into two distinct parts and 
						further that they needed separate consideration. On the, 
						in considering the task facing him he said: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Article 94(1)(b) sets 
						out three situations for qualification to stand as a 
						candidate in a Constituency: - namely general residence, 
						residence for five out of ten years immediately 
						preceding the election and hailing from the 
						constituency. A candidate is qualified to stand for 
						election if he can satisfy any one of these situations. 
						In the course of this case, the respondent did not file 
						any paper, which shows which of the three situations he 
						relied on as his qualification to stand as a candidate 
						for Wulensi Constituency. I will therefore have to 
						examine all three situations in relation to the 
						respondent&quot; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Again, the position the 
						trial judge took was that from the evidence the 
						appellant was not relying on the Residence criteria, but 
						on the fact that he hailed from the Constituency. His 
						view therefore was that there was &quot;no live issue&quot; 
						concerning residence. He nevertheless proceeded a step 
						further and considered the &quot;five year residential&quot; 
						question but then ruled that even on that, the evidence 
						pointed to the contrary,</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1) That he does not 
						reside in the constituency, and indeed, </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) That appellant had 
						never in the whole of his lifetime lived in the 
						Constituency. He therefore reasoned that this proved 
						that fact leads to the irresistible conclusion that he 
						had also not been resident there for a total of five 
						years out of the ten immediately years preceding the 
						elections.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">While I agree with the 
						appellant counsel that the burden lay on the respondent 
						to prove that he did not satisfy any of the residential 
						requirements, I am satisfied that he discharged the 
						burden.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He deposed to the fact 
						that apart from the campaign period, the appellant has 
						never lived in the constituency. Furthermore under 
						cross-examination he testified that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;He taught at Dakpam 
						Primary in Bimbila Constituency from 1985 upwards. He 
						left Dakpam in 1993. These are the areas I know he 
						stayed. Even he stayed in Nanumba District it was in the 
						Bimbila Constituency, but not in Wulensi Constituency.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Of course, appellant 
						also gave an account of where he had lived since 1985. 
						From his version he had most times continued to reside 
						in his village Kumboni since it has always turned out to 
						be close to schools he has been posted to. At the date 
						of Exhibit &quot;J&quot; the declaration was that he lived at 
						Lugui.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">With the respondents 
						prima facie evidence establishing that </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) His hometown is 
						Saboba;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) He has never in his 
						lifetime lived in Kumboni or for that matter any other 
						place within the constituency and therefore that he did 
						not meet any of the requirements under residence,</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">the evidential burden 
						shifted on to him to lead evidence in disproof of these 
						facts asserted. Plainly, facts related to his 
						residential qualifications are all matters peculiarly 
						within his knowledge. The law would thus require that he 
						led credible evidence in proof of them. On the facts of 
						this case, it must go beyond merely mounting the witness 
						box and listing places in the constituency where he had 
						lived, also because on his own showing, the schools he 
						had taught in are all located outside the constituency. 
						That approach, would in my respectful view, offend the 
						principle enunciated in the well known case of Majolagbe 
						v Larbi 1958 GLR 490, which principle has been fully 
						endorsed in Zamabra&nbsp; v Segbedzia&nbsp; 1991 2GLR 221.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">That kind of evidence 
						if led, would not constitute sufficient proof in law. 
						Unfortunately, that is exactly what he did. He produced 
						no corroborative evidence in proof of these essential 
						facts:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1) That he was 
						resident in the constituency and or</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) That he had lived 
						in his home village Kumboni for a total period of not 
						less than five years out of the ten years immediately 
						preceding the elections since 1985 and had when resided 
						there as he was posted to these other places outside the 
						constituency.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Is it the case that he 
						could not find one single person who lived in that 
						village for these number of years to come and testify on 
						his behalf? What of the teachers he worked with in the 
						various schools? Contrary to his counsel&#8217;s proposition, 
						he is the one who must be accused of making &quot;bald 
						assertions&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In any event, I have 
						already demonstrated that the court found and the same 
						is supported by the record, that he hails from Saboba 
						not Kumboni. His home village therefore could not have 
						been Kumboni, thus making his story about how and why he 
						had since 1985 continued to live in Kumboni, on the 
						balance, improbable if not a complete falsehood. The 
						evidence on the record weighs heavily against him on the 
						issue of residential qualification as well.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Finally, I think the 
						trial judge was right in concluding that if any he never 
						relied on the residence requirement. On exhibit &#8220;J&#8221; he 
						expressly indicated that, that requirement was 
						inapplicable to him. Inapplicable means that it is not 
						relevant or cannot be applied to his situation. The 
						trial judge rightly held him bound by that record. While 
						I agree with applicant counsel that this declaration per 
						se does not absolve the court from determining in the 
						action, whether or not he was in fact unqualified under 
						the residential requirement, the legal position is that 
						the absence of any satisfactory explanation from him 
						(not from his counsel in argument) as to why he made 
						that previous contradictory declaration, would clearly 
						weigh against his case. And the truth is that he himself 
						offered no explanation on this matter. Indeed the 
						&quot;residential requirement&quot; is the first and second 
						criteria listed on the form. If he were indeed qualified 
						under either or both of them, why did he not bring 
						himself under them but choose the third - the &quot;hail 
						from&quot; criteria. If he chose the third because he found 
						or thought that more attractive and more likely to earn 
						him the much-needed votes, then it was his duty to 
						explain that to the court, but he did not. Since the 
						question of whether or not he satisfied the residential 
						requirement turned on the issue credibility and the 
						court for good reasons rejected his claim we cannot 
						upset the findings correctly made and inferences 
						properly drawn. Before coming to this conclusion, I have 
						adverted my mind to another criticism levelled against 
						the trial judge. It is this that he misdirected himself 
						by taking the rather hard position that because the 
						appellant failed to cross-examine the respondent&#8217;s 
						evidence in chief that he did not reside in the 
						constituency, he is deemed to have admitted the fact.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Mantey v Botwe 1989 GLR 
						479 cautions against a strict application of the general 
						rule that failure to cross-examine a witness on a 
						material fact given on oath amounts to its admission. 
						Occasions on which a strict application would work 
						manifest injustice was held to include: &quot;If a person 
						total response in the witness box added up to a 
						clear-dermal of what his opponent had alleged either 
						against him or to bolster up his case.&quot; I would extend 
						the rate exception to cover situations where both 
						parties are in breach of the rule. It would be unjust to 
						apply the rule against one party to the exclusion of the 
						other. I find in this case that not only does the 
						appellants total response an outright rejection of the 
						respondents claim, but indeed both sides on occasions 
						failed to go through the mechanical motions of denying 
						assertions made on oath against them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Ground (c).&nbsp; </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In respect of the above 
						ground learned counsel for Mr. Samuel Nyimakan who will 
						henceforth be referred to as the respondent/appellant 
						attacked the title of the case saying it was irregular 
						as it did not disclose the names of the parties and was 
						at variance with S.26 of PNDC law 284 the Representation 
						of the people law which provides that the rules of 
						procedure applicable to election petitions shall be the 
						same as those applicable to civil cases and matters 
						before the High Court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He concluded by saying 
						the procedure adopted by the petitioner &#8211; respondent was 
						not in conformity with the law of Ghana and should be so 
						declared.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In reply learned 
						counsel for the petitioner respondent said the attack 
						was baseless since on knowing of the alleged 
						irregularity the appellant-respondent did nothing in the 
						court below and allowed the petition to travel its whole 
						length until it was heard and judgment given. Further it 
						was said that the High Court rules make provision for 
						petitions to be brought the way the 
						petitioner-respondent did.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">My view of the matter 
						is that by taking steps to examine the 
						petitioner-respondent and his witnesses and also by 
						putting in the appellant-respondent and his witnesses to 
						testify and be examined without raising the objection 
						which he now raises in ground (c), the appellant was 
						caught by ORDER 70 Rule 2 of LN 140 A of 1954 &#8211; the High 
						Court Civil Procedure Rules which provides that :&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;a reasonable time nor 
						if the party applying has</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&quot;taken any fresh step 
						after knowing of the irregularity.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Further ORDER 74 OF 
						L.N. 140A of 1954 provides:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;where no provision is

						Court of the Gold Coast.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In our case, learned 
						counsel for the petitioner-respondent has adequately and 
						satisfactorily demonstrated that he complied wish 0.74 
						above and that he followed the direction in ATKINS COURT 
						FORMS &#8211; 2ND EDITION VOL. 128 </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the result I 
						consider the objection raised in ground (c) to be 
						improper and I dismiss same.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Grounds (a) and (b) 
						These deal with the contention that the judgment from 
						the court below is against the weight of evidence and 
						also that the learned trial judge erred when he held 
						that the Appellant-Respondent does not &quot;hail from&quot; 
						KUMBONI.&nbsp; There two grounds shall be taken together.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It should be observed 
						that prior to the conclusion which the learned trial 
						judge came to the petitioner-respondent had given 
						evidence and had been examined by the 
						appellant-respondent&#8217;s counsel who had also called 
						witnesses and these had been examined.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the part of the 
						Appellant-Respondent he had also testified and had been 
						examined and had called witnesses who had equally been 
						examined.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The case for the 
						Petitioner-Respondent is that the Appellant Respondent 
						was not living and had never lived in the Wulensi 
						Parliamentary Constituency. He the respondent &quot;hailed 
						from&quot; Saboba which was in Bimbila Constituency and was 
						thus not qualified to represent the people of Wulensi 
						Constituency as S.9(b) of PNDC Law 284 requires.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defence of 
						Appellant-Respondent does not deny that between the time 
						he was a school boy in Primary School through Secondary 
						School, Teacher Training College to the University he 
						had made documents in which his home town was stated as 
						Saboba but he claims at the time of the Parliamentary 
						Elections in the year 2000 he was &quot;hailing from&quot; 
						Kumboni. In the words of Appellant-Respondent at page 54 
						of the Record (lines 8 and 9) he says: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;In my juvenile records 
						Saboba was recorded as my </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						birth.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(Then in line 24 
						following he continues and says)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;When I completed the 
						University then I decided to set</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(he continues at p.54 
						lines 51 following as follows)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;This reminds me of an 
						incident in 1992 when I </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;wanted to file my
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;I did not come from 
						Wulensi but from Saboba&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">During crossed examine 
						the Appellant-Respondent was given a topographical map 
						of Wulensi constituency prepared in 1969 by the survey 
						Department and was asked to point to Kumboni but he 
						could not. He was told he did not hail from Wulensi 
						constituency but he replied he came from there.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I now purpose to 
						examine the operative part of S.9 (1)(b) of PNDC Law 284 
						and to comment on same.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It provides:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;A person shall not be 
						qualified to be a candidate for the </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;office of member of 
						Parliament unless </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(b) he is resident in 
						the constituency for which he stands&#8230;..</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;OR has resided there 
						for a total period of not less than </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;5 years out of the 10 
						years immediately preceding the election for which he 
						stand.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Or he 'hails from' that 
						constituency&quot; (the emphasis is mine)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The legislature has 
						provided for 3 categories of persons who qualify to 
						stand to be elected and it is up to a candidate to bring 
						himself under any one of these categories. This accounts 
						for the use of the word &#8220;or&#8221; in the provision quoted 
						above.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In our case, the 
						question to be asked is under which of the 3 categories 
						did the Appellant-Respondent bring himself? The answer 
						seems to be that the Appellant Respondent chose the 3rd 
						category for he made a statutory declaration at p.88 of 
						the record that he &quot;hailed from&quot;.&nbsp; THE WULENSI 
						CONSTITUENCY.&nbsp;&nbsp; (see Exhibit &quot;J&quot;)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The next question which 
						flows from the above is what is meant by the expression 
						&quot;hail from&quot;. It is to be observe that this is not 
						defined by the statute but both counsel for the 
						Petition-Respondent and the Appellant-Respondent seem to 
						agree that the term is synonymous with &quot;home town&quot; in 
						our local parlance. It is also said that in Ghana as 
						soon as a person is born and in consonance with 
						customary law of the locality whether it is matrilineal 
						or patrilineal, a newly-born person will automatically 
						&quot;hail from&quot; a particular place/town &#8211; which does not 
						change.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As the term 'hail from' 
						is not defined by statute what should be the judicial 
						approach towards its construction?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">S 19(1) of the 
						Interpretation Act, 1960 &#8211; C.A. 4 provides:&nbsp;&nbsp; (inter 
						alia)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;for the purpose of 
						ascertaining the mischief and defect which </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&quot;an enactment was made 
						to cure and as an aid to the </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&quot;construction of the 
						enactment a court may have regard to</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&quot;any text book or 
						other work of reference . . . .&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Since the case herein 
						was adjourned for judgment I have been combing and 
						looking up several dictionaries to see whether I can get 
						any help or meaning of the term &quot;hail from&quot;. Luckily I 
						have come by PUNK and WAGNALL&#8217;S Standard Dictionary 
						(International Edition) Vol. One (1968) which defines 
						&#8220;hail from&#8221; as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(i) to come from</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(ii) have as one&#8217;s 
						original home or</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(iii) have as one&#8217;s 
						original residence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It seems to me 
						therefore that when the expression &quot;hail from&quot; is used 
						in S.901(b) of PNDCL. 284 The Representation of the 
						people law, 1992 it can only mean the original home/town 
						of a candidate in the consistency (if he has one). In 
						our case the Appellant-Respondent from the record has 
						laid claim to both Saboba and Kumboni as being towns 
						where he &#8220;hails from&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The next question is 
						can a parliamentary candidate &quot;hail from&quot; two different 
						palaces in two different constituencies for purposes of 
						our parliamentary election. This question reminds me of 
						Robert Louis Stevenson&#8217;s book entitled THE STRANGE CASE 
						OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR HYDE - a book that tells a tale of 
						dual personality.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The answer to my last 
						question appears to be in the negative for if the 
						expression &quot;hail from&quot; means &quot;the original home or 
						residence of a person&quot;.&nbsp; Then it can only be one.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In conclusion it may be 
						asked which of the two towns &quot;Saboba&quot; and &quot;kumboni&quot; 
						should, from the record, be accepted as where the 
						Appellant-Respondent &quot;hails from&quot;?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is my considered 
						view that the Appellant-Respondent must be taken to hail 
						from Saboba which is outside Wulensi Constituency. For 
						the following reasons:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">a) From Primary class 
						one in 1970 through secondary school, Teacher Training 
						College to University the Appellant-Respondent referred 
						to SABOBA in all the documents tendered as his hometown 
						and place of birth. This was at a period When a 
						Parliamentary Election involving the Appellant was not 
						looming or pending.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">b) During the 
						cross-examination of the Petitioner by two different 
						counsel for the Appellant-Respondent nowhere in the 
						proceedings was it ever suggested to the 
						Petitioner-Respondent that Mr. Samuel Nyimakan the 
						Appellant-Respondent &#8220;hails from&#8221; KUMBONI and not 
						SABOBA.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">CROSS-ON EVIDENCE &#8211;(2ND 
						EDITION &#8211; 1963) at p.215 observes on this kind of 
						situation as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Any matter upon which 
						it is proposed to contradict the evidence in chief given 
						by the witness must normally be put to him so that he 
						may have an opportunity of explaining the contradiction 
						and failure to do this may be held to imply acceptance 
						of the evidence-in-chief.&quot;</span></p>

						(1863) 6.R67. and R. v. HART(1932) 23 Cr. App. R202.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In conclusion, it is my 
						considered view therefore that Aninakwa J in the court 
						below was right when he found that the 
						Appellant-Respondent was at the time of the 7th December 
						2000 Parliamentary Election not qualified to be a 
						candidate and that his purported election was void. I 
						uphold and affirm the decision of the court below and 
						dismiss the present appeal which has failed.</span></p>
