						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is an appeal from 
						the judgment of the High Court, Sekondi; delivered on 4 
						April 2001. I intend to make references to the parties 
						as they were at the trial court.&nbsp; The plaintiff by name 
						Yaa Kwasi sued Arhin Davis as 1st defendant jointly with 
						Nortey as 2nd defendant for a declaration of title to a 
						certain piece of land and other ancillary reliefs. The 
						1st defendant, asserting his right to the ownership of 
						the land had leased a portion of it to the 2nd defendant 
						for consideration. As soon as this transaction came to 
						the notice of the plaintiff, he spared no time to 
						institute the legal action against the two defendants 
						claiming that the land was his bona fide property and 
						the defendants had wrongfully trespassed upon it. The 
						plaintiff sued in the capacity of the Head of Basia 
						Aryah&#8217;s branch of the Ebiradze Family of Anagye, a 
						suburb of Sekondi and he described the land as a large 
						part and parcel of land situate at Anagye and bounded by 
						the lands of Ebiradze Family of Fijai, Nsona Family of 
						Anagye, then Norwen&#8217;s&nbsp; Ebiradze Family of Anagye (see 
						the indorsement on the Writ of Summons and paragraph 2 
						of the Statement of Claim). The plaintiff contented by 
						his pleadings that his family had been owners of the 
						land from time immemorial and had exercised various acts 
						of ownership including grants of portions of the land to 
						non-family members. The plaintiff, butterweed his case 
						by a plea of estoppel per rem judicatam by averring that 
						in an arbitration before the Omanhene of the Ahanta 
						Traditional Area he was adjudged owner of the land as 
						against the 1st defendant. The case of the 1st defendant 
						for the other part was that his grandfather by the name 
						L.T.C, Davis, a Sierra Leonean who was domiciled in 
						Ghana and lived in Sekondi purchased the disputed land 
						from the plaintiff&#8217;s ancestress called Arabah Ayah at an 
						auction sale and that the property had devolved upon him 
						by way of inheritance, that since the said purchase his 
						family had exercised acts of ownership over the land.&nbsp; 
						In his reply filed on the 2 October 1992, the plaintiff 
						denied the averments in the statement of defence and 
						joined issue on all est I forget, I should mention that 
						the 1st defendant denied that there was a proper 
						arbitration, although he admitted that the plaintiff 
						lodged a complaint before the Omanhene of the Ahanta 
						Traditional Area. But the main case put up by the 1st 
						defendant was that the plaintiff was caught by estoppel 
						per rem judicatam. The 1st defendant&#8217;s plea was that he 
						could rely for the success of his plea of estoppel upon 
						a judgment given in favour of his predecessors as 
						against the predecessor of the&nbsp; plaintiff in respect of 
						the disputed land. The case he averred to in paragraph 6 
						of his statement of Defence was a judgment of the 
						Supreme Court of the Gold Coast.&nbsp; Western Province, 
						Seconded held before His Worship H.C.W Grimshaw Esq., on 
						the 10th December 1912, in Re LTC Davis Appellant vrs. 
						Norweh-Respondent, Appeal from the decision of the 
						Native Tribunal of Dutch Sekondi. In particular the most 
						important case put up by the 1st defendant was that in 
						that lawsuit the said Baya Ayah, the ancestress of the 
						Plaintiff, gave evidence to the effect that she had sold 
						the land in dispute to a predecessor of the 1st 
						defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The judgment pleaded by 
						the 1st defendant did not therefore purport to establish 
						only a cause of action estoppel, but also an issue 
						estoppel because the statement attributed to Baya Ayah, 
						if proved, constituted admissible hearsay, a statement 
						made against proprietary interest recognised and as an 
						exception to the hearsay rule under section 117 &#8211; 118 of 
						the Evidence Decree 1975 (NRCD 373).&nbsp; Such admissions 
						made by predecessors bind their descendants or those who 
						claim through them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After pleadings had 
						closed and the trial had advanced to the stage where the 
						plaintiff had closed his case, Ebusuapanin Kwamina Badu 
						applied to the court to permit him join as a party. In a 
						motion paper filed on the 8 October 1993, the applicant 
						prayed that he be joined as co-plaintiff. He deposed to 
						an affidavit in support of the motion that he was the 
						Head of Family of the Ntankorful branch of the Royal 
						Abrashiem Ebiradze family, owners of all Ntankorful 
						land. He deposed further that it had come to his notice 
						that a land dispute which covered part of Ntankorful 
						lands had arisen before the Court and he felt compelled 
						to join the suit. In paragraph 4 of his&nbsp; affidavit he 
						deposed to the fact that he had never made any grant of 
						any Ntankorful land to either the plaintiff or the 
						defendants. The trial judge granted the application but 
						the applicant became the 3rd defendant rather than 
						co-plaintiff. By paragraph 3 of a Statement of Defence 
						filed on his behalf the 3rd defendant claimed that the 
						land referred to by the plaintiff in paragraph 2 of the 
						Statement of Claim belonged not to Basia Ayah&#8217;s family 
						by to the Abrashiem Ebiradze family of which he was the 
						head.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 3rd defendant 
						averred the following in paragraph 4 of his Statement of 
						Defence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;(4) The 3rd defendant 
						avers that there are other judgments which estopp the 
						defendants such as inter alia Ltd Davis vrs. Norweh&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is interesting to 
						observe that during the trial, the 3rd defendant or 
						co-defendant as his counsel called him traced his root 
						of title to Basia Araba Ayah just as the plaintiff did. 
						A saying goes like this: &#8220;When two elephants fight in a 
						grassland it is the grass which suffers&#8221;. True, but in 
						the area of land litigation the contrary is true in the 
						sense that when two members of a family fight over a 
						portion of their family land, any purchaser of such land 
						has nothing to suffer from, provided he can prove the 
						purchase to the satisfaction of the Court. Predictably 
						enough, the trial Judge entered judgment for the 1st and 
						2nd defendants and dismissed the claims of the plaintiff 
						and the 3rd defendant. The letter two now appeal to this 
						Court to overturn the judgment. The plaintiff filed 
						original and additional grounds of appeal but he argued 
						the following:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">ADDITIONAL GROUND (C)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The judgment itself is 
						a nullity since the trial judge did not give opportunity 
						to the plaintiff to call evidence to rebut the 3rd 
						defendant who joined the the action after close of the 
						case of the plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">ADDITIONAL GROUND (D)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Learned trial Judge 
						erred in relying on exhibits 1 and 2, the admission of 
						which is on appeal (interlocutory appeal).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">ADDITIONAL GROUND (F)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned trial Judge 
						erred in accepting the case of the 1st defendant when 
						the alleged certificate of purchase was not&nbsp; tendered, 
						and the extent of the land and the position of the land 
						were not shown.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">ADDITIONAL GROUND (H)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned trial Judge 
						erred in holding that the plaintiff is estopped per rem 
						judicatam by the case of LTC Davis vrs. Norweh (1912) 
						when the plaintiff was not a party to the suit.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">ADDITIONAL GROUND (A)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned trial Judge 
						failed in discharging the legal duty on him of giving 
						reasoned judgment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">ADDITIONAL GROUND (B)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned trial Judge 
						failed to make findings of fact.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">ADDITIONAL GROUND (E)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 1st defendant had 
						no capacity to claim the land from his own root of 
						title. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The grounds of appeal 
						filed by the 3rd defendant may be incorporated into 
						those filed by the plaintiff. Additional grounds 1, 2 
						and 4 and original ground 1(v) all focused attention on 
						Exhibit 1and 2 that is the judgment relied upon by the 
						1st defendant in proving estoppel. Again original ground 
						1(iv) and additional ground (3) stated that the trial 
						was a nullity because the 3rd defendant was not given an 
						opportunity to cross-examine the plaintiff and his 
						witnesses. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I wish to start with 
						the issues relating to estoppel. The 1st defendant 
						testified that the land in dispute belonged to his 
						grandfather by the name L.T.C Davis, a Sierra Leonean 
						who domiciled in the then Gold Coast and was dead, 
						survived by his three children including the 1st 
						defendant&#8217;s father S.L.S Davis who survived the rest.&nbsp; 
						When the said S.L.S Davis died the 1st defendant 
						inherited him and took the properties of the grandfather 
						that had devolved upon him through succession by the 
						male line as appertained to the inheritance law applied 
						to children borne of Sierra Leoneans in &#8220;Ghana. There 
						was an issue about the authenticity of the judgment 
						which the 1st&nbsp; defendant pleaded as estoppel against the 
						plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have carefully 
						examined the controversial exhibits 1 and 2 representing 
						the judgment and the plan of the land in respect of 
						which the judgment was given and I came to the firm 
						conclusion that the judgment was in respect of the land 
						in dispute and it accordingly operated as estoppel per 
						rem judicatam. The learned trial judge summed up the 
						position accurately at page 81 of the record of appeal 
						as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The judgment dated 
						1912 is a suit between L.T.C Davis vrs. Norweh. The 1st 
						defendant has pleaded in paragraph 6 &amp; 9 of his 
						statement of defence. I am convinced that the judgment 
						is a certified true copy of the suit which was heard in 
						1912. Again the plan was certified by the man who 
						prepared it (i.e Essien). The date he certified it was 
						1927. My understanding is that the&nbsp; plan was previously 
						made way before 1912 or after 1912 and a copy of the&nbsp; 
						plan was made and certified by one Andrew Essien in 
						1927. In my sound judgment these two documents are 
						relevant to the suit before this court. Accordingly the 
						documents will be admitted, they are to be marked&nbsp; as 
						Exhibit 1 for judgment and Exhibit 2 for the plan&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The evidence of the 
						surveyor Andrew Essien appears at page 223 of the record 
						of appeal and it puts all doubts about the identity of 
						the land at rest. I did not in any way see the 
						tenability of the argument that the exhibits 1 and 2 
						contravened the requirements of section 146 of the 
						Evidence Decree 1975 (NRCD 323). From the surveyor&#8217;s 
						evidence it is quite clear that Araba Ayah sold the land 
						to the 1st defendant&#8217;s predecessor and the land was the 
						one in dispute, situate at Kotokobun.&nbsp; From the evidence 
						of the 1st defendant regarding the search that led him 
						to discover exhibits 1 and 2 and the Statement made by 
						the learned Judge on the said exhibit (see pages 223 and 
						228 of the record of appeal), I am fully satisfied with 
						the authenticity of the exhibits. Counsel for the 1st 
						defendant referred this court to passages in Halsburys 
						Laws of England 3rd Edition Vol. 15 paragraph 636 at 
						page 354 on the law on ancient documents. The law is 
						correctly stated but I would advise that section 146 of 
						our Evidence Decree (supra) adequately deals with the 
						point and it should be read along with the commentary 
						thereon to catch the true tenor of the legislation on 
						ancient documents. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Under section 146 of 
						the Evidence Decree (supra) &#8220;the document must be free 
						on its face from suspicion, must be from proper custody, 
						and be at least twenty (20) years old. The guarantee is 
						based on the experience that a document not shown to be 
						a fraud in 20 years in likely to be genuine. It is also 
						based on convenience, for it might be difficult to find 
						witnesses who could testify to its execution&#8221;. It seems 
						to me clear that exhibits 1 &amp; 2 satisfy all these 
						criteria. Their authenticity is given a further boost by 
						the testimony of the 3rd defendant as underscored by his 
						answer to a question in cross&#8211;examination appearing at 
						p.150 of the record of appeal:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Q. Can you tell the 
						Court how the disputed land came to be in&nbsp; the&nbsp; 
						possession of L.T.C Davis ?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp; The disputed land 
						was auctioned after Araba Aryah had filed notice of 
						Sale. L.T.C Davis was auctioneer. The land was sold to 
						L.T.C Davis&#8221;. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">That the disputed land 
						was sold to his grandfather L.T.C Davis by Araba Aryah 
						has been the clarion claim of the 1st defendant right 
						from the inception of the litigation. The 3rd defendant 
						could have strengthened the 1st defendant&#8217;s case further 
						if the learned trial Judge had permitted him to tender 
						the judgment in the case titled Parker vrs. Arabah Aryah 
						in which Araba Aryah obtained Judgment. Last but not the 
						least Exhibit 3D1 tendered by the defendant and 
						appearing at page 231 of the record of appeal confirms 
						that there was in fact such a Judgment by His Worship 
						H.C.W Grimshaw. This exhibit 3D1 represents the Judgment 
						of the Full Court in the suit between L.C.T Davis vrs. 
						Norweh dated 18th November 1914.&nbsp; The registrar C.E. 
						Brew certifies it as the Judgment of the Court. It is 
						true, as Counsel for the 1st defendant concedes, that 
						Arabah Aryah was not a party to the&nbsp; suit but the 
						plaintiff claims through her and so does the 3rd 
						defendant. It was also not in controversy (see PW1&#8217;s 
						evidence) that Madam Araba Aryah gave evidence in L.T.C. 
						Davis v. Norweh suit that she had sold part of the land 
						to L.T.C Davis. This as was rightly submitted by Counsel 
						for the 1st&nbsp; defendant, was a statement binding on all 
						her descendants or those claiming through her, being a 
						declaration against her proprietary&nbsp; interest.&nbsp; </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The issue of estoppel 
						was therefore established against the 1st and 3rd 
						defendants. On the question of the 1st defendant&#8217;s 
						capacity, it is sufficient to refer to the case of Davis 
						v. Randull (1963) 1 GLR 382 holding (2) cited by Counsel 
						for the 1st defendant in his statement of case, a 
						judgment of the Supreme Court of the First Republic of 
						Ghana, that the children of a Sierra Leonean constituted 
						his family for the purposes of succession to his 
						property acquired in Ghana, the lex situs being the 
						applicable law to landed property as in the instant 
						case. Consequently the 1st defendant on the evidence was 
						clothed with capacity to litigate title to the disputed 
						land. It was contended by Counsel for the plaintiff that 
						failure to tender the certificate of purchase of the 
						land was fatal. I disagree.&nbsp; No miscarriage of justice 
						ever occurred thereby because in exhibit 1, Grimshaw 
						stated clearly that such certificate had been issued to 
						the purchaser following the auction sale of the disputed 
						land. The ready inference is that the certificate was 
						tendered before Grimshaw and that should settle all 
						lingering doubts about the veracity of the 1st 
						defendant&#8217;s story. Another suit which also established 
						estoppel was the suit between Opanin Ngyah Asafuah, an 
						elder of the plaintiff&#8217;s family and L.T.F Sagoe which 
						occurred during the life time of L.T.C Davis, 
						grandfather of the 1st defendant. (see Exhibit 3 and 3A 
						). All the matters that I have endeavoured to discuss 
						satisfy me that the learned trial judge was right in the 
						conclusions of law and fact that he made. Consequently I 
						hold that there is no merit whatsoever in the grounds of 
						appeal filed by both the plaintiff and the 3rd 
						defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I wish however to say 
						something about the contention by the two appellants 
						that they were not given opportunity to state their 
						cases further after the joinder of the 3rd defendant. 
						The plaintiff and the 3rd defendant did not give this 
						court any indication of what further evidence they had 
						wanted to adduce which was so material to their case 
						that its inclusion might have affected the decision of 
						the trial Court or this Court and that a substantial 
						miscarriage of justice had been thereby occasioned. In 
						my view the real issue in the suit was adequately tried 
						and determined and I do not see on what ground the trial 
						could be said to be a nullity as contended by the 
						plaintiff and the 3rd defendant. Grounds (A) and (B) 
						were unmeritorious and they&nbsp; fail. In the result the 
						appeals are dismissed.</span></p>
