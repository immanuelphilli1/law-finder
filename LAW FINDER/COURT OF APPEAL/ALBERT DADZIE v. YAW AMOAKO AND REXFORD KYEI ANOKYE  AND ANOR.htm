						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A brief background to 
						the interpleader summons, which has resulted in this 
						appeal is as follows: On 12th April 1991 the appellant 
						who is the plaintiff/ judgment/creditor obtained 
						judgment against the defendant/judgment/debtor, Yaw 
						Amoako in the sum DM 12039.00 plus damages of ¢200,000 
						and costs of ¢50,000.00. On 31st October 1991, pursuant 
						to praecipe for the issue of writ of fi:fa, Plot Number 
						28A, Block IX Gyinyase, Kumasi, property of the judgment 
						debtor, was attached in execution of the said judgment. 
						On 18th November 1991, the sheriff issued an order 
						prohibiting alienation of the property attached (exhibit 
						4). He also issued a notice of auction. The sheriff's 
						officer attached property No. 28A Block IX Gyinyase by 
						serving a copy of exhibit 4 on the judgment debtor, Yaw 
						Amoako and by affixing another copy on the property to 
						be attached. On 25th November 1991, the sheriff 
						entrusted the conduct of the auction sale to a licensed 
						auctioneer. Subsequent to these processes, the judgment 
						debtor on 9th July 1992 issued a receipt for ¢2,500,000 
						in favour of Rexford Kyei Anokye, the claimant in the 
						interpleader summons and respondent this appeal, being 
						the price of the attached property purchased by the 
						respondent. According to the receipt, the money was 
						supposed to have been received by the judgment debtor on 
						10th July 1992. The receipt for the payment of the 
						purchase price was followed by a statutory declaration 
						dated 28th August 1992 from the defendant/judgment 
						debtor reciting a transfer by him of the property to the 
						respondent. On 30th October 1992, the respondent filed 
						notice of his claim, which the appellant disputed by 
						notice dated 11th November 1992. The High Court heard 
						the case and gave judgment in favour of respondent in 
						respect of his &quot;reliefs sought in the interpleader 
						claim&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Originally, the 
						appellant filed only one ground of appeal, namely &quot;The 
						decision is against the weight of evidence. He however 
						filed four additional grounds of appeal as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(1) The learned trial 
						judge erred in law when he held that the purported sale 
						by the judgment/debtor of the attached property was 
						lawful and upheld his claim. His Lordship thereby 
						ignored the provisions of Order 43 rules 7, 10, 11 of 
						the Rules of the High Court, 1954,</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) The learned trial 
						judge erred In law when he held that the claimant was a 
						bona fide purchaser for value of the property without 
						notice. There was no evidence that the claimant acquired 
						the legal title in the property.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(3) The learned trial 
						judge erred in law when he held that the writ of 
						execution was unexecuted within the meaning of the word 
						In Order 42 rule 19 even though the evidence showed that 
						the property in dispute had been attached under the 
						writ.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(4) The trial was 
						unsatisfactory as the learned judge failed to make the 
						necessary findings.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In his written 
						statement of the appellant' case, counsel for the 
						appellant dwelt only on the additional grounds of 
						appeal. I intend to take all the four additional grounds 
						together. In concluding the reasons for his judgment 
						which had been given earlier, the learned trial judge 
						explained what he considered being the operation of 
						Order 42 rule 19 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) 
						Rules, 1954 (L.N. 140A). Before coming to that, I think 
						it would be appropriate to quote in full Order 42 rule 
						19. It reads:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;A writ of execution if 
						unexecuted shall remain In force for one year only from 
						its issue, unless renewed in the manner hereinafter 
						provided, but such writ may, at any time before its 
						expiration, by leave of the Court or a Judge, be renewed 
						by the party issuing it for one year from the date of 
						such renewal, anal so on from time to time during the 
						continuance of the renewed writ, either by being marked 
						with a seal of the Court bearing the date of the day, 
						month, year of such renewal, or by such party giving a 
						written notice of renewal to the sheriffs signed by the 
						party or his solicitor, and bearing the like seal of the 
						Court, and a writ of execution so renewed shall have 
						effect, and be entitled' to priority, according to the 
						time of the original delivery thereof.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Since the trial judge 
						based his judgment on what he considered to be the 
						correct interpretation of Order 42 rule 19, I would do 
						well to quote in full what he had to say in his judgment 
						relating to the implication of that rule. In his 
						judgment at page 81 of the record of appeal the learned 
						judge stated as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Now under Order 42 
						rule 19, 'A writ of execution if unexecuted shall remain 
						in force for one year only from its issue, unless 
						renewed ...'</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As at 31st October 
						1992, and in particular as at 11th November 1992 when 
						the claimant's claim was disputed therefore, the writ of 
						execution, the Prohibition Notice, and all the other 
						execution processes had ceased, in my humble opinion, to 
						have any legal effect. The claimant who thus purchased 
						the property in good faith, and without notice of the 
						judgment against Yaw Amoako, or the attachment on the 
						property itself at the site, as proved by the videotape 
						shown in court, is therefore entitled in the 
						circumstances to have the property.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The attachment was 
						therefore formally discharged. This is all the basis of 
						my said judgment.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Since the judgment of 
						the court below apparently turned on the word 
						'unexecuted' contained in the above quoted rule 19 of 
						Order 42, it would be appropriate if we look at how that 
						word has been judicially considered in another 
						jurisdiction. In the case of Lloyds and Scottish Finance 
						Ltd. v. Modern Cars and Caravans (Kingston) Ltd. [1964] 
						3 W.L.R. 859 at pages 870 and 871 Edmund Davis J. had 
						this to say when he was faced with the meaning to be 
						attached to that word in a legislation:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Notwithstanding these 
						findings as to seizure on April 14 and non-abandonment 
						thereof, counsel for the defendants submits that in May 
						his clients acquired from Wood a good title unencumbered 
						by the judgment debt due from his vendor or any rights 
						possessed by the sheriff under the writ, and that this 
						title they in due course passed on to the plaintiffs. 
						The submission is a startling one, for, badly stated, it 
						amounts to an assertion that, even although the sheriff 
						had already seized the caravan, the defendants acquired 
						title free from any liability to have their property 
						seized.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The corollary to this 
						submission would appear to be that they could have 
						demanded its unconditional surrender by the plaintiff. 
						In so far as I was able to follow it, the basis for the 
						submission appears to be this: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) Under the proviso 
						to section 26 of Act of 1893 a purchaser in good faith 
						and for valuable consideration gets a good title 
						unfettered by any right of seizure in the sheriff, 
						provided that when he purchased he had no notice that a 
						writ of fieri facias by virtue of which the goods of the 
						execution 'debtor might be seized ... had been delivered 
						to and remained 'unexecuted' in the hands of the 
						sheriff.'</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) Where an execution 
						issues, the transaction involves four stages: (1) 
						delivery of the writ to the sheriff; (2) seizure; (3) 
						the possible payment of the money after the seizure; and 
						(4) if no payment, sale . . . . </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) Until either 
						payment or sale, the writ remains 'unexecuted</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d) The defendants 
						having bought the caravan from Wood in May and the 
						sheriff's sale not taking, place until August, the writ 
						(of which they had no notice) 'remained unexecuted' when 
						they bought.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(e) As against the 
						sheriff, they were accordingly protected by the proviso 
						to section 26, and this protection enured to the 
						plaintiffs when they in due course purchased the caravan 
						from the defendants.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I propose to deal with 
						this submission briefly. The proviso must of necessity 
						be limited in its operation to the ambit of the section 
						which it qualifies. When, by the opening words of the 
						section, it is provided that 'a writ of fieri facias ... 
						shall bind the property in the goods of the execution 
						debtor ...' this simply means that on the delivery of 
						the writ the sheriff acquires a legal right to seize 
						sufficient of the debtor's goods to satisfy the amount 
						specified in the writ (Samuel v. Duke 1838 3 M. &amp; W. 
						622). The proviso, accordingly, does no more than 
						protect a purchaser of the goods against the right of 
						seizure if the stated conditions are fulfilled. But it 
						has no scope of operation where an actual seizure of the 
						debtor's goods has already been effected; and where this 
						has occurred, it is immaterial whether or not the 
						purchaser from the debtor had notice of the seizure, or 
						even of the writ. Furthermore by its wording the proviso 
						relates only to the writ 'by virtue of which the goods 
						of the execution debtor might be seized', and where such 
						an essential step in execution as actual seizure had 
						already been effected, it is, I hold, impossible to 
						regard the writ as one which still 'remained unexecuted 
						in the hands of the sheriff'. In my judgment, according 
						the defendants are not saved by the proviso.&quot; (The 
						emphasis mine)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instant case the 
						property of the judgment debtor had been attached and 
						the sheriff took steps for auction sale of the attached 
						property to be effected. After the judgment debtor's 
						property had been attached on 31st October 1991, the 
						sheriff issued a notice prohibiting alienation of the 
						property attached as well as give notice of the auction 
						on 18th November 1991. On 25th November 1991, he 
						actually entrusted the conduct of the auction sale to a 
						licensed auctioneer. It is worthy of note that all these 
						took place within one year of the issue of writ of 
						fi:fa. By his judgment, the learned trial judge seems to 
						be of the opinion that so long as the matter remains in 
						the hands of the sheriff the writ of execution is 
						'unexecuted'. If we go by the interpretation the court 
						below puts on the word 'unexecuted', it would mean that 
						even if all steps in the execution process are carried 
						out and for some reason the matter still remains in the 
						hands of the sheriff after the expiration of one year, 
						for example where the auctioneer is yet to conduct the 
						auction sale, the writ would&nbsp; cease to remain in force 
						as in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instant case. Such an interpretation 
						would obviously lead to totally absurd consequences. For 
						example if that interpretation were to hold, all that a 
						judgment debtor would do to prevent auction sale of his 
						property after it has been attached would be to resort 
						to spurious applications and processes, which are 
						allowed by the rules, to delay the auction sale of the 
						attached property in the hope that the matter would 
						remain in the hands of the sheriff for over a year, 
						which hopefully would make the writ of execution cease 
						to remain in force. I quite agree with the stand taken 
						by Edmund Davis J., in the case of Lloyds and Scottish 
						Finance Lt. v. Modern Cars and Caravans (Kingston) Ltd. 
						(supra) that &quot;where such an essential step in execution 
						as actual seizure has already been effected, it is, &#8230;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						impossible to regard the writ as one which still 
						'remained unexecuted&quot; in the hands of the sheriff&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This erodes the whole 
						basis of the judgment of the court below as indicated by 
						the learned trial judge. I would however like to refer 
						to a clear provision of the law, which should lay the 
						issue of innocent purchaser for value without notice 
						raised by the respondent's counsel to rest. According to 
						Order 43 rule 11 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) 
						Rules:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;After any attachment 
						shall have been made by actual seizure, or by written 
						order as aforesaid, and in case of an attachment by 
						written order, after it shall have been duly intimated 
						and made known in manner aforesaid, any alienation 
						without leave of the Court of the property attached, 
						whether by sale, gift, or otherwise, any payment of debt 
						or debts, or dividends, or shares to the judgment debtor 
						during the continuance of the attachment, shall be null 
						and void, and the person making such alienation or 
						payment shall be deemed to have committed a contempt of 
						Court.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">According to the 
						wording of Order 43 rule 11, it is immaterial whether or 
						not the purchaser from the debtor had notice of the 
						seizure, or even of the writ of execution. During the 
						Continuance of the attachment, the rule places the 
						attached property in the hands of the Court through the 
						sheriff. That would therefore render any alienation 
						without leave of the Court null and avoid as well as a 
						subject matter of sanction by the Court. For the reasons 
						given in this judgment, I allow the appeal and set aside 
						the judgment of the court below.</span></p>
