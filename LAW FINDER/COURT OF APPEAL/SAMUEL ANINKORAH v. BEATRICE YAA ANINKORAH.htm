						<span style="font-family: Arial">OWUSU-ANSAH, JA:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The parties got married 
						customarily in 1969. The marriage was converted into 
						monogamous marriage under the marriage Ordinance on the 
						17th September 1982 &#8211; at the Church of Pentecost Temple, 
						Labadi, Accra-Ghana.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The parties lived in 
						Accra with the six (6) children of the marriage. </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Since 1983 the husband 
						Petitioner, a staff of the Ghana Army, has been living 
						and working in Israel; as Food and Beverage Manager of 
						the United Nations (NIFIL) in Israel; where the wife 
						(Respondent) and children later joined him. The children 
						were subsequently transferred to London with the 
						Respondent for their education. The respondent since 
						1995 has been living in Ghana.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In or about 1993 the 
						parties started having problems with their marriage. 
						During the marriage, the matrimonial home, H/No. B 94/31 
						Kwashieman, Accra was acquired. Later another plot was 
						acquired near the matrimonial home for a hospitality 
						project.&nbsp; According to the Petitioner, he also acquired 
						a two-bed room house also in Tema.&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In 1996 however whilst 
						the monogamous marriage with the Respondent was still 
						subsisting the Petitioner married one Catherine Johnson, 
						and registered the said marriage at the office of the 
						Accra Metropolitan Assembly. At the instance of the 
						Respondent the High Court, Accra on the 27 April, 1998, 
						declared the said marriage null and void in Suit No. F. 
						1673/96.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In 1998, the Petitioner 
						attempted to throw the Respondent onto the Street from 
						the said matrimonial&nbsp; home H/No. B 94/31 Kwashieman, 
						Accra.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In a suit filed by the 
						Respondent in the high Court, Accra, Suit No. MC 50/98, 
						an Injunction order was granted restraining the 
						Petitioner from so doing.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the 12-6-98, the 
						Petitioner filed a petition for divorce in the Circuit 
						Court, Accra. On the application of the 
						Respondent/Appellant the petition was transferred to the 
						High /Court, Accra, for trial.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Earlier the Circuit 
						Court had awarded ¢300,000.00 as monthly maintenance 
						allowance to the Respondent. The Petitioner apparently 
						paid for only three (3) months and he stopped any 
						further payments.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The High Court, Accra 
						refused to enforce the Summons to show cause in respect 
						of the arrears totalling ¢6.3 million and it has not 
						been paid to date.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The wife Respondent, 
						with leave of the High Court, cross-petitioned for 
						divorce on the grounds of adultery, desertion, cruelty 
						and unreasonable behaviour on the part of the Husband 
						Petitioner.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Respondent also 
						asked for ancillary reliefs, settlement of H/No. B 
						94/31, Kwashieman, Accra, where she had been living over 
						the years, and a lump sum of ¢80 million.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the 24th November, 
						2000 the High Court presided over by her Lordship Ms. 
						Agnes Dordzie dissolved the marriage, and adjourned 
						proceedings to take evidence on the ancillary reliefs 
						and the Respondent's cross-Petition.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Court on the 31st 
						July, 2001 gave judgment and dismissed respondents 
						cross-Petition. In its place the Judge ordered that the 
						Petitioner conveys &#8220;a Tema house to the Respondent and 
						pay her ¢40 million cedis as a financial settlement.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Respondent being 
						aggrieved or dissatisfied with the judgment dismissing 
						her cross-petition filed the instant appeal on 3rd 
						August, 2001.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The grounds of appeal 
						include the following:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1.&nbsp; The judgment is 
						against the weight of evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2.&nbsp; The learned trial 
						judge did not give sufficient consideration to 
						respondent&#8217;s case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3. The Learned Trial 
						Judge erred when she held that the only means by which a 
						wife could acquire interest in property acquired by the 
						husband is either by agreement, or direct or indirect 
						substantial contribution(s).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">4. The learned trial 
						judge failed to exercise her discretion fairly and 
						equitably when she ordered the respondent, who has lived 
						the greater part of her life in Accra, to leave the 
						matrimonial home she claims to be settled on her, to 
						another house in Tema, where she does not even know nor 
						has ever lived, and an entirely different environment in 
						over 33 years of marriage.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">5. Additional grounds 
						of Appeal to be filed upon receipt of the record of 
						proceedings.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Let me deal first with 
						Ground 1, that is to say, &#8220;The judgment is against the 
						weight of evidence.&#8221;&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 
						Respondent/Appellant&#8217;s Counsel submits that the trial 
						judge&#8217;s findings cannot be supported by the evidence 
						adduced at the trial.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In her evidence the 
						respondent/appellant stated, among other things, that 
						she was told by her husband that her allowance was 
						$500.00 (five hundred US dollars) per month, but the 
						husband never gave her the money. He made her understand 
						that he was going to use that money to build a house so 
						that when they come to Ghana they would have a place to 
						live, according to the wife Appellant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Therefore, so says the 
						Appellant, she has contributed to the acquisition of 
						H/No. B 94/31 Kwashieman, Accra. The Husband Petitioner 
						put up the house on the piece of land bought by him 
						using the allowances.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 
						Petitioner/Respondent emphatically denied that the 
						respondent/Appellant (&#8220;the Appellant&#8221;) contributed 
						anything to the acquisition of the house in dispute.&nbsp; He 
						added that he never explained the contents of his 
						appointment letter to the appellant as she alleges. His 
						appointment letter, he said, did not state that his 
						spouse was entitled to any allowances.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He explained that the 
						UN salary system had something called family support, 
						which depended on the number of children had, and was 
						included in the salary. No allowances were paid to any 
						spouse. The appellant, therefore, did not earn any 
						allowance of $500.00 per month as alleged which he kept. 
						He said he started building the house in question in 
						1988, and there has been no contribution &#8211; direct or 
						indirect, from the appellant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned judge 
						meticulously reviewed and assessed the evidence and 
						concluded that &#8220;This is a claim in the appellant&#8217;s 
						cross-petition. The onus, therefore, lies on her to 
						prove that she actually earned the $500.00 monthly 
						allowance from UNIFIL</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Unfortunately, said the 
						learned trial judge, the appellant never adduced any 
						evidence to prove her assertions.&nbsp; The claim therefore 
						remained mere assertions which cannot succeed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Quite clearly, the 
						learned trial judge found as a fact that the Petitioner 
						had not discharged the requisite burden of proof in 
						accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Decree, 
						1975 (NRCD 323).&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Especially Sections 11 
						and 12, and Section 7 (3) and (4) makes corroboration no 
						longer a requirement in our law. Nevertheless, there is 
						a fundamental difference between the question whether 
						there is any evidence, and the question whether there is 
						enough evidence to discharge the burden of proof &#8211; 
						albeit on the preponderance of probabilities.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this case the 
						learned trial judge found as a fact that the Appellant 
						had failed to discharge the burden. That finding is 
						amply supported by the evidence. Once the trial judge 
						has found the primary facts, stated the findings, and 
						applied the law, the hands of the appellate court are 
						tied, subject to a few inapplicable exceptions.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In Fofie v. Zanyo 1992 
						2 GLR 475&nbsp; at 478 Holding (4). The Supreme Court held 
						among other things that :</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Where the findings of 
						fact could not be said to be supported by evidence or is 
						wrong because the tribunal had taken into account 
						matters which were irrelevant in law, or had excluded 
						matters which were crucially necessary for 
						consideration, or had come to a conclusion which no 
						Court, properly instructing itself, on the law, would 
						have reached, and the findings were not inferences drawn 
						from specific facts, it was incompetent for an appeal 
						court&nbsp; to interfere. So too where it can be demonstrated 
						that the judge misapprehended the evidence or drew wrong 
						inferences from the evidence.&#8221; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instant case I 
						can find no evidence that the Respondent&#8217;s pay slips 
						and, indeed, his appointment letter were classified 
						documents.&nbsp; Therefore, I am unable to fathom why no 
						&#8217;Notice to produce&#8217; them could not have been served on 
						the Petitioner/Respondent since the facts were 
						peculiarly within his own knowledge. Indeed his refusal 
						to produce them in the circumstances would in my view 
						have spoken volumes. Even assuming without admitting 
						that the money ($500.00) was included in the 
						respondent&#8217;s monthly pay packet the evidence was that it 
						was meant for the maintenance of the family, and it was 
						so used.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In short the appellant 
						had a burden; she failed to discharge that burden as was 
						found by the learned judge. The evidence that could have 
						tilted the balance in her favour was inadequate or 
						unavailable to the Court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my view this ground 
						of appeal fails. I hold that the judgment was not 
						against the weight of the evidence adduced.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The law abounds with

						<span style="font-family: Arial">Ground 2:&nbsp; &#8220;The learned 
						judge did not give any sufficient consideration to the 
						respondent's case.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this connection it 
						was submitted on behalf of the Appellant that &#8220;the 
						learned judge did not evaluate the respondent&#8217;s evidence 
						against that of the Petitioner thoroughly; or else it 
						would have been established that he Petitioner admitted 
						the existence of the family support allowance according 
						to the&nbsp; number of dependents including a spouse.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was further 
						submitted that the learned judge could also have found 
						by scuttling of Exhibit &#8216;I&#8217; the Ruling of the High 
						Court, Accra, in Suit No. MC 50/98 that the intention of 
						the Petitioner was to drive away the Appellant out of 
						the matrimonial home.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel also refers to 
						&#8220;the great hardship, inconvenience and unfairness that 
						the Judge&#8217;s order to uproot her (the Appellant) to Tema 
						house, from Accra, where she lives and trades, would 
						cause to her.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The evidence was that 
						the family support was included in the Petitioner&#8217;s 
						Salary and that was used in providing for the family&#8217;s 
						financial, health, educational and social needs while 
						they were sojourning both in Israel and in Britain.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Apart from the mention 
						of $500 which the Respondent denied, there was no 
						allusion to any other contribution or assistance by the 
						Appellant. &#8220;He who asserts must prove&#8221; is a cardinal 
						rule of evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The principles 
						enunciated by Ollennu J in Adom v. Kwarley (1962) 1 GLR 
						112 would have been applicable, had the learned Judge 
						found as a fact that the Respondent/Appellant made a 
						contribution.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Moreover the fact that 
						the children of the marriage live abroad does not help 
						the Appellant&#8217;s care. Indeed the Supreme Court held in 
						Mensah v. Mensah (1993-94) 1GLR 111 at 112 that under 
						customary law children could not claim any specific 
						share of their parents property even if they helped them 
						to acquire it unless any such child had contributed 
						specifically to the acquisition with the intention that 
						he or she should have a share of any property so 
						acquired. (Intestate succession laws apart)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this case there is 
						no exhibition of any clear intention on&nbsp; the part of the 
						parties to purchase the house jointly for themselves and 
						their children coupled with a contribution by the&nbsp; 
						Respondent/Appellant towards the acquisition of the 
						house in question.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Consequently I am of 
						the view that the learned Judge did give adequate 
						consideration to the Appellant&#8217;s case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Ground (iii) &#8220;The 
						learned Trial Judge erred when she held that the means 
						by which a wife could acquire interest in property, 
						acquired by the husband, is either by agreement, or 
						direct or indirect substantial contribution&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Here it was submitted 
						on behalf of the appellant that if the Learned Trial 
						Judge had adverted her mind to the power granted the 
						High Court under Section 20(1) of the Matrimonial cause 
						Act 1971 and all the circumstances of this case, she 
						would not have simply dismissed the Respondent&#8217;s cross 
						petition for ancillary reliefs by merely accepting what 
						the Petitioner pleases as provision for the Respondent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">For ease of reference 
						S.20 (1) of the Act (i.e. Act 367) provides as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The Court may order 
						either party to the marriage to pay to the other party 
						such sum of money, or convey to the other party, such 
						movable or immovable&nbsp; property&nbsp; as settlement of 
						property rights, or in&nbsp; lieu thereof, as part of 
						financial provision as the court may think just and 
						equitable&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is true that this 
						marriage which was dissolved on the 21/11/2000 was a 
						monogamous one, and therefore, the section is 
						applicable.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">However, the power 
						given to the Court under S.21 (1) is discretionary just 
						as the Court also has power under Section 26(1) of the 
						Act to rescind dispositions found to have been made with 
						intent to defeat the financial provision or property 
						settlement of the other party.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">That discretion cannot 
						be exercised capriciously but&nbsp; in accordance with the 
						settled principles that govern the exercise of judicial 
						discretion having regard to the facts and the 
						surrounding circumstances of each case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The law, as I 
						understand it, and as expounded in a bewildering variety 
						of decided cases, is that a spouse by going to live in a 
						matrimonial home, the sole property of the other spouse, 
						does not thereby acquire any interest therein.&nbsp; The 
						spouse (normally the wife) has only a right to live 
						there as a spouse.&nbsp; That right ceases after divorce.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Be that as it may, 
						however to this rule a number of exceptions have been 
						recognized:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1)&nbsp; Where there has 
						been an agreement between the parties so that though the 
						property is in the sole name of the husband for example, 
						as the legal &nbsp;owner, he gives the wife a beneficial 
						interest in it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) Where the wife made 
						a direct or indirect substantial contribution to the 
						property in money&#8217;s worth.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(3) The third 
						exception, I would think is the discretionary power 
						given to the court under S.20 (1) of the Matrimonial 
						causes Act 1971.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There is a plethora of 
						authorities on the point both local and foreign.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The leading case of 
						Rebeiro v. Ribeiro (1989-90) 2 GLR 109, citing with 
						approval the English case of Pettitt v. Pettitt (1969) 2 
						ALL ER 385, and Acheampong v. Acheampong (1982-83) GLR 
						1017 CA&nbsp; are all cases in point.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In another case of 
						OPAREBEA vs. MENSAH&nbsp; GLR 1053, Lamptey JA, (as he then 
						was) observed at page&nbsp; 1061</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;With great respect to 
						the trial Judge, he erred in law looking for evidence of 
						contribution to support the Appellant's claim under 
						Section 20(1) of Act 367. Said the learned Judge: &#8220;In 
						the Ribeiro case the Supreme Court indicated that to 
						ascertain and determine a claim made under S.20(1) of 
						Act 367 the Court&nbsp; must examine the needs of the party 
						making the claim. The Court in the appropriate cases 
						must make reasonable provision for their satisfaction 
						out of money, goods or immovable property of his or her 
						spouse.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instant case it 
						seems to me that the learned trial judge was mainly 
						concerned with the husband&#8217;s offer without adequately 
						considering section 20(1) and its impact on the 
						Appellant&#8217;s claim.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned Judge 
						observed:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The Petitioner has 
						offered to compensate her (the Respondent/Appellant) for 
						the services she has offered him as a wife for over 
						30years with the Tema house and ¢40m (forty million 
						cedis).&nbsp; This I consider reasonable and fair&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The evidence is that 
						the Appellant spent the best part of her years (32yrs to 
						be exact) with the Petitioner. Her income earning 
						capacity has been drastically reduced by virtue of her 
						age. On the other hand, the Petitioner is apparently 
						still gainfully employed by the U.N in Israel. There is 
						also evidence on record that he has other properties in 
						addition to the two houses.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Having regard to all 
						the respective circumstances of the parties, I would 
						order that ¢10m (ten million) be added to the financial 
						provision would substitute fifty million cedis for the 
						¢40million cedis ordered by the Court below to be paid 
						by the Petitioner/Respondent to the Appellant as 
						financial provision for the appellant pursuant to S.20 
						(1) of Act 367. Also see Barake v. Barake (1993-93) 1GLR 
						635 at 638. The amount is hereby varied accordingly. 
						Subject to that I would dismissed this ground of appeal 
						as well.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I would now like to 
						consider the final ground of this appeal. That is Ground 
						iv, which states: &#8220;The learned Trial Judge did not 
						exercise her discretion fairly and equitably in ordering 
						the Respondent to settle in a Tema two bedroom house&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Again it was submitted 
						that the trial judge failed to consider the unfavourable 
						consequences her order would have on the Respondent, as 
						she had never lived&nbsp; in Tema during her 32 years of 
						marriage to the Petitioner. She had at all material 
						times lived in Accra where she has her friends and other 
						links. All her six children are in London and they live 
						with her in the said house whenever they visit Accra.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel for the 
						Appellant contends that the decision of the trial court 
						was unfair and was made without consideration of all the 
						necessary factors such as&nbsp; hardship, inconvenience 
						frustration and interruption in the Appellant's life and 
						standard of&nbsp; life both in Israel and in London. These 
						are rather sentimental and emotive words indeed as 
						against the story and sometimes harsh realities of legal 
						provisions.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In response thereto, 
						Counsel for the Petitioner/Respondent (the husband) 
						refer to the case of Acheampong v. Acheampong (1982-83) 
						GLR at 259.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my view, the&nbsp; trial 
						judge could not be faulted, she was very circumspect&nbsp; in 
						her analysis of the&nbsp; facts and circumstances, and in the 
						fullness of her wisdom, decided to exercise her 
						discretion in the way she did, supported no doubt by the 
						facts of the case. This court finds itself regretfully 
						unable to usurp the functions of the trial judge by 
						substituting its discretion for hers.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The observation by 
						Abban J.A, as he then was, in the case of Acheampong vs. 
						Acheampong (1982-83) GLR 281 may be worth recalling.&nbsp; He 
						had this to say &#8220;&#8230;.. on hearing the application the 
						Court may order one spouse to transfer to the other 
						land, house, cars or goods, such as furniture and other 
						house hold items.&nbsp; That latter order may be&nbsp; made 
						instead of making an order for money payment, or it can 
						be made in addition to an order for money payment. 
						Everything depends on a lot of factors, the 
						circumstances of the case and above all, on the 
						discretion of the Court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the result, subject 
						to the award of ¢50m (fifty million) instead of ¢40m 
						awarded by the Court below. I think this appeal ought to 
						be dismissed and it is dismissed accordingly.</span></p>
