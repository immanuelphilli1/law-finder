						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is an appeal from 
						the judgment of the circuit court, Odumase Krobo 
						delivered on the 19th May 1999 in a landsuit. The 
						plaintiff who initiated the litigation emerged 
						victorious with an award to him of all the reliefs he 
						sought against the defendant and the co-defendant. The 
						latter two have therefore mounted this appeal but I 
						prefer to adopt for the purposes of this appeal the 
						positions of the parties at the court below and 
						accordingly call them Plaintiff, defendant and 
						co-defendant wherever applicable. As I have already 
						hinted above the parties contested title to a certain 
						piece or parcel of land. The plaintiff based his title 
						to the said land on a grant to him of the land by a 
						family called the &quot;Manya Akromuase.&quot; For his part, the 
						defendant relied on a grant to him by a family known or 
						called &quot;Dokutse Peteye Abla.&quot; In conformity with the 
						practice and procedure in landsuits of this nature, the 
						co-defendant contested on behalf of his family upon 
						being joined as party to the suit to fight on the side 
						of the defendant to clinch common victory. In the event 
						what commenced as a contest between the plaintiff and 
						the defendant at the outset escalated into a full-blown 
						battle between the two families as to which of them 
						originally acquired the land by way of settlement. This 
						type of land litigation, as it is known by all lawyers 
						and judges, entails traditional histories or evidence of 
						varying degrees of complexity, uncertainty and 
						hyperboles sometimes of romantic flavour. In resolving 
						which of two competing traditional histories is the more 
						probable the practice of our profession has been to 
						approach the dispute by applying to the competing 
						traditional histories a time-honoured and time-tested 
						principle which can be found in leading cases such as 
						Adjeibi-Kojo v. Bonsie and Another (1957) 3 WALR 257; 
						Ntsin vii v. Doughan (1960) GLR 26; Beng v. Poku (1965) 
						GLR 167 SC; Darfour Jnr. v. Boateng (1976) 2 GLR 191 CA, 
						and the very recent cases of In re Kodie Stool; Adowaa 
						v. Osei (1998-99) SC GLR 23, In re Taayen &amp; Asaago 
						Stools; Kumanin II (substituted by) Oppon v. Anin 
						(1998-99) SC GLR 1999 where the Supreme Court applied 
						the principle in Adjeibi-Kojo v. Bonsie (Supra). In 
						stating the principle no one should pretend to take any 
						credit by by-passing its progenitor, Lord Denning in the 
						leading case Adjeibi-Kojo v. Bonsie (supra) where Lord 
						Denning said at page 260 of the report:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The dispute was all as 
						to the traditional history which had been handed down by 
						word of mouth from their forefathers. In this regard it 
						must be recognised that in the course of transmission 
						from generation to generation, mistakes may occur 
						without any dishonest motives whatsoever.&nbsp; Witnesses of 
						the utmost veracity may speak honestly but erroneously 
						as to what took place a hundred years ago. Where there 
						is a conflict of traditional history one side or the 
						other must be mistaken, yet both may be honest in their 
						beliefs.&nbsp; In such a case demeanour is little guide to 
						the truth. The best way is to test the traditional 
						history reference to the facts in recent years as 
						established by evidence and by seeing which of the 
						competing histories is the most probable.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A striking illustration 
						of the application of this principle could be found in 
						the recent case of Sophia Lamptey v Adumuah &amp; Another, 
						Court of Appeal, unreported, dated 15th March 2001 where 
						this court in resolving the competing traditional 
						histories as to the ownership of a piece of land, 
						preferred the story of the appellant, basing its 
						decision on the accomplished fact that the only fetish 
						shrine which had for several years been on the land 
						belonged to the appellant's family, while the respondent 
						had no rival account as the existence of the shrine on 
						the disputed land.&nbsp; The court then accepted the 
						appellant's claim that the respondent's family were on 
						the land by permission of the appellant's predecessors.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Relating this approach 
						to the instant case, there are some vital recent facts 
						to consider.&nbsp; First in line was a document tendered by 
						the co-defendant. It was the well-known Jackson Report.&nbsp; 
						In 1954, the then Governor-In-council, appointed a 
						commission headed by Jackson to enquire into the 
						boundaries of the lands vested in the Osudoku stool with 
						any state or communities having boundaries contiguous 
						with the Osudoku stool, other than the boundary already 
						determined pursuant to the Stool Lands Boundaries 
						Settlement (Osudoku/Battor) Order 1953 and by a later 
						order dated 8 April 1954, to enquire into and determine 
						the Northern and Eastern boundaries of Ningo together 
						with the boundaries of any state or community that have 
						boundaries contiguous therewith. The following is what 
						Jackson said about the ancestor of the co-defendant - 
						Dokutse-Peteye:-</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;On arrival 
						Dokutse-Peteye and his followers broke off from Mate 
						Aka's party and settled at America. They were the first 
						settlers on what are now known as the Akuse Lands.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The following averments 
						in the co-defendants statement of defence are 
						significant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(4) In answer to 
						paragraphs 3 and 4 of the statement of claim the 
						co-defendant says that his family, the Dokutse 
						Peteye-Atta Abla family of Akuse and Nuaso are the 
						accredited owners of all that piece or parcel of land 
						stretching from the Akuse township (inclusive) to the 
						Okwe stream. The only family dwelling within the area 
						with the acknowledgment of co-defendants predecessors 
						are the Narh Titriku family, of Natriku.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(5) In further response 
						to the said paragraphs 3 and 4 of the statement of claim 
						the Co-defendant says that neither Chief Sasraku III of 
						Manya Kpongunor nor any entity called &quot;Akromuase People&quot; 
						own or possess land in the area. Plaintiff shall be put 
						to strict proof of the averments pertaining to the said 
						persons ownership.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff in his 
						pleading describes his land as follows:-</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;It contains an 
						approximate area of 34.65 acres and bounded on the South 
						East by Akromuase people's property measuring on that 
						side 1,000 feet more or less, on the North by 
						Akosombo-Afienya Motor Road measuring on that side 1,000 
						feet more or less, on the South West by Somanya-Akuse 
						Motor Road measuring on that side 1,000 feet more or 
						less and on the North East by Akromuase people's land 
						measuring on that side 1,500 feet more or less which 
						piece of land is more particularly delineated on the 
						plan attached and therein shown edged Pink which shows 
						the relevant measurements.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">By the above 
						description and the evidence tendered, plaintiff 
						contended that the land in dispute formed part of land 
						owned by the Akromuase Division of the Manya krobo 
						Traditional and that the part claimed by him was granted 
						to him by Nene Sabraku III, Chief of that division. 
						Further evidence led on behalf of the plaintiff was that 
						the land was situate at a place commonly called and 
						known as &quot;Okwenya&quot;. The traditional history offered by 
						the Akromuase family was that their forefathers settled 
						on the Krobo Mountain and acquired the land, the right 
						to which has devolved upon them and the family had kept 
						possession. The co-defendant contradicted this 
						traditional history by an account to the effect that his 
						forefathers first settled on the Krobo mountain and that 
						the Okwenya land formed part of the lands known as &quot;The 
						Akuse Lands&quot;. The learned trial Circuit Court Judge 
						rejected the traditional history of the co-defendant 
						basing himself on a historical account given by two 
						eminent authors namely NAA Azu in his book entitled 
						&quot;Adamgbe History&quot; and the other one MJ Field. The 
						learned judge stated at page 171 of the appeal record 
						thus:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;In the said Jackson 
						report tendered as Exhibit 8, Commissioner Jackson 
						accepted the history of the Krobos as recorded by NAA 
						Azu and MJ Field&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">These two authors 
						stated that at the time Manya people went to live on the 
						Krobo mountain they were ruled by fetish priests. This 
						is the judge's finding. The judge went on further at the 
						same page to say:-</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;In fact it was 
						Akromuase and Madzu the fetish priests of Naousi and 
						Kroweku who led the Manya people to the Krobo mountain.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">According to NAA Azu at 
						the time the Krobos went to the mountain, it was 
						uninhabited. The trial judge therefore concluded, 
						rightly in my view, that the history told by the 
						co-defendant was more probable. The co-defendant had 
						claimed that his great ancestor was the first settler on 
						the Krobo mountain and in fact it was he who gave land 
						to the Manya and Yilo Krobos when the latter met him on 
						the Krobo mountain. Obviously because the textbook 
						writers version adversely affected the co-defendant's 
						traditional history his counsel contended as one of the 
						grounds of appeal that the learned trial judge erred in 
						basing his finding on extraneous matters, an apparent 
						reference to the account from the history books. I 
						consider it important to stress that it does not stand 
						to reason for a party who tenders a document or calls 
						oral evidence on a matter in issue to urge the court to 
						accept that part of the document or oral evidence which 
						favours part or the whole of his case but to reject 
						another part of the same document or oral evidence which 
						supports the case of his opponent, because equity frows 
						upon unfair treatment in the conduct of human affairs. 
						For this reason, the submission that the judge erred was 
						untenable.&nbsp; Within the scope of the principle in 
						Adjeibi-Kojo v. Bonesie (supra) the Jackson report was a 
						fact established by the evidence. Quite apart from the 
						Jackson report the trial judge was right in using the 
						history book account as a matter for judicial notice 
						pursuant to paragraph 9 of the Evidence Decree 1975 
						(NRCD 323)&nbsp; and page 57 of the Commentary on the 
						Evidence Decree 1975 and, more importantly, to Order 37 
						rule 56 of the High court (Civil Procedure) Rules 1954 
						LN 140A which states as follows:-</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Order 37 rule 56: On 
						matters of public history, literature, science, or art, 
						the court may refer, it shall think fit, for the 
						purposes of evidence, to such published books, maps, or 
						charts as the court shall consider to be authority on 
						the subject to which they relate&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This procedure takes 
						its sustenance from the rule of evidence that a court 
						may and can take judicial notice of notorious facts- 
						here public history.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Now the identity of the 
						land subject-matter of the litigation takes its turn for 
						consideration.&nbsp; There is no gainsaying the fact that 
						proof of the identity of a land to which a plaintiff or 
						defendant-counterclaimant claims a declaration of title, 
						when in dispute on the evidence, must be positively 
						discharged by the claimant if he should succeed in his 
						action or counterclaim as the case may be: see Buruwa v. 
						Ogwahola (1938) 4 WACA 159; Sasraku v. Ahiaku (1942) 8 
						WACA 76 at 82 and Sowa v. Amahire (133) II NLR 82 (FC) 
						Page 85, all cited by counsel for the respondent and all 
						apposite to the law on the subject. The rational behind 
						the insistence on strict proof of the identity of land 
						was stated by the Supreme Court of the First Republic in 
						the case of Anane v. Donkor (1965) GLR 188 at 192 where 
						the court speaking through Ollenu JSC (as he then was) 
						said:-</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Where a court grants 
						declaration of title to land or makes an order for 
						injunction in respect of land, the land the subject 
						matter of that declaration should be clearly identified 
						so that an order for possession can be executed without 
						difficulty, and also if the order for injunction is 
						violated the person in contempt can be published. If the 
						boundaries of such land are not established, a judgment 
						or order of the court will be in vain. Again a judgment 
						for declaration of title to the land should operate as 
						res judicata to prevent the parties from relitigating 
						the same issues in respect of the identical subject 
						matter, but it cannot so operate unless the subject 
						matter thereof is clearly identified. For these reasons 
						a claim for declaration of title or an order for 
						injunction must always fail if the plaintiff fails to 
						establish positively the identity of the land to which 
						he claims title, subject matter of the suit&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instant case, 
						the plaintiff who claims that his land is situate in a 
						place called Okwenya within the Manya Krobo Traditional 
						Area has clearly identified it on a Deed of Conveyance 
						duly registered at the lands Registry at Koforidua.&nbsp; He 
						contends that the Okwenya land does not form part of 
						Akuse lands as contended by the co-defendant who says 
						that Akuse land extend to Okwenya. The Jackson report on 
						which the co-defendant relied did not state the extent 
						of 'Akuse Land'. In such circumstances a legal issue 
						arises as to the party who carries the burden of 
						persuasion. Clearly, it is the co-defendant who asserts 
						the affirmative of the issue: see Amah v. Kaifio (1959) 
						GLR 23 and Edah v. Hussey (1989-90) 1 GLR 359 CA. In 
						Amah v. Kaifio Ollenu J (as he then was) stated at page 
						25 of the report that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The principle of law 
						is that the burden of proof rests upon the party who 
						would fail if no evidence at all, or no more evidence, 
						as the case may be, were given on either side - ie it 
						rests before evidence is gone into upon the party 
						asserting the affirmative of the issue; and it rests 
						after evidence is gone into upon the the party against 
						whom the tribunal, at the time the question arises, 
						would give judgement if no further evidence were adduced 
						&quot;(Phipson on Evidence 7th edition at page 31; and see 
						Abrath v. North Eastern Railway Company (1896) 1 Q6D 189 
						and 196)&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Applying the foregoing 
						principle of law which we fully endorse, it is 
						significant to note that after evidence had been gone 
						into, it was clear that the plaintiff had emerged the 
						victor on the traditional evidence and was so adjudged, 
						rightly in our view by the trial judge. Figuratively 
						speaking, the plaintiff at that juncture had secured a 
						comfortable place on Okwenya land on Manya Krobo 
						Traditional Area leaving the co-defendant on the Akuse 
						lands to prove that Akuse lands stretched or engulfed 
						Okwenya. This was the much needed further evidence which 
						the co-defendant ought to have offered to avert judgment 
						against him handed down by the tribunal which in fact 
						occurred. This appraisal of the issues that arose from 
						the evidence coincided fortuitously with a vital part of 
						the submissions made by counsel for the first defendant. 
						For at page 7 of Counsel's Statement of case he states 
						as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;28.&nbsp; There is a 
						serious conflict on the question of whether the &quot;res 
						litigiosa&quot; which is at Okwenya is part and parcel of 
						Akuse lands. This conflict could have been easily 
						resolved if the trial judge had ordered for a plan of 
						the land in dispute and Akuse lands to be drawn.&nbsp; In the 
						case of Anane &amp; others v. Donkor and Kwarteng &amp; Another 
						v. Donkor and Another (Consolidated) (1965) GLR 188 the 
						Supreme Court held that a claim for declaration of title 
						to land or for an order for injunction must always fail, 
						if the plaintiff fails to establish positively the 
						identity of the land claimed&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my view, this 
						concession on the part of Counsel for the first 
						defendant typifies his innate commitment to the ethics 
						of the legal profession which insists upon honesty, 
						sincerity and truth as the only guarantees to true 
						justice for litigants in our courts. To demonstrate my 
						sympathy with counsel as he agonises over the failure of 
						the trial judge to order a survey, I would first refer 
						to the case of Sowa v. Amachinea (supra) courtesy 
						counsel for the plaintiff where the court went to the 
						extreme to say that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;It is impossible to 
						make a declaration of title without a plan to which such 
						declaration can be tied.&quot; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I would say that a 
						plan, although very helpful, has never been the only 
						mode of proving the identity of land although there is 
						no gainsaying the fact that it is an improvement upon a 
						visit to the locus in quo which confirms the rule 
						'seeing is believing'. Be that as it may, it seems to me 
						clear that in the instant case it is too late in the day 
						for the defendants to pass the buck to the trial judge 
						and, as it were, to make him a scapegoat for the initial 
						omission, of the defendants.&nbsp; The defendant filed a 
						counterclaim but he subsequently discontinued. The 
						co-defendant did not file any counterclaim. If the idea 
						of a counterclaim had dawned on the co-defendant he 
						would have realised that his burden of proof was going 
						to be the same as that of the plaintiff on the totality 
						of the evidence. The co-defendant would have felt 
						compelled to prove that &quot;Akuse lands&quot; included Okwenya. 
						Instead of brazing himself on equal terms with the 
						plaintiff, the co-defendant chose to hide behind the 
						facade of an old rule enunciated in the case of 
						Kodilinye v Odu (19) 2 WACA page 337 and, as it were, 
						adopted a wait and see stance to see the plaintiff fail 
						so that he would get judgment on the principle in 
						Kodilinye case that the plaintiff must succeed on the 
						strength of his own case and not on any weakness of the 
						defence case. This is borne out by the passage at page 7 
						of the statement of case filed by counsel for the first 
						appellant where he reproduces in extenso the dictum of 
						the diction of Webber CJ in Kodilinye v Odu (supra) 
						approved by the Supreme Court of the First Republic in 
						Serwah v Kesse (1960) GLR 227 at 228 as follows:-</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The onus lies on the 
						plaintiff to satisfy the court that he is entitled on 
						the evidence brought by him to a declaration of title.&nbsp; 
						The plaintiff in this case must rely on the strength of 
						his own case and not on the weakness of the defendant's 
						case.&nbsp; If this onus is not discharged, the weakness of 
						the defendant's case will not help him and the proper 
						judgment is for the defendant.&nbsp; Such a judgment decrees 
						no title to the defendant, he not having sought the 
						declaration. So if the whole evidence in the case be 
						conflicting and somewhat confused, and there is little 
						to choose between the rival traditional stories the 
						plaintiff fails in the decree he seeks, and judgment 
						must be entered for the defendant. Per Webber, CJ in 
						Kodilinye v Odu (2 W.A.C.A. at page 337).&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Like other fundamental 
						principles of law, the rule in Kodilinye v Odu (supra) 
						has had its fair share of transformation and 
						vicissitudes, however adamant or conservative judges 
						have stood against its change. Kodilinye dominated the 
						legal horizon for several decades until the enactment of 
						the Evidence Decree 1975 (NRCD 323), section 11 (1) to 
						(4) thereof. Despite the enactment of the decree which 
						abolished the rule in Kodilinye that a plaintiff in an 
						action for a declaration of title must prove his case 
						with the degree of proof required in criminal cases in 
						favour of proof on the balance of probabilities, 
						conservative judges His Lordship Mr. Justice Francoise 
						JSC (as he then was) being the most vocal, still stuck 
						to the old rule. Thus, despite the firm decision of the 
						Supreme Court in the case of Odametey v Clocuh and 
						Another (1989-90) 1 GLR 14 which disapproved of 
						Kodilinye on the 8th March 1989 Francoise JSC (as he 
						then was presiding with Ampiah and Lamptey JJA) in a 
						subsequent case before the Court of Appeal, Banga and 
						Others v Djanie and Another (1989-90) 1 GLR 510 at 519 
						stated as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The principle (that 
						the plaintiff should succeed on the strength of his 
						case) has for several decades been the fulcrum for 
						determination of ownership in land matters in our 
						courts. In recent times a dangerous trend has been 
						erupting equating this burden with the normal burden in 
						civil cases in measuring success by a balance of 
						probabilities. In my view the requirement of a higher 
						burden of proof in land matters cannot be whittled away 
						by glosses on the principle. Suffice it to emphasise 
						that a high measure of proof is necessary to sustain 
						victory in a plaintiff seeking a declaration of the 
						title to land.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Needless to emphasise 
						with the greatest respect to the eminent judges the 
						decision in Banga v. Jainie (supra) must be jettisoned 
						as having been given per incuriam by the Court of Appeal 
						in so far as it proceeded in flagrant defiance of an 
						earlier decision of the Supreme Court in Odametey v 
						Clocuh (supra). It is gratifying, however, that there 
						can no longer be any lingering doubt about the demise of 
						Kodilinye as the recent supreme Court case of Adwabeng 
						v. Domfeh (1996-97) SC GLR 660 nailed its coffin by a 
						unanimous decision thus laying finally to rest the 
						controversy.&nbsp; The last straw that broke the camel's back 
						in that case was holding (3) which is as follows:-</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(3) Sections 11 (4) 
						and 12 of the Evidence Decree 1975 (NRCD 323) (which 
						came into force on 1 October 1979) have clearly provided 
						that the standard of proof in all civil actions was 
						proof by preponderance of probabilities - no exceptions 
						were made. In the light of the provisions of the 
						Evidence Decree, cases which had held that proof in 
						titles to land required proof beyond reasonable no 
						longer represented the present state of the law.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the balance of the 
						probabilities, this court is not in anyway whatsoever 
						confronted with any difficulty in affirming the holding 
						of the learned trial judge that the plaintiff proved 
						title to the land by a preponderance of evidence because 
						as I have endeavored to demonstrate, the failure on the 
						part of the co-defendant to discharge the evidential 
						burden that shifted to him on the issue of whether Akuse 
						lands included Okwenya inured advantageously to the 
						strength of the plaintiff's case. This is typical 
						example of a situation which Taylor JSC (as he then was) 
						alluded to in Odametey v Clocuh &amp; Another (supra) where 
						he stated at page 8 of the report that: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Per Taylor JSC: The 
						mechanical application of this so called principle (in 
						Kodilinye case) in actions for declaration of title - 
						the genesis of which is traceable to the (dictum) of 
						Webber CJ in Kodilinye v Odu that &quot;the plaintiff must 
						rely on the strength of his own case and not rely on the 
						weakness of the defendant's case&quot; should be deprecated. 
						If the dictum of Webber CJ stated over half a century 
						ago supports the proposition that a weakness in the 
						defendant's case in an action for declaration of title 
						must not be considered in evaluating the strength of the 
						plaintiff's case no matter the plaintiff's case then the 
						dictum is now no more true of the legal position in 
						modern Ghana, at least since the coming into force of 
						the Evidence Decree 1975. If there was ever a doubt 
						about the true position ........ then NRCD 323 has now 
						definitely cleared all possible doubts.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;In the course of the 
						trial a number of judgments were tendered by the parties 
						on either side.&nbsp; The probative value or the legal effect 
						of such judgments is fully well-known. They may serve to 
						oust the jurisdiction of the court upon a plea of 
						estoppe per rem judicatam: see Ababio v Kanga, 1 WACA 
						253 in the sense that once a court has adjudicated over 
						a subject matter between parties that matter cannot be 
						relitigated between the same parties or their privies. 
						Previous judgments may also serve as evidence of acts of 
						ownership or possession as the case may be; Akoto v 
						Agyeman (1962) 1 GLR 524. Upon examination of the 
						various judgments I was not satisfied that they in 
						anyway helped resolve the thorny issue of whether 'Akuse 
						lands' as stated in the Jackson report included to 
						Okwenya. All the judgments tendered on behalf of the 
						co-defendant describe boundaries up to the Okwe stream 
						and no mention anywhere is made of Okwenya. Even in the 
						instant case nowhere in their pleadings did the 
						defendant or the co-defendant make mention of Okwenya. 
						On the other hand, however, the plaintiff and his 
						grantors had no other word in their mouth than Okwenya. 
						In his statement of case counsel, for the co-defendant 
						stated at page 21 thereof certain matters which did not 
						appear at the trial in the testimonies of the witnesses 
						and which in my view did not resolve the issue raised by 
						Counsel for the first defendant in his statement of case 
						about whether Akuse land stretched to Okwenya.&nbsp; The 
						statement is as follows:-</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;In all the cases which 
						have been litigated in the courts from 1910 onwards, the 
						Akuse lands have been described as extending to the Okwe 
						Stream. Okwenya is merely the name of a village near the 
						Okwe Stream. The name Okwenya simply means before or in 
						front of the Okwe. A separate entity Okwenya land never 
						featured in Jackson's enquiry. The evidence of the Konor 
						of Many Krobo before Jackson quoted on earlier in this 
						statement recognised Akuse land as extending from Akuse 
						to Lomen.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my view the most 
						reasonable and safest construction that one can place on 
						counsel's statement is that the Konor's evidence rather 
						confirmed the theory of a separate entity called Okwenya. 
						The Konor must be deemed to have known his villages in 
						his traditional area. That the plaintiff's grantors 
						treated Okwenya as a separate entity is borne out by the 
						following evidence during cross-examination of pw 1 
						(vide pages 7 &amp; 8 of counsel for first defendant's 
						statement of case).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q&nbsp; Between 1967-75 the 
						mother of co-defendant litigated the family land 
						including the area in dispute at the High Court and had 
						judgment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A&nbsp; She litigated over 
						Akuse land and not over Okwenya land.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">But there is yet 
						another more significant portion of the evidence which 
						reveals a fundamental misconception of the real burden 
						of the action instituted by the plaintiff. It is the 
						cross-examination of pw 1 at p 137 of the record:-</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp; The co-defendant 
						has put up a house opposite the land you claim belongs 
						to your family and he did so without a challenge from 
						Nana Sasraku?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A&nbsp;&nbsp; Nana Sasraku was 
						old. I also travelled. When I returned I instituted an 
						action against him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp; You have not sued 
						the co-defendant in respect of that house.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp; The house is on the 
						disputed land and if I win this case I will get that 
						land. I granted the land to some people. The 
						co-defendant trespassed on that land. The people have 
						sued him at the Somanya Court and I have joined that 
						suit&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is rather strange 
						that the Akromuase family did not find it prudent to 
						join this litigation as co-plaintiffs to litigate title 
						to the land part of which they granted to the plaintiff 
						on the basis of the traditional history they led. If 
						they had done so a larger area which pw 1 now talks 
						about in his cross-examination could have been 
						adjudicated one way or the other in this suit to avoid 
						multiplicity of suits in the future. I do not know what 
						explanation counsel for the plaintiff had for not 
						advising this approach to the case. The subject matter 
						of this case for the purposes of any order decreeing 
						title to land is the land described by the plaintiff in 
						his writ of summons against the defendant. As far as 
						that land is concerned the judgment of the court below 
						is unassailable. An attempt was made to fault the 
						validity of the Deed of Conveyance registered in the 
						name of the plaintiff but I found no substance in the 
						allegation. The defendant was in law deemed to have had 
						constructive notice of the plaintiff's title to the land 
						because the registration constituted a notice to the 
						whole world (see section 25(1) of the Land Registry Act 
						1962 (Act 122).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In addition to the two 
						cases cited by the learned trial judge namely, Wilson v 
						Hart (1866) 1 Ch App 467 where Jurner LJ stated:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Generally speaking, a 
						purchaser is bound to inquire into the title of his 
						vendor and will be affected with notice of what appears 
						upon the title if he does not so inquire&quot;,</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I would refer to the 
						local decision of our Court of Appeal in the case of 
						Boateng v Dwinfour (1979) GLR 360 at page 366 where the 
						Court of Appeal supported the principle that a purchaser 
						who fails to make prudent enquiry is deemed to have had 
						notice of existing title. On the facts of the case, I
