												JUDGMENT</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												ASARE-KORANG, JA.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is an appeal by the 
												Defendant/Appellant against the 
												decision of the Sefwi Wiawso 
												High Court wherein judgment was 
												entered in favour of the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent who had 
												sued the Defendant/Appellant for 
												a declaration of title to a 
												piece of land situate on Sefwi 
												Ahwiaa Stool Land, damages for 
												trespass and an Order of 
												perpetual injunction restraining 
												the Defendant, her against, 
												workmen, family members etc. 
												from entering the said land.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In this statement of claim the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent described 
												the land as being at a place 
												known as Afukaakrom and bounded 
												by one Kofi Mensah&#8217;s secondary 
												forest land: Kwabena Gyabeng&#8217;s 
												(deceased) secondary forest land 
												and the land of Kwasi Ahia.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In his evidence in chief, the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent stated his 
												boundary owners as his late 
												granduncle Kwabena Gyabeng, 
												Kwasi Aha and the Aboabo stream 
												and he added that the land of 
												the late Kofi Mensah was on the 
												opposite side of the Aboabo 
												stream.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Plaintiff/Respondent 
												testified that he acquired a 
												piece of forest land at Sefwi 
												Ahwiaa at a place called Kwasi 
												Afukaakrom and planted Cocoa 
												thereon.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Subsequently the Cocoa trees 
												withered and apparently died as 
												the land turned into a secondary 
												forest. Portions of the land 
												have been reactivated Cocoa and 
												oil palm trees thereon. There is 
												an uncultivated portion of the 
												land which is the subject-matter 
												of this appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The boundary owners stated by 
												the Plaintiff/Respondent in his 
												evidence were Kwabena Gyabeng, 
												Kwasi Aha and the Aboabo stream. 
												He said further that he shared 
												boundary with one Kofi Mensah 
												whose land was on the opposite 
												side of the Aboabo stream. The 
												boundary owners, Kofi Mensah and 
												Kwasi Aha had died and their 
												respective relatives had taken 
												possession of their land. In 
												support of his case the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent called two 
												boundary owners. The first 
												witness was the customary 
												successor of Kwabena Gyabeng and 
												the second was the granddaughter 
												of Kwame Mensah. It seems it was 
												this Kwame Mensah that the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent named as 
												Kofi Mensah.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The plaintiff/Respondent&#8217;s first 
												witness stated that he used to 
												assist his predecessor Gyabeng 
												on his land and in doing so he 
												saw the Plaintiff/Respondent 
												also working on his land.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In her evidence, the Plaintiff&#8217;s 
												second witness stated that the 
												boundary owner Kwame Mensah 
												(deceased) was her grandfather 
												and she was in possession of her 
												grandfather&#8217;s land. She 
												asserted, in effect, that the 
												Aboabo stream lies between her 
												land and Plaintiff/Respondent&#8217;s 
												Land.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Defendant/Appellant in her 
												testimony described the land in 
												dispute as situate at 
												Mayebonikrom on Ahwiaa stool 
												land. She insisted that the land 
												in dispute was first cultivated 
												in its virgin state by her 
												brother Kwasi Asante who granted 
												part of the land to one Asua, 
												Plaintiff/Respondent&#8217;s paternal 
												uncle and it was Asua who 
												brought the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent&#8217;s father 
												also known as Kwasi Afukaa on to 
												the land. That is why, according 
												to the Defendant/Appellant, the 
												land is called Kwasi Afukaakrom 
												but the real name is 
												Mayebonikrom.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Defendant/Appellant stated 
												that the land shares boundaries 
												with Kwabena Agyebeng, Opanin 
												Nyansa and the Aboaboka stream 
												but in cross-examination, she 
												declared that the Aboaboka 
												stream is far away from the land 
												in dispute. She relied on a CDR 
												arbitration report (Exhibit) 
												between her and the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent&#8217;s nephew, 
												one Brown, over the disputed 
												area in which one Kwabena SOR, 
												the Plaintiff/Respondent&#8217;s 
												paternal cousin gave evidence on 
												her behalf.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This arbitration report was not 
												filed as part of the record of 
												this appeal but it makes no 
												difference that it was not 
												because it was rejected by the 
												trial court in its judgment and 
												by Counsel for both parties 
												herein in their statements of 
												case as being of no relevance in 
												deciding this case one way or 
												the other.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In her statement of Defence the 
												Defendant/Appellant gave the 
												boundaries of the land as Agya 
												Nyansa and Kwabena Gyabeng&#8217;s 
												land marked by a footpath. This 
												is in contrast with her 
												testimony on oath where she gave 
												the boundaries as Agyabeng, 
												Opanin Nyansa and the Aboaboka 
												stream which she later reversed 
												when she stated that the 
												Aboaboka stream is far away from 
												the land in dispute.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Defendant/Appellant called 
												no witness at the trial.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Pronouncing judgment in favour 
												of the Plaintiff/Respondent, the 
												learned trial judge cited among 
												other cases the decision in 
												LAMPTEY (alias NKPA) vrs. FANYIE 
												(1988-89) CLR SC (1) holding (1) 
												of which reads:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;. . . . On general principles 
												it was the duty of the Plaintiff 
												to prove his case. However, when 
												on a particular issue he had led 
												some evidence then the burden 
												would shift to the defendant to 
												lead sufficient evidence to tip 
												the scales in his favour. The 
												defendant would win only if, he 
												was able to do that . . . &#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the basis of this principle 
												the learned trial judge in the 
												instant case held as follow. &#8220;It 
												is surprising, to say the least, 
												why the Defendant, in the face 
												of overwhelming odds, failed to 
												call a single witness to come 
												and testify for her. Generally 
												in a civil action, a party with 
												the burden of producing evidence 
												must produce sufficient evidence 
												to require the judge to weigh 
												the evidence before deciding 
												(see CROSS, EVIDENCE 3rd De. 
												1974) The test for measuring 
												sufficiency of evidence to meet 
												the burden of Producing evidence 
												is that the evidence is 
												sufficient if a reasonable mind 
												would hold that the existence of 
												the fact in issue was more 
												probable than its non-existence. 
												(see EVIDENCE DECREE, 1975&#8212;NRCD 
												323, Section 11(4)&#8230;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The present case shows that the 
												onus of proof lies on the 
												balance of Probabilities as 
												found in Section 11(4) of the 
												EVIDENCE DECREE, 1975, (NRCD 
												323). The analyses of the facts 
												and evidence in this judgment 
												are sufficient to tilt the 
												balance of probabilities in 
												favour of the Plaintiff and it 
												is the considered view of this 
												court that the Plaintiff has 
												established his case by the 
												preponderance of facts and 
												evidence adduced before me and I 
												hereby decree that the Plaintiff 
												is entitled to the reliefs he is 
												seeking.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the instant appeal against 
												the decision of the learned 
												trial judge, three grounds of 
												appeal were filed by the 
												Defendant/Appellant but only one 
												consistent ground was argued by 
												Counsel for the 
												Defendant/Appellant in his 
												Statement of Case, namely:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The judgment was against the 
												weight of evidence.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel for the 
												Defendant/Appellant then 
												proceeded to review and weigh 
												the evidence led by the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent and his 
												witnesses and then examined the 
												law which he considered was 
												applicable to those pieces of 
												evidence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The submission made by Counsel 
												for the Defendant/Appellant was 
												that from the evidence led 
												before the learned trial judge, 
												it was clear that the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent was not 
												able to prove the boundaries of 
												his land.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												According to counsel the grounds 
												for saying so were that Kofi 
												Attah, the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent&#8217;s first 
												witness alleged in his 
												evidence-in-chief that as 
												successor of Opanin Agyabeng he 
												inherited the land of Opanin 
												Agyabeng which land shares 
												boundaries with the land of the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent and Agya 
												Mensah and Kwasi Aha.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Then in cross-examination, Kofi 
												Attah recanted and stated:
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;I now say my land does not 
												share boundary with Kwasi and 
												Agya Mensah.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Again whilst the second witness 
												for the Plaintiff/Respondent 
												claimed that her land shares 
												boundaries with 
												Plaintiff/Respondent&#8217;s land and 
												the land of Kwame Mensah and 
												Opanin Kwasi Aha, she explained 
												during cross-examination that:
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The Plaintiff&#8217;s land is on side 
												of the stream Aboabo. My land 
												and that of Aha are on the 
												opposite bank of this stream.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The significance of this piece 
												of evidence, Counsel submitted, 
												was that the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent does not 
												share boundary with his second 
												witness as the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent had himself 
												given evidence that the late 
												Kofi Mensah&#8217;s land is on the 
												opposite bank of Aboabo stream.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel further submitted that 
												because the indorsement on the 
												Plaintiff/ Respondent&#8217;s writ of 
												summons was at variance with his 
												own evidence and that of his 
												second witness, the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent was 
												uncertain about his boundary 
												owners, and on the authority of 
												Bedy vrs. Agbi (1972) 2 GLR 238 
												at 241 and Nyikplorkpo vrs. 
												Agbodotor (1987-88) 1 GLR at p. 
												171, the failure of the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent to prove 
												his boundaries and the limits of 
												his land was disastrous to his 
												claim.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The basic rule is that &#8220;an 
												appeal shall be by way of 
												rehearing and in AKUFO ADDO vrs. 
												CATHLINE (1992) 1 GLR 377 at p. 
												403, the Supreme Court held that 
												where an appellant appealed 
												against a judgment on the 
												general ground that &#8220;the 
												judgment was against the weight 
												of evidence&#8221;, the Appellate 
												Court had jurisdiction to 
												examine the totality of the 
												evidence before it and come to 
												its own decision on the admitted 
												and undisputed facts.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appeal herein being based on 
												the general ground, it is open 
												to this court to look at the 
												whole of the evidence given at 
												the trial, which in fact is the 
												approach taken by the 
												Defendant/Appellant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In my opinion, there was no 
												uncertainty about the boundaries 
												given by the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent and his 
												witnesses.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Plaintiff/Respondent 
												consistently gave his boundary 
												owners as Opanin Kwabena 
												Agyabeng, Kwasi Aha and Kofi 
												Mensah, with the Aboabo stream 
												lying between his land and that 
												of Kofi Mensah.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I think it was a strain on 
												language when the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent stated in 
												his evidence-in-chief that the 
												Aboabo stream was one of hiossic 
												boundary owners, because the 
												Aboabo stream cannot by any 
												stretch be a boundary owner. A 
												stream may only be a boundary 
												feature and no more.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The only proper and consistent 
												interpretation I place on the 
												evidence of the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent and his 
												second witness is that the 
												Aboabo stream is a boundary 
												feature separating and 
												distinguishing his land from the 
												land of Kwame Mensah and Kwasi 
												Aha who are on the other bank of 
												the Aboabo stream.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel for the Defendant also 
												argued that because the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent&#8217;s first 
												witness claimed that he shared 
												boundaries with Kwasi Aha and 
												Agya Mensah and later back 
												pedaled that he did not, to the 
												extent that the witness changed 
												his story, the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent did not 
												know his boundaries.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In my view, this is only an 
												inconsistency in the evidence of 
												the Plaintiff/Respondent&#8217;s first 
												witness and is not a departure 
												from the claim or allegation by 
												the Plaintiff/Respondent that 
												his land shared boundary with 
												the land of his second witness.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Furthermore the fact that the 
												land of the first witness of 
												Plaintiff/Respondent is not 
												bounded by the land of Kwasi Aha 
												and Agya Mensah in no way 
												conflicts with this evidence 
												that he shares boundary with the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What the trial court was called 
												upon to decide in this case was 
												strictly not a boundary dispute 
												for when asked whether the 
												Aboabo stream would be found at 
												the area in dispute, the 
												Defendant/Appellant while being 
												cross examined replied:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;A: It is far away from the land 
												in dispute.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Further asked in 
												cross-examination whether the a 
												Plaintiff/Respondent&#8217;s boundary 
												is marked by Aboabo stream the 
												Defendant/Appellant answered:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;A: Kwasi Afukaa (Plaintiff) has 
												got no land in the area. I do 
												not share boundary with him.&#8221; 
												(Emphasis mine).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What the trial court had to 
												determine, therefore, was a 
												clear cut dispute involving 
												ownership of and title to land.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In circumstances where the 
												controversy between the parties 
												is not strictly concerned with 
												boundaries but where a 
												particular piece of land is 
												situated, it has been held that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;where a party was claiming a 
												declaration of title to land the 
												Defendants gave evidence showing 
												that they themselves were not 
												boundary owners to the land 
												being claimed and on the 
												evidence, the controversy was 
												not strictly a boundary dispute 
												but where the land was situated, 
												it would be irrelevant to call 
												all the boundary owners to 
												testify. What was important in 
												such a case was the traditional 
												evidence as to how the parties 
												or their respective ancestors 
												acquired the land in its virgin 
												state,&#8230;.....</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												acts of ownership and evidence 
												of people who knew the facts who 
												could be either boundary owners 
												or farmers on the land.&#8221;</span></p>

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In this appeal since the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent maintained 
												that he and members of his 
												family were working on the 
												disputed land and called 
												witnesses who claimed to have 
												seen him cultivating the land in 
												dispute, when the 
												Defendant/Appellant testified 
												that the land was virgin forest 
												owned by his brother Kwasi 
												Asante who first cultivated the 
												land in its virgin state and 
												that Kwasi Asante gave part of 
												the land to the 
												Plaintiff/Respondents

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												That burden was not discharged
