						<font face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US">ADUAMA OSEI J.A 
						This is an appeal against a judgment of the High Court. 
						Tema, dated the 23rd of February, 2007, in which the 
						High Court held that having agreed to carry the 
						Plaintiff/Respondent's goods from the Port at Tema to 
						the Tema Free Zones enclave for reward, the 
						Defendant/Appellant was under an obligation to carry the 
						goods to its destination &quot;safely, carefully and 
						securely&quot; and that, having failed to do so, the 
						Defendant/Appellant was liable to pay to the 
						Plaintiff/Respondent as special damages the sum of 
						US$24,937.75 or its cedi equivalent, being the repair 
						cost of the Plaintiff/Respondent's goods damaged in the 
						course of carriage. The action that has given rise to 
						this appeal was commenced by a Writ of Summons issued on 
						30th November, 2005, and indorsed for the following 
						reliefs: &quot;(i) A declaration that the defendant being a 
						common carrier is liable to compensate plaintiff for any 
						loss or damage suffered by plaintiff as a result of 
						defendant's failure to transport the goods entrusted to 
						it by plaintiff to their destination carefully, safely 
						and securely. &quot;(ii) A declaration that having failed to 
						transport the goods entrusted to it by plaintiff to 
						their destination carefully, safely and securely 
						plaintiff is entitled to claim compensation from 
						defendant all losses and damages suffered by plaintiff 
						as a result of defendant's aforesaid failure on a full 
						indemnity basis. (iii) Recovery of the sum of $24,937.75 
						or its cedi equivalent being the financial loss incurred 
						by plaintiff as a result of the damage caused to the 
						goods entrusted to defendant by plaintiff for purposes 
						of careful, safe and secure transportation to their 
						destination. &quot;(iv) Interest oil aforesaid sum of 
						$24,937.75 from 27/05/05 being the date on which 
						Harlequin international (Gh) Ltd debited plaintiff's 
						account with the aforesaid amount. &quot;(v) Costs on a full 
						indemnity basis.&quot; In the Statement of Claim accompanying 
						the Writ of Summons, the Plaintiff/Respondent described 
						the Defendant/Appellant as a common carrier and alleged 
						that on or about the 16th of May, 2005, in the 
						performance of its business as a freight forwarder and 
						acting on behalf of a company called Bredoro Shaw Pipe 
						Coaters Limited, it contracted the Defendant/Appellant 
						to transport various goods, including conveyor rails, 
						belts and other heavy duty accessories from the Port at 
						Tema to the Free Zones enclave also at Tema for reward. 
						The Plaintiff/Respondent contended in the Statement of 
						Claim that, beyond its contractual obligation, the 
						Defendant/Appellant also owed a legal obligation to 
						convey the goods to their destination &quot;carefully, safely 
						and securely&quot;. It was the case of the 
						Plaintiff/Respondent, however, that the 
						Defendant/Appellant failed to meet its said obligation, 
						with the result that some of the goods fell off the 
						Defendant/Appellant's vehicle in the course of carriage 
						and got damaged. According to the Plaintiff/Respondent, 
						it incurred a cost of $24,937.75 in order to have the 
						damaged goods repaired. The Plaintiff/Respondent 
						contended that the Defendant/Appellant was liable to 
						compensate it for the loss and damage it had suffered. 
						The Plaintiff/Respondent stated that it had sued 
						claiming the reliefs indorsed on the Writ of Summons 
						because the Defendant/Appellant had denied liability and 
						had refused to pay compensation fur the damage suffered 
						in spite of demands made. The Defendant/Appellant 
						however considered that the Plaintiff/Respondent was not 
						entitled to any of the reliefs claimed in the Suit. In 
						its Statement of Defence filed on 21st December, ,2005, 
						the Defendant/Appellant denied that it was a common 
						carrier, and contended that it was a private carrier and 
						that it agreed to carry the Plaintiff/Respondent's goods 
						on specific terms. According to the Defendant/Appellant, 
						one of the key terms of the contract was that the 
						Plaintiff/Respondent would be responsible for the 
						loading of the flat rack on which the goods were packed 
						onto the Defendant/Appellant's trucks. According to the 
						Defendant/Appellant, it played no role in the loading of 
						the container onto the trucks and that the damage to the 
						goods during their carriage was neither caused by its 
						negligence nor the negligence of any of its employees. 
						The Defendant/Appellant contended in the Statement of 
						Defence that the damage was caused because the goods 
						were either negligently loaded onto the container, or 
						sufficient care was not exercised in their loading. The 
						responsibility for the loading was however the 
						Plaintiff's and the Defendant therefore bore no 
						responsibility for any damage to the goods.In its 
						application for directions filed on 24th January, 2006, 
						the Plaintiff/Respondent raised five issues for 
						determination, and the Defendant/Appellant also filed 
						five additional issues. Both the issues raised by the 
						Plaintiff/Respondent and those filed by the 
						Defendant/Appellant were set down as issues for trial by 
						the trial Court. and the ten issues are set out below: i) 
						Whether or not the defendant owes plaintiff a duty to 
						transport its goods to their destination safely and 
						securely. ii) Whether or not defendant's obligation to 
						carry plaintiff's goods to their destination safely and 
						securely is extinguished or diminished by its alleged 
						non paritcipation in the process of loading the goods. 
						iii) Whether or not the defendant breached its duty to 
						plaintiff when it failed to carry plaintiff's goods to 
						their destination safely and securely. iv) Whether or 
						not the defendant is liable to pay to the plaintiff 
						damages for breach of its duty to plaintiff to carry 
						plaintiff's goods to their destination safely and 
						securely. v) Whether or not the damage to plaintiff's 
						goods resulted from defendant's negligence. vi) Whether 
						the defendant is a common carrier or a private carrier. 
						vii) Whether or not the goods were already packed onto 
						the flat rack container by the plaintiff before the 
						loading of the goods onto the defendant's trucks was 
						done. viii) Whether or not the plaintiff failed to 
						properly pack the goods and secure same on the fiat rack 
						container. ix) Whether the goods skidded off the flat 
						rack container as a result of its negligent packing or 
						the container skidded off the defendant's trucks. x) 
						Whether or not the damage to the goods was caused by the 
						insufficient and negligent packing of same on the flat 
						rack container by the plaintiff. The trial Court 
						considered that the issues numbered (I), (ii), (iii), 
						(vi), (viii), (ix) and (x) above, together raised the 
						important questions of the duty of care owed by the 
						Defendant/Appellant to the Plaintiff/Respondent, and the 
						manner in which the loading or packing of the goods was 
						done. The trial Court therefore dealt with the said 
						issues together. After considering the issues in the 
						light of the evidence, the trial Court came to the 
						conclusion that the Defendant/Appellant was liable for 
						the damage caused to the goods and entered judgment for 
						the Plaintiff/Respondent on all the reliefs claimed, 
						except relief (iv), by which the Plaintiff/Respondent 
						claimed interest on the sum of $24,937.75 which the 
						Plaintiff/Respondent alleged was the cost at which the 
						damaged goods were repaired. Not satisfied with the 
						judgment of the trial Court, the Defendant/Appellant has 
						appealed against the same to this Court on two grounds, 
						which are that: a) The learned judge erred in coming to 
						a conclusion that the DefendantlAppellant is liable to 
						Plaintiff for damage to Plaintiff's goods, having regard 
						to the evidence adduced, and b) The learned judge erred 
						in not considering the fact that the Defendant was a 
						private carrier which was a fundamental issue in this 
						case. Not satisfied with the trial Court's refusal to 
						award it interest on the sum of $24,937.75, being the 
						cost of repairing the damaged goods, the Respondent has 
						also filed a cross-appeal asking this Court to reverse 
						the trial Court's decision refusing to award it 
						interest. The sole ground of the cross-appeal is that 
						'Shaving regard to all the circumstances of the case the 
						trial judge ought not have refused the claim for 
						interest on the sum of $24,937.75 or its cedi equivalent 
						from 27/05/05 when plaintiff incurred the financial loss 
						as a result of defendant's negligence to the date of 
						judgment.&quot; The judgment appealed against is at pages 123 
						to 132 of the Appeal Record and the Notice of Appeal is 
						at pages 138 and 139 of the Record. The 
						Plaintiff/Respondent's cross-appeal can also be found at 
						pages 140 and 141 of the Record. In this judgment, the 
						Plaintiff/Respondent is referred to as &quot;the Respondent&quot; 
						and the Defendant/Appellant is referred to as &quot;the 
						Appellant&quot;. Under ground (a) of this appeal, the 
						Appellant contends that, having regard to the evidence 
						adduced, the trial Court erred in concluding that the 
						Appellant is liable to the Respondent for the damage to 
						the Respondent's goods. Arguing in Support of this 
						ground of appeal, Counsel for the Appellant contends 
						that the trial Court held the Appellant liable because 
						it failed to adequately consider the evidence before it 
						on the issue of negligence. According to Counsel, the 
						evidence led by the Appellant showed clearly that the 
						Appellant was not negligent hut that the goods skidded 
						off the truck as a result of poor packing, which was a 
						specialised function undertaken by Safebond, and was not 
						the responsibility of the Appellant. Counsel argues that 
						while the Respondent failed to lead any evidence to show 
						that the accident was caused by the Appellant's 
						negligence, there was sufficient evidence from the 
						Appellant to show that the Appellant was not negligent. 
						In support of his contention that the Appellant led 
						sufficient evidence to show that it was not negligent, 
						Counsel refers to the testimonies of the Appellant's 
						representative and the driver of the vehicle from which 
						the damaged goods fell. Counsel again contends that the 
						evidence of the Respondent's witness confirms that the 
						Appellant's driver drove the vehicle with due care and 
						attention, and that the accident was not caused by the 
						negligence of the driver. Counsel says further that the 
						evidence of the Respondent's witnesses confirms the 
						position that Safebond was exclusively responsible for 
						loading goods at the Port of Tema, and that the loading 
						in the present case was done exclusively by Safebond. 
						According to Counsel for the Appellant, the evidence is 
						overwhelming that the Appellant's driver drove the 
						vehicle with due care and attention and had taken due 
						care to secure the Respondent's goods and that the 
						conclusion by the trial Court that the Appellant was 
						negligent was misplaced and not supported by the 
						evidence on record. From my reading of the judgment of 
						the trial Court I discern the following as the reasoning 
						behind the trial Court's conclusion that the Appellant 
						was liable for the damage to the Respondent's goods: i) 
						that there was a contract of carriage of goods between 
						the Appellant and the Respondent in which the Appellant 
						was the carrier; ii) that upon acceptance of the goods 
						for carriage, the Appellant became a bailee of the 
						goods; iii) that as bailee, the Appellant was liable to 
						account for the goods entrusted to it; iv) that while 
						the goods were in the possession of the Appellant and 
						were being transported, they skidded off the Appellant's 
						truck and some of them got damaged; v) that in the 
						absence of a special term in the carriage agreement 
						exempting the Appellant from liability, the Appellant 
						must he held liable for the damage; vi) that there was 
						no evidence of any term exempting the Appellant from 
						liability; and, therefore; vii) that the Appellant was 
						liable for the damage. There is no dispute in this case 
						that there was a contract for the carriage of goods 
						between the Appellant and the Respondent in which the 
						Appellant was the carrier, and that in pursuance of the 
						contract, the goods were entrusted to the Appellant. It 
						is also not in dispute that in the course of carriage, 
						the goods skidded off the Appellant's truck, with some 
						of them getting damaged. The Appellant insists that it 
						carried the goods as a private carrier and not as a 
						common carrier. And yet its representative at the trial 
						conceded that in the transaction in issue in this Suit, 
						it assumed an obligation to transport the goods safely 
						and securely, which is normally an obligation of a 
						common carrier. But even if we grant that the Appellant 
						was a private carrier, it is trite learning that a 
						private carrier is a bailee of the goods entrusted to 
						him and he owes a duty to take reasonable care of the 
						goods. Further, the fact of damage or non-delivery is 
						prima facie evidence of negligence on the part of the 
						private carrier. The Appellant contends that it was not 
						negligent and that the goods got damaged because they 
						skidded off the truck and further, that they skidded off 
						the truck because they were not properly loaded onto the 
						truck by the Respondent's agent. Yet, contrary to this 
						contention, it is on record that the Appellant's driver 
						confirmed during cross-examination that before taking 
						off with the goods, he found them to be properly loaded. 
						Now, with the Appellant's position regarding the loading 
						of the goods contradicted by its own driver and the 
						Appellant's representative stating that in the 
						transaction in issue the Appellant assumed an obligation 
						to transport the goods safely and securely, what 
						evidence is there that rebuts the prima facie evidence 
						of negligence on the part of the Appellant? The 
						Appellant's representative testified that there were 
						bumps in that area of the road where the goods skidded 
						off the truck and that the skidding occurred while the 
						driver was negotiating a curve. The representative says 
						that so long as the road was straight, there was not 
						much of a problem manoeuvering the vehicle. It seems, 
						from the representative's evidence, that as far as the 
						Appellant is concerned, what made the difference and 
						caused problems were the curve that the driver was 
						negotiating, the bumps in the particular section of the 
						road where the accident occurred, and the alleged 
						improper loading of the goods onto the truck. But with 
						the contention that the goods were not properly loaded 
						contradicted by the Appellant's driver, who was present 
						during the loading, what else could explain the skidding 
						off of the goods? Could it be that the driver, who had 
						an obligation to transport the goods safely and 
						securely, did not exercise the care and attention that 
						the conditions at that particular section of the road 
						demanded? in the course of negotiating the curve and in 
						the face of the humps in the road, was the driver 
						overwhelmed? To my mind, the driver's testimony that the 
						goods were properly loaded seriously weakened the 
						Appellant's explanation as to why the goods got damaged. 
						It seems to me that there is sufficient evidence on 
						record to justify the finding by the trial Court that 
						the Appellant was liable for the damage. The principle 
						is established that the findings of fact made by a trial 
						Court are presumed to be right. An appellant who 
						contends that the judgment is against the weight of 
						evidence therefore carries the burden of displacing this 
						presumption and he does so by showing from the record 
						that, indeed, the judgment is not supported by the 
						evidence. I have considered the arguments advanced by 
						Counsel for the Appellant under ground (a) in the light 
						of the evidence on record and I am not satisfied that 
						Counsel has been able to displace the presumption that 
						the trial Court was right in its finding. In my view, 
						this appeal cannot succeed under ground (a) and 1 reject 
						the same. Under ground (b), the Appellant says that the 
						trial Court failed to take account of the fact that the 
						Appellant was a private carrier. The Appellant says the 
						issue whether or not it was a private carrier was a 
						fundamental issue in the case and that the trial Court, 
						therefore, committed an error in failing to consider 
						that issue. In arguing this ground, Counsel for the 
						Appellant laments the failure of the trial Court to show 
						appreciation of the liabilities associated with private 
						carriers, as opposed to common carriers. Counsel says 
						this failure led to the trial Court arriving at the 
						wrong conclusion iii the case and occasioned a 
						substantial miscarriage of justice to the Appellant. 
						According to Counsel, the authorities show that the 
						liability of a private carrier extends only to loss or 
						damage caused by his own negligence or the negligence of 
						his servants. He however acknowledges that the burden of 
						disproving that he or his servants were not negligent is 
						on the private carrier. Turning attention to the 
						evidence, Counsel for the Appellant contends that there 
						was unchallenged evidence that the Appellant was a 
						private carrier and, therefore, that it was only for 
						damage caused by the negligence of the Appellant or its 
						servants that the Appellant could be held liable. 
						Counsel contends that, from the evidence on record, the 
						accident was not caused by the negligence of the 
						Appellant. Counsel says while the Appellant had led 
						evidence to show that it was not negligent, the 
						Respondent was unable to demonstrate by evidence that 
						the accident was caused by the Appellant or that the 
						Appellant was a common carrier and was therefore 
						strictly liable for all loss or damage that occurs in 
						the course of transporting goods. Counsel contends that 
						in the present case, neither the Appellant nor any of 
						its servants was negligent and that if the goods had not 
						skidded off the container, the damage complained about 
						in this case would not have occurred. Counsel submits 
						that no negligence on the part of the Appellant was 
						established and therefore that the trial Court erred in 
						holding that the Appellant was liable for the damage to 
						the goods From his submissions in response, Counsel for 
						the Respondent seems to consider that having regard to 
						the facts of the present case, whether the Appellant is 
						considered a private carrier or a common carrier is not 
						relevant. In the view of Counsel for the Respondent, 
						unless there is an express agreement exempting it from 
						liability, the carrier, whether private or common, is 
						liable for damage resulting from its negligence and that 
						the burdern of proving that it was not negligent is on 
						the carrier. Counsel for the Respondent considers that 
						the trial Court's finding that the Appellant is liable 
						is supported by the evidence and that this Court should 
						not interfere with the same. Carriers are persons who 
						transport other persons or goods, either for reward or 
						gratuitously, from one place to another. In accordance 
						with the nature of their trade or business and the 
						circumstances under which they operate, carriers are 
						classified, mainly, as common carriers and private 
						carriers. The rights and liabilities of common carriers 
						are determined by the common law, subject to statutory 
						qualification, or by special contract. In the absence of 
						statutory qualification or special contract, the common 
						carrier is considered willing to carry any goods or 
						persons for payment on the route he covers. The common 
						law imposes on him the duty to accept any goods of the 
						type he carries or any persons so long as he has space, 
						and he also has a duty at common law to charge by a 
						reasonable rate. Again, at common law, the common 
						carrier is strictly liable for all loss or damage to 
						goods in the course of transportation. The private 
						carrier, on the other hand, is not available to the 
						public for employment in the same manner as the common 
						carrier is. Though he may invite the public to employ 
						him, he reserves to himself the right to reject or 
						accept the offers of goods for carriage, and in deciding 
						whether or not to accept offers of goods, the private 
						carrier in not influenced by availability of space. 
						Largely, in any particular case, he is influenced by the 
						attractiveness or otherwise of the offer made to him. 
						Unlike the common carrier, the private carrier is not 
						strictly liable for loss or damage to the goods he 
						carries. The private carrier is a bailee of the goods 
						and his obligation at common law is to take reasonable 
						care and refrain from dealing with the goods in a manner 
						inconsistent with the bailor's rights in the same. The 
						obligations of the private carrier of goods are set out 
						in Haisbury's Laws of England, Fourth Edition, 2004 
						Reissue, Vol 5(1), par. 507 at page 435 in the following 
						words: &quot;In the absence of any stricter contractual 
						undertaking, a private carrier is liable only where 
						damage, loss or delay results either from negligence or 
						from intentional acts inconsistent with the rights of 
						the consignor or other bailor in the goods, on the part 
						of the carrier or those for whom he is responsible. 
						However, the fact of loss, damage or non-delivery is 
						prima facie evidence of negligence on the part of the 
						carrier or his employees or delegates, and the onus of 
						proving that the misadventure occurred without 
						negligence on his part is on the private carrier as 
						bailee.&quot; According to Halsbury (supra) in agreeing to 
						carry goods, many private carriers inisist on conditions 
						that limit their liability for loss, damage or delay, 
						and it depends on the facts of each particular case 
						whether such conditions have been incorporated as terms 
						of a particular contract of carriage. As has been noted 
						above in respect of the common carrier of goods, his 
						rights and liabilities at common law may be subject to 
						special contract, and it does appear that the tendency 
						in these modern times is for carriage of goods to be 
						regulated by contract. Haisbury observes, therefore, 
						that it is rare these days to have carriers of goods who 
						operate purely as common carriers but fail to limit 
						their common law liabilities by special contract. 
						Indeed, Haisbury (supra, para. 502 at page 431) 
						considers that &quot;the status of a common carrier, who is 
						under an obligation to carry unless he can show 
						reasonable excuse, and (if a carrier of goods) is an 
						insurer of the safety of the goods carried, has become 
						something of an anachronism&quot;.if' this is considered in 
						relation to the tendency of the private carrier to 
						insist on conditions that limit his liability for loss, 
						damage or delay, then it becomes clear that in 
						determining the rights and obligations of the carrier of 
						goods in these modern times, it is more helpful to look 
						at the terms actually agreed between the parties or the 
						responsibilities actually assumed by them than to 
						compartmentalise carriers as common or private and infer 
						their rights or obligations from the tags given them. 
						Now, under ground (b) of this appeal. the Appellant is 
						complaining that the trial Court failed to consider that 
						it is a private carrier and it is also contending that 
						the issue whether or not it is a private carrier was 
						fundamental in the case. It seems to me, from what has 
						been observed in the immediately preceding paragraph, 
						however, that the fundamental issue in the case is not 
						so much the class into which the Appellant generally 
						places itself as a carrier; the fundamental issue, 
						rather, is the obligations the parties agreed to assume 
						in the particular carriage transaction which is the 
						subject matter of this case. In paragraph 3 of its 
						Statement of Defence, the Appellant contended that it is 
						a private carrier and averred that in the transaction in 
						issue, it agreed with the Respondent on specific terms 
						for the carriage of the goods. The Appellant proceeded 
						in paragraph 4 of the Statement of Defence to give as 
						one of the key terms agreed the assumption by the 
						Respondent of responsibility for the loading of the 
						goods on the flat rack container. Then at the trial, 
						during the cross-examination of its representative, the 
						Appellant also acknowledged its responsibility for the 
						safety and security of the goods during transportation. 
						The question was put to the representative, &quot;so what it 
						means is that during the transportation you were solely 
						responsible for the safety and security of the goods&quot;, 
						and his response was, &quot;Yes my lord we were.&quot; In my view, 
						in the face of acknowledgement that it was responsible 
						for the safety and security of the goods during 
						transportation, the Appellant cannot hide behind the tag 
						of a private carrier and insist that, in the transaction 
						in issue, its responsibility was limited to taking 
						reasonable care of the goods. If in this transaction, 
						the Appellant undertook to ensure the safety and 
						security of the goods during transportation, then in my 
						view, it is bound to meet that responsibility and if the 
						goods get damaged during transportation, it is obliged 
						to satisfactorily explain the damage. Counsel for the 
						Appellant has contended in his Written Submission that 
						the trial Court failed to show appreciation of the 
						liabilities associated with private carriers. But even 
						if we grant that the Appellant is a private carrier who 
						is liable only where damage, loss or delay results from 
						its negligence, as stated in Halsburp, that liability 
						prevails only in the absence of &quot;any stricter 
						contractual undertaking&quot;. In the present case, the 
						Appellant, on its own admission, undertook the stricter 
						obligation of ensuring the safety and security of the 
						goods during transportation. Further, where goods in the 
						hands of the private carrier are damaged, the damage is 
						considered as prima facie evidence of negligence on the 
						part of the carrier or its employee or delegate, and the 
						carrier bears the burden of proving that the damage 
						occurred without its negligence or the negligence of its 
						employees or delegates. And in the present case, how has 
						the Appellant demonstrated that neither itself nor any 
						of its employees was negligent? The explanation given by 
						the Appellant regarding the damage was that it occurred 
						because the goods skidded off the flat rack container; 
						that the goods skidded off the flat rack container 
						because they were not properly loaded; that the loading 
						was a specialised function of an agent of the Respondent 
						with whom it had no contractual relationship; and, there 
						fore that it was not liable for the damage caused to the 
						goods. As noted above, however, the driver of the 
						Appellant, who was present during the loading and who 
						claims to have inspected the goods after loading, 
						confirmed that he found the goods to be properly loaded, 
						if the case of the Appellant is that the goods skidded 
						off because they were not properly loaded and it turns 
						out in the evidence that, after all, the goods were 
						properly loaded, then to what else does the Appellant 
						attribute the damage to the goods? in my view, the 
						testimony of the driver seriously undermined the 
						explanation which the Appellant sought to offer and 
						rendered the explanation unacceptable. I agree with 
						Counsel for the Respondent that the trial Court's 
						finding that the Appellant was liable for the damage is 
						supported by the evidence on record. This Court v ill 
						therefore not disturb the finding of the trial Court and 
						this ground of appeal is also rejected. The rejection of 
						this ground means that this appeal has failed. The 
						outstanding matter for consideration now is the 
						Respondent's cross- appeal, which contends that since 
						the Respondent incurred financial loss as a result of 
						the Appellant's negligence, the trial Court ought not 
						have refused the Respondent's claim for interest on the 
						sum of $24,937.75, which was the cost at which the 
						Respondent repaired the damaged goods. In the view of 
						Counsel for the Respondent, the rationale for awarding 
						interest is to compensate the claimant for interest for 
						the commercial loss of his money. He contends that 
						having found in the present case that the Respondent 
						paid the sum of $24,937.75 on 22nd November, 2005 in 
						respect of the repair of the damaged goods, the trial 
						Court ought to have awarded interest to the Respondent 
						on the said sum from that date to compensate the 
						Respondent for the commercial loss of the use of its 
						money. Counsel notes that the award of interest by the 
						Courts may be discretionary. He contends, however, that 
						a discretion must be exercised fairly and reasonably; In 
						his view, the trial Court did not deal fairly with M. e 
						Respondent in the present case in refusing to award it 
						interest. Counsel for the Appellant does not however 
						consider that the Respondent is entitled to interest 
						Counsel for the Appellant contends that interest can be 
						awarded only on the basis of agreement between the 
						parties or under a statutory provision He says that in 
						the present case there is no agreement between the 
						parties for the award of interest, and neither is there 
						any statutory provision under which, in the present 
						circumstance, the Respondent could claim interest. He 
						therefore urges this Court to dismiss the cross-appeal. 
						Interest may be awarded at common law on the basis of an 
						express agreement for payment of interest, or in 
						circumstances where an agreement to pay interest can be 
						inferred from the course of dealing between the parties 
						or from the nature of the trade or a custom or other 
						relationship existing between the parties. Further, 
						interest may be awarded at common law by way of damages 
						for breach of contract, other than a contract merely to 
						pay money, where the contract, if performed, would, to 
						the knowledge of the parties, have entitled the claimant 
						to receive interest. Interest may also be awarded 
						against a defendant in equity where the defendant ought 
						to have done something which would have entitled the 
						plaintiff to interest at common law, or where by the 
						wrongful conduct of the defendant, the plaintiff has 
						been prevented from doing something that would have 
						entitled him to interest, or where, as underscored by 
						the Supreme Court in the case of Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM) 
						&amp; Another Vs. Farmex Limited [1989-1990] 2 GLR 623, the 
						plaintiff has been deprived of the prospect of making 
						more money from money due him from the defendant. In the 
						Farmex case (supra), the High Court awarded in favour of 
						the Plaintiff the sum of £23,800.00 as special damages 
						for the loss of mangoes which were to be carried, 
						between the defendant airlines, from Accra to London. 
						The High Court also awarded interest on the said sum in 
						favour of the Plaintiff, but on appeal to this Court, 
						this Court by a majority of two to one set aside the 
						order awarding interest on the ground that the Plaintiff 
						had been indemnified in full and that there was no 
						justification for awarding interest on the sum awarded 
						as damages. On further appeal to the Supreme Court. 
						however, the Supreme Court considered that this Court 
						was wrong in setting aside the award of interest. In 
						apparent response to this Court's statement that there 
						was no justification for awarding interest, the Supreme 
						Court affirmed per A dude JSC at page 635 of the Report 
						that &quot;(t)he prospect of making more money with the 
						£23,800 or otherwise benefitting from it, is the 
						justification for the award of interest&quot;. Where, 
						therefore, a party has suffered commercial loss of the 
						use of his money as a result of the wrongful conduct of 
						the other party, there may be ground for the award of 
						interest. For the purposes of this cross-appeal, 
						however. I consider it necessary that we note three 
						things about the award of interest. These are that, as 
						conceded by Counsel for the Respondent, the award of 
						interest may lie in the discretion of the Court, that 
						generally, for interest to be awarded, it ought to he 
						claimed, and that the award of interest may, in 
						appropriate cases, be by way of damages. In the present 
						case, the Respondent claimed interest but did not claim 
						general damages. The trial Court however refused to 
						award interest to the Respondent but rather awarded it 
						general damages in the sum of ¢10,000,000.00. Was the 
						award of ¢10,000,000.00 as general damages a 
						discretionary award intended to compensate the 
						Respondent for the Appellant's delay in settling the 
						cost of repairing the damaged goods? In other words, was 
						the trial Court awarding interest to the Respondent by 
						way of general damages? And if it was, could such an 
						award be properly made? I was looking for answers to 
						these questions in the Written Submissions of Counsel, 
						particularly, Counsel for the Respondent. Counsel for 
						the Respondent however proceeded with the cross-appeal 
						as if the general damages awarded bore no relationship 
						whatever to the interest claimed. As has been noted 
						above, the authorities suggest that in appropriate 
						cases, interest may be awarded by way of damages. But 
						will an award by way of general damages be appropriate? 
						In the English case of Wadsworth Vs. Lydall [1981]2 All 
						E.R 401, among the claims made by the Plaintiff was one 
						for special damages in respect of interest which he had 
						to pay as a result of the delay in the payment of a debt 
						owed him by the Defendant. The Queen's Bench Division 
						disallowed the claim for special damages in respect of 
						interest and on appeal by the Plaintiff to the Court of 
						Appeal. the Defendant contended that the Plaintiff was 
						precluded from pursuing the claim for special damages by 
						the decision of the House of Lords in the case of 
						London, chatham and Dover Railway Company Vs. South 
						Easter,, Railway Company [1893] AC 429 that, at common 
						law, in the absence of any agreement or statutory 
						provisions for the payment of interest, a court had no 
						power to award interest by way of damages. The English 
						Court of Appeal however distinguished the case from the 
						London, Chatham case, and held that the London, chatham 
						case was concerned only with a claim for interest by way 
						of general damages. The Court of Appeal proceeded 
						further in the following words: &quot;If a plaintiff pleads 
						and can prove that he has suffered special damage as a 
						result of the defendant's failure to perform his 
						obligation under a contract, and such damage is not too 
						remote on the principle of Hadley Vs. Baxendale 
						..........., I can see no logical reason why such 
						special damages should be irrecoverable merely because 
						the obligation on which the defendant defaulted was an 
						obligation to pay money and not some other type of 
						obligation&quot;. The Wadsworth case seems to me to have 
						established in England that while in an appropriate case 
						interest may be awarded by way of special damages, 
						general damages will not normally be awarded as 
						compensation for commercial loss of the use of money. 
						Now, in the present case, if the general damages of 
						¢10,000,000.00 was intended to be a substitute for the 
						interest claimed by the Respondent, then it would 
						suggest that the trial Court considered that the 
						Respondent was entitled to be compensated for being 
						deprived of the opportunity of making more money from 
						money due him from the Appellant. And if the Respondent 
						was entitled to be SO compensated, was it a fair 
						exercise of discretion to impose ¢10,000,000.00 on the 
						Respondent without any explanation? I do not find from 
						the record any facts or circumstances that justify the 
						award of ¢10,000,000.00 in place of the claim for 
						interest indorsed on the Respondent's Writ of Summons, 
						and drawing on the situation in England, I consider the 
						award of general damages in the circumstances of the 
						present case as inappropriate. In my view, therefore, 
						the award of general damages made by the trial Court 
						ought to be set aside. Further, guided by the principle 
						in the Farmex case, I form the view that the Respondent 
						is entitled to interest on the sum of $24,937.75 paid by 
						it in respect of the repair of the damaged goods. In 
						conclusion, the appeal fails while the cross-appeal 
						succeeds. The general damages in the sum of 
						¢10,000,000.00 awarded by the trial Court to the 
						Respondent is hereby set aside and judgment is hereby 
						entered in favour of the Respondent for relief (iv) 
						indorsed on its Writ of Summons. The interest shall be 
						calculated at the commercial dollar rate from 22nd 
						November, 2005 to date of judgment. COUNSEL: MR.
