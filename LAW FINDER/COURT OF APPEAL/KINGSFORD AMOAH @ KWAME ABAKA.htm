						<font face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US">The appellant, 
						Kingsford Amoah alias Kwame Abaka was jointly tried with 
						one Yaw Duodu in the High Court, Cape Coast. Both 
						accused persons faced a common count of conspiracy to 
						commit robbery contrary to section 23(1) and section 149 
						of the Criminal Act, Act 29 as amended by Act 646 of 
						2003 and the substantive offence of robbery contrary to 
						section 149 of Act 29 the Criminal Act, 1960, Act 29. 
						Both accused persons were convicted and sentenced to 
						forty years on each count to run ;. concurrently. The 
						second accused, Kingsford Amoah alias Kwame Abaka has 
						appealed against his conviction and sentence. The facts 
						were that the accused persons who are farmers hatched a 
						plan to snatch a taxi cab and so on the 29th June 2007, 
						the two, armed with two knives contacted one Kwame Takyi, 
						a driver of a Tico taxi cab and hired his services. They 
						directed the driver, now deceased, to convey them from 
						Mankessim to Kromanmu to purchase Akpeteshie. On 
						reaching Kromanmu and after stopping for a while to 
						conduct other businesses including making calls from a 
						space-to-space operator, they further directed the 
						driver to drive towards Mando. Just about a kilometer 
						from Kromanmu and towards Mando, they stopped the driver 
						and lured him into the bush ostensibly to fetch the 
						Akpeteshie from a cottage. On reaching a spot, they 
						inflicted fatal knife wounds on the driver and dragged 
						him into the bush. They then took the keys of the taxi 
						cab and the sum of ¢120,000.00 (GH¢12,00) from him and 
						sped off with the vehicle to Accra leaving the driver in 
						the bush. It was in the course of the transaction for 
						the sale of the taxi that the two accused persons were 
						arrested after notice of the missing taxi and the driver 
						was relayed around The accused persons could not give 
						any tangible reason for possessing the taxi cab which 
						was reported missing and so they were arrested. At the 
						Police Station, the accused allegedly admitted the 
						offence. In the meantime, the driver of the taxi cab was 
						found in the bush the next day dead with stabbed wounds. 
						The accused persons were accordingly charged with the 
						offences of conspiracy and robbery before the High 
						Court. The appellant being aggrieved appealed against 
						his conviction and sentence. The grounds of appeal are:- 
						(I)That the judgment is against the weight of evidence. 
						(ii)Other grounds will be filed on the receipt of the 
						record of proceedings. No further grounds of appeal were 
						filed. Counsel for the accused relied on the sole ground 
						that the judgment is against the weight of evidence. 
						Before I consider this ground, I must state that Counsel 
						for the appellant was most unhelpful in what he called a 
						statement of case. Counsel only repeated the charges and 
						the facts and stated that the plea of Alibi by the 
						accused was ignored by the trial court. It is most 
						disappointing.Lawyers must perform their professional 
						duties more seriously Their clients. Since an appeal is 
						a re-hearing, an appellate court is obliged to review 
						the evidence as a whole and make its own findings of 
						fact, if so justified. See Republic vs Nana Osei Kwadjo 
						II [2008] 1GMJ 42 SC Holding 5. I would review the 
						evidence as a whole and make my own findings of fact to 
						enable me come to a conclusion whether the conviction 
						and sentence was right. I would therefore consider the 
						law on the offence of conspiracy in relation to the 
						evidence on record and later turn my attention to the 
						substantive charge of robbery. Section 23(1) of the 
						Criminal Offences Act, 1960, (Act 29) provides:- &quot;23(1) 
						where two or more persons agree to act together with a 
						common purpose for or in committing or abetting a 
						criminal offence, whether with or without a previous 
						concert or deliberation, each of them commits a 
						conspiracy to commit or abet the criminal offence&quot;. For 
						the prosecution to succeed in a conspiracy charge, they 
						must prove:- That the accused persons agreed to act 
						together with a common purpose for or in committing or 
						abetting a crime.The prosecution would need to prove one 
						ingredient or another depending on the charge laid. 
						Before I consider the evidence adduced at the trial, I 
						must state that as in all cases the prosecution ought to 
						prove its case beyond all reasonable doubts as required 
						by sections 11(2) and 13(1) of the Evidence Act, NRCD 
						323. Section 13(2) of NRCD 323 only required the accused 
						to raise reasonable doubts as to his guilt. In proof of 
						its case, the prosecution called six witnesses. The 
						accused persons also testified and called one witness. 
						Counsel for the appellant did not make any submission 
						with regard to the charge of conspiracy. It is only the 
						learned Principal State Attorney who submitted that the 
						accused persons acted together and that constituted the 
						conspiracy to commit the robbery. In this appeal, it is 
						incumbent upon us to determine by the evidence on record 
						whether the evidence established conspiracy between the 
						appellant and the first convict and whether the 
						appellant's conviction was right and therefore should 
						not be disturbed. PW2 Vida Essuman testified that on the 
						29th day of June 2007 at about 5pm, she saw the 2 
						accused persons and the deceased driver of the Tico taxi 
						got down from the car. She also saw the two accused 
						standing by the taxi with the deceased after they got 
						down at Mando Junction. At that juncture, she called the 
						first convict but he told her he was doing some rounds 
						but he refused to come. PW2 saw the deceased driver who 
						made a call at her end and after the call, the deceased 
						asked PW2 the distance to Mando. She asked him why he 
						asked that question, the victim replied that the two 
						accused persons hired his taxi to pick alcohol from the 
						place. PW2 told the victim that the distance to Mando 
						was not far. PW2 testified further that the victim went 
						back to the car and then the appellant came to sit at a 
						beer bar near her and smoked something which looked like 
						cigarette. When the appellant finished drinking, he 
						bought pure water from PW2 and thereafter the three 
						persons drove off. PW2 testified that the next day, she 
						heard that somebody had been killed in the bush and when 
						she went to the scene she identified the victim as the 
						driver who made a call at her place the previous day. 
						She also identified the picture of the victim. PW3 
						corroborated the evidence of PW2 to the effect that on 
						the day of the incident, she stopped the said taxi but 
						the first convict told her they were going to pick some 
						alcoholic drinks and so she could not be picked. PW3 
						also saw the 1st convict and the appellant together with 
						the deceased driver in the car and she identified the 
						picture of the victim. In the same vein PW4 a student 
						also saw and joined the taxi in which the appellant was 
						and he alighted at Kromanmu. PW5, a Police Inspector 
						also further corroborated the evidence of PW2, PW3 and 
						PW4 to the effect that upon investigations he found the 
						body of the victim, took photographs of it and sent it 
						to the Central Hospital, Cape Coast. PW5 later arrested 
						the appellants upon information when they sought to sell 
						the taxi in Accra. PW7 the Police. investigator also 
						further corroborated the evidence of the prosecution on 
						the conspiracy charge. The appellants sought to rely on 
						the defence of alibi and called DW1 who rather confirmed 
						the case of the prosecution. DW1 said second appellant 
						stayed with her until 5pm when the first convict came 
						and they left in a taxi to Accra to bring down a truck. 
						I would consider the defence of alibi put up by the 
						appellants in detail when considering the substantive 
						charge of robbery. The alibi could only be described as 
						an afterthought and not reasonably probable. I therefore 
						find that appellant and the convict acted together to 
						commit the robbery. I therefore agree with the learned 
						trial judge that the prosecution had been able to prove 
						the conspiracy charge against the appellants. Now to the 
						substantive charge of robbery, Section 149 of the 
						Criminal Act, 1960, Act 29 as amended by the Criminal 
						Code (Amendment) Act, 2003 (Act 646) provides:- &quot;(1) 
						Whoever commits robbery is guilty of an offence and 
						shall be liable, upon conviction on trial summarily or 
						on indictment, to imprisonment for a term of not less 
						than ten years, and where the offence is committed by 
						the use of an offensive weapon or offensive missile, the 
						offender shall upon conviction be liable to imprisonment 
						for a term of not less than fifteen years. (2) For the 
						purpose of subsection (1), the Attorney-General shall in 
						all cases determine whether the offence shall be tried 
						summarily or on indictment. (3) In this section 
						&quot;offensive weapon&quot; means any article made or adapted for 
						use to cause injury to the person or damage to property 
						or intended by the person who has the weapon to use it 
						to cause injury or damage, and &quot;offensive missile&quot; 
						includes a stone, brick or any article or thing likely 
						to cause harm, damage or injury if thrown&quot;. The 
						definition of robbery is provided in section 150 of the 
						of the Criminal Offences Act, 1960, (Act 29) &quot;150. A 
						person who steals a thing is guilty of robbery if, in 
						and for the purpose of stealing the thing, uses any 
						force or causes any harm to any person, or he uses any 
						threat of criminal assault or harm to any person, with 
						intent thereby to prevent or overcome the resistance of 
						that or of any person to the stealing of the thing&quot;. 
						This definition of robbery in section 150 of Act 29 was 
						considered in Behome v The Republic [1979] GLR 112 where 
						the court held that: 'Under section 150 of Act 29, A 
						would only be guilty of robbery if in stealing a thing 
						he used any force or- caused any harm or used any threat 
						of criminal assault to B, to prevent or overcome the 
						resistance of B or C to the stealing of the thing. The 
						fear might be either of personal violence to the person 
						robbed or to a member of his family in the restrictive 
						sense of a man, his wife and children. And the thing 
						stolen must be from the person or the one threatened in 
						his presence, if the property was under his immediate 
						and personal care and protection&quot;. In sum, the court 
						held that one is guilty of robbery if in stealing a 
						thing he used any force or cause any harm or used any 
						threat of criminal assault with intent thereby to 
						prevent or overcome the resistance of his victims, to 
						the stealing of the thing. In R v Dawson [1977] 64 CAR 
						170, the court held that when a person is charged with 
						robbery, the sole question is whether he used force on 
						any person in order to steal. To secure a conviction of 
						a person charged with robbery, the prosecution must 
						prove beyond reasonable doubts that:- 1. The accused has 
						stolen a thing. 2. For the purpose of stealing, the 
						accused person used force or caused harm to any person. 
						3. The force or the threat of criminal assault or harm 
						used must be with the intent to prevent or overcome the 
						resistance of any person to the stealing of the thing. 
						4. The identity of the accused with regard to the 
						commission of the robbery. What were the facts upon 
						which the trial judge found as established by the 
						evidence from which the appellants were said to have 
						committed the offence of robbery? Robbery is basically 
						stealing and the intention of the accused is primarily 
						to dishonestly appropriate as under section 120(1) of 
						Act 29 something from another person. The accused must 
						not be the owner of the thing appropriated as required 
						under section 122(2) OF Act 29. The accused must not 
						have a claim to the property stolen. There must also be 
						absence of consent from the owner as to its 
						appropriation by the accused person. This means that all 
						the elements of stealing must be present. Further, the 
						accused must have used some force or harm or threat of 
						criminal assault with intent to overcome the resistance 
						of that person to the stealing of the thing. PW1 
						established that he is the owner of the Tico taxi cab 
						number GW 7537 X driven by his driver and victim. His 
						driver and the taxi got missing but he had information 
						that the appellants attempted to sell his car in Accra, 
						and they were arrested and he got his car ' back, The 
						appellant did not lay claim to the taxi cab. PW2 
						provided a clue to the stealing which led to the robbery 
						as follows in her evidence in chief as follows: Q. Now 
						what work do you do? A. I operate a space-to-space 
						business. Q. Where do you operate your space-to-space 
						business? A. I operate my business at Ajumako Kromanmu, 
						Q. Now on the 29th June 2007 where were you? A. I was at 
						Kromanmu working. Q. Now whiles at your work place did 
						any thing happen around 5pm going? A. Yes, my Lord. Q. 
						Tell the court what happened. A. My Lord, I was there 
						working around 530pm when I saw Tico taxi from the 
						Denkyira road heading towards Mando. Q. What was the 
						colour of the Tico taxi? A. My Lord, it was white and 
						yellow Q. Do you remember the number? A. Yes, my Lord. 
						Q. Tell the Court. A. GW4537X Q. And when you saw it 
						what happened? A. When I saw the car from the Denkyira 
						road and it went to stop at the Mando Junction and then 
						2 boys and the driver got out of the car. Q. And what 
						happened? A. When I saw the car from Denkyira road and 
						it went to stop at the Mando junction and then 2 boys 
						and the driver got out of the car. Q. Those two boys in 
						the vehicle where are they? A. They are the two accused 
						person standing before the court. Q. You said the two 
						were with the driver. Is it right? A. Yes, my Lord. Q. 
						And what happened? A. When they alighted I called A1 and 
						he said he was making some lines and was coming but he 
						didn't come. It was during that time that the driver 
						came to make a call from my end. After making the call, 
						he asked me whether distance left to Mando was far and I 
						said no but asked why and he replied by saying that the 
						two boys chartered his taxi and he was to go and pick 
						some alcohol but he does not know the place. That is why 
						he was asking that question and I said it wasn't far. 
						They he went back to his car. Then A2 came to sit at a 
						beer bar near me and was smoking something which is like 
						a cigarette but not a cigarette. It was something I 
						don't quite know. When he finished, he came to buy pure 
						water from me at that time it was sold for ¢400.00 and 
						he gave me ¢500.00 so I gave him a change of ¢100.00. 
						After that the three of them went into the car and drove 
						off towards Mando. Q. Now when they left did you hear 
						anything thereafter? A. My Lord, at about 9.0'clock the 
						next day, we heard that somebody had been killed in the 
						bush so we were all running to that direction, when I 
						got there I said &quot;this is the driver that came to make a 
						call at my place yesterday' And then returned back home. 
						BY COURT: Picture of driver identified and marked 
						exhibit ID1&#8217;. In cross-examination, PW2 was portrayed as 
						having contradicted herself for having said in her 
						evidence-in-chief that she saw appellant smoking 
						something like cigarette and in her unsworn statement, 
						Exhibit 1 she stated that he smoked Indian hemp. Further 
						PW2 was said to have denied knowing the appellant's name 
						in her evidence but in Exhibit &quot;I&quot;, she mentioned his 
						name as Kwame Abaka. These two irreconcilable statements 
						of PW2 could be described as confused. Where however in 
						such a circumstance, there is other evidence which 
						overwhelmingly override the uncertain nature of that of 
						PW2, then the overwhelming evidence would reduce the 
						legal effect of the conflicting evidence. In his book 
						Criminal Law in Ghana at page 128 to 129, P. K. Twumasi 
						stated as follows - &quot;It is not unusual for witnesses who 
						were present at the commission of a crime to give 
						evidence which is not free from discrepancies. This is 
						only natural because the ability to observe, describe or 
						to memorize an event may differ from person to person. 
						Where there are discrepancies (or inconsistencies or 
						contradictions in the testimonies of the prosecution 
						witnesses, it is the duty of the judge to direct himself 
						or the jury or assessors to the discrepancies and to 
						tell them that such discrepancies are not fatal to the 
						prosecution's case unless they go to the very root of 
						the matter in issue. A discrepancy in the case of the 
						prosecution is fatal only when it cannot be reconciled 
						with the rest of the evidence or when it is material or 
						goes to the very root of the matter in issue'. See 
						MENSAH VS THE STATE [1963] 1 GLR 26 SC. The learned 
						author however, stated that where however the 
						contradictions are irreconcilable, the prosecution 
						cannot be said to have proved that case beyond 
						reasonable doubt. See Kotey vs The State [1963] GLR 41 
						SC. An examination of the evidence of PW2 in the light 
						of the totality of the evidence adduced by the 
						prosecution witnesses reveals no such irreconcilable 
						contradictions. See Ametewee vs The State [1964] GLR 551 
						where the Supreme Court in Holding (3) held that the 
						conflicts in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses 
						complained of by the appellant's counsel were not 
						germain to the crucial issue which the jury had to 
						determine. PW3 stated that she stopped the car to join 
						in. According to PW3 the car stopped but the first 
						convict came out of the car and said they were not going 
						to her destination but were going to pick some alcoholic 
						drinks. She stated that she saw the two accused in The 
						vehicle. PW3's evidence was not seriously challenged 
						under cross-examination. PW4, a student then also 
						boarded the said Tico taxi on the day of the incident 
						and he also identified the two accused persons as those 
						who were on the vehicle with the driver whom he 
						identified in a picture marked as ID1. He also 
						identified the deceased driver when he went to the 
						scene. His evidence was not punctured at all and it 
						corroborated the evidence of PW3. PW5 Inspector William 
						Yaw Crabbe received a complaint, went to the scene and 
						found the body of the deceased driver tying in a blood 
						of blood. He saw a cut on the eye brow, the arm and big 
						deep cut at the back of the body. He also saw a jack 
						knife near the body and also saw blood stains. PW5 also 
						noticed the sign of struggling and caused a photograph 
						to be taken of the body and which pictures he identified 
						as ID1, lD2 and lD4. He also went to Accra to bring down 
						the accused persons after they were arrested by the 
						Police in Accra to Cape Coast together with the stolen 
						Tico car. He also took the body to the Central Hospital, 
						Cape Coast for autopsy. The evidence of PW5 corroborated 
						that of PW6, Chief Inspector Sackey Odonkor and PW1, PW2 
						and PW3. It is clear that the stealing, the force and 
						harm used, the appellants' identity and harm caused to 
						the deceased together with signs of the weapons used to 
						overcome the deceased to his resistance to the stealing 
						of the car are on record. PW6 testified that the first 
						appellant told him that he and the second appellant 
						hired a taxi from Mankessim to a village called Kromanmu 
						to convey Akpeteshie with the aim of robbing the car. 
						According to PW6, the appellants purchased two knives 
						which they used to kill the victim. They were tendered 
						as Exhibits &quot;A&quot; and &quot;A1&quot; being a kitchen and &quot;okapi&quot; 
						knives respectively, found at the scene. He tendered the 
						cover of a driving license belonging to the deceased as 
						Exhibit C. PW6 further testified that the second 
						appellant insisted that he was involved. He narrated how 
						the first convict described the scene and actually 
						tallied with what he saw at the scene. Palm seedlings 
						uprooted by the appellant at the scene were tendered as 
						Exhibit D. Photographs of the posture of the deceased 
						were tendered as Exhibit E1E1¬E4. The caution statement 
						of the 1St accused which was a confession statement was 
						tendered as Exhibit &quot;F&quot; and the charged statement as 
						Exhibit &quot;G&quot;. The appellant's caution statement was 
						tendered as Exhibit &quot;H&quot; and his charged statement as 
						&quot;J&quot;. Exhibit &quot;K&quot; was tendered as the Post Moterm report. 
						The 1st accused's charged statement sought to establish 
						that he and the appellant were not involved. I believe 
						that this statement was an afterthought since the 1st 
						accuseds caution statement led to the clue of the 
						robbery. I am satisfied that the prosecution adduced 
						prima facie evidence to warrant the appellant to open 
						his defence. The prosecution succeeded in establishing 
						all the ingredients of robbery, that is the stealing, 
						the force and harm used and the force and harm caused to 
						the deceased driver to overcome his resistance to the 
						robbery. Now, I am enjoined to examine the evidence of 
						the appellant as required under section 11(3) of the 
						Evidence Act NRCD 323 which provides:- &quot;(3) In a 
						criminal action, the burden of producing evidence when 
						it is on the accused as to any fact the converse of 
						which is essential to guilt, requires the accused to 
						produce sufficient evidence so that on all the evidence 
						a reasonable mind could have a reasonable doubt as to 
						guilt&quot;. This section 11(3) was for the appellant to lead 
						such evidence to cast doubt or discredit the evidence 
						proffered by the prosecution. Lutterodt vs The Republic 
						[1963] 2 GLR 429 SC laid down the procedure to guide 
						judges where the prosecution had led a prima facie case. 
						The judge is enjoined to examine the case of the defence 
						in three stages:- (a) if the explanation of the defence 
						is acceptable, then the accused must be acquitted; (b) 
						if the explanation of the defence is not acceptable, but 
						is reasonably probable, the accused should be acquitted, 
						(c) if quite apart from the defence's explanation, the 
						court is satisfied on a consideration of the whole 
						evidence, that the accused is guilty, it must convict. 
						What is the defence put up by the appellant. He said he 
						is a driver and knew the 1st convict, He denied having 
						committed robbery with the 1st convict. He also denied 
						the evidence of PW2, PW3 and PW4. He stated that he was 
						helping his sister when the ls convict came with two 
						others and that one of them wanted a driver to go with 
						him to Accra to bring down a big car and wanted him to 
						go for it. He agreed, took his identity card and 
						informed his sister and they all left for Accra. They 
						were moving on with the car which he called the tico 
						taxi cab and it developed a fault. In Accra the car was 
						taken to a workshop and the mechanic took out what was 
						faulty and gave it to the owner to go and purchase a new 
						one. Appellant then told the first convict he was going 
						to look for something to eat and while returning he saw 
						Policemen standing by the first convict. Upon his 
						enquiry, he was told the Police were looking for the 
						owner of the vehicle. At that juncture, the Police took 
						them to the Police Station and expected the owner to 
						follow up. He said the Police detained them and were 
						beaten up. They were later brought to the Cape Coast 
						Police Station and detained. They were taken to the spot 
						of the incident and he denied uprooting palm seedlings. 
						The appellant admitted in his evidence-in-chief that it 
						was the Tico taxi that he and the first convict and 
						another took to Accra. He also admitted in cross- 
						examination that:- Q.The Tico taxi you took to Accra, is 
						that the taxi by which you were standing with A1 for 
						which your picture was taken? A. Yes, my Lord&quot;. The 
						appellant midway filed a Notice of alibi which 
						particulars stated that on the day of the incident he 
						was at home; the whole day with Abena Kwakyewa of House 
						No. 13, Ekrornase. The trial judge ruled that he should 
						call the witness to establish the alibi DW1 Abena 
						Kwakyewa who both the first convict and the appellant 
						relied on. DW1 testified that the appellant is her 
						brother and they stayed together at Ekromase the whole 
						day until 5pm. At about a little after 5pm, the first 
						convict came with two others in a taxi cab and after 
						consultations with them, the appellant informed her he 
						was going to Accra to pick a car for commercial 
						activities. They left and she did not hear from them 
						until she heard that they were arrested.It is clear that 
						the appellants defence hinged on Alibi. Section 131 of 
						Act 30 dealt with Alibi. The trial judge was right when 
						he allowed the appellant to file his notice of alibi 
						with particulars and called a witness to that effect at 
						a time the prosecution had called two witnesses. See R v 
						Val-Vannis (1957) 2 W.A.L.R. 199. The defence of alibi 
						does not rule out the possibility of the trial Court 
						rejecting alibi and accepting the evidence of the 
						prosecution witnesses implicating the appellant. See 
						Forkuo vs The Republic [1997-98] 1 GLR 1 CA. In the 
						alibi filed it was stated that the appellant was with 
						DW1 for the whole day. However, in DW1's evidence, she 
						stated that he was with her until 5pm when he left. 
						Incidentally, it was the same time that PW2, PW3 and PW4 
						identified the appellant as the very person who was with 
						the first convict at the time they were at Krornanmu. I 
						agree with the learned trial judge that the alibi was 
						not proved and that DW1 was only belatedly brought into 
						the picture as damage repair. The alibi is therefore an 
						afterthought and I reject it.Moreover, the accused was 
						only required to only raise a reasonable doubt as to his 
						guilt See section 11(3) of NRCD 323 (Supra). The 
						appellant was therefore required to have explained the 
						inconsistencies in his previous statement with regard to 
						his testimony in court if he was to be believed. In Yaro 
						v The Republic [1979] GLR 10 the court held that a 
						previous statement made by a witness to the Police which 
						was in distinct conflict in his evidence on oath was 
						always admissible to discredit or contradict him and it 
						should be presumed that the evidence on oath was false 
						unless he gives a satisfactory explanation of the prior 
						inconsistent statement. in the instant appeal, the 
						appellant in Exhibit 'H' his caution statement stated 
						that the first convict passed by his house when going to 
						farm around 7am on the day of the incident and told him 
						that his brother had come from Accra to Komanmu and that 
						he would go to Mankessim before visiting his brother. He 
						again stated in his unsworn statement that at about 
						10am, the first convict came to him to borrow ¢10,000.00 
						(GH¢1.00) to travel with but he told him that he was 
						going to travel to Mankessim to buy some materials for 
						selling. Both of them joined the same vehicle but he 
						told the driver he would go to his sister before paying 
						him. They got to Mankessim at 11 am and the first 
						convict left for Kromanmu and returned at 3.30pm and at 
						4.20pm, they left together with a brother of the first 
						convict to Accra. His evidence in court is completely at 
						variance. The appellant testified that he was helping 
						his sister when the first convict came and told him that 
						one of those he came with has a brother in Accra and was 
						looking for a driver so he took his identity card, 
						informed his sister and left in a Tico taxi cab. 
						Furthermore, DW1 told the court that the appellant was 
						with her the whole day until 5pm before they left for 
						Accra. The appellant's evidence is thus discredited and 
						could not be believed.I agree with the learned trial 
						judge that the appellant's presence at the place of 
						arrest in Accra, while attempting to sell the taxi cab 
						with the first convict was not explained enough. The 
						defence put up by the appellant cannot be acceptable and 
						therefore not reasonably probable. I therefore find that 
						the appellant and the convict committed the robbery as 
						charged. I hold that the prosecution proved their case 
						beyond reasonable doubt and therefore the conviction and 
						sentence should not be disturbed. The appeal is hereby 
						refused and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.
