						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the 24th of October 
						2002, Woanyah, J. sitting at the High Court, Agona 
						Swedru entered Judgment in favour of the defendant 
						respondent hereafter referred to as the defendant 
						against the plaintiffs appellants now simply referred to 
						as the plaintiffs in an action commenced by them for 
						these reliefs:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) A declaration of 
						title to all that piece or parcel of land situate, lying 
						and being at Agona Swedru in the Central Region of the 
						Republic of Ghana.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) An order of 
						accounts of all the rents received by the defendant in 
						respect of the said property since March, 1999.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) An order of 
						perpetual injunction restraining the defendant, his 
						agents and assigns from interfering with the plaintiffs' 
						peaceful enjoyment of the property.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d) An order of 
						recovery of possession of two stores occupied by the 
						defendant on the property.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiffs' case as 
						gleaned from the statement of claim accompanying the 
						writ of summons was that they are the administrators of 
						the estate of their father, Opanin Yaw Koranteng. That 
						in his lifetime, he purchased a piece of land, the 
						subject matter of the dispute together with buildings a 
						thereon from the United African Company (UAC); that the 
						transaction was evidenced by a Deed of Assignment 
						executed by the UAC and Yaw Koranteng which Deed was 
						duly registered; that Yaw Koranteng entrusted the care 
						of the property to his elder brother, Kwame Addo, who 
						collected rents, accounted to him and occupied a store 
						on the premises for which he paid no rents.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">According to them, 
						their father exercised acts of ownership, receive rents 
						in respect of the property and turned down a request by 
						Opanin Kwame Addo to give a store he was occupying to 
						the defendant. In spite of these, they claimed, the 
						defendant did not only move occupy the store in question 
						upon the death of his father, but additionally laid 
						adverse claims to the property and instructed the 
						tenants in occupation to pay rents to him without 
						accounting to the plaintiffs. It is their case that such 
						conduct constituted a denial of their title to the 
						property.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In resisting the claim, 
						the defendant averred that it was his father, Opanin 
						Kwame Addo who 1st settled in Asamankese and 
						subsequently invited his brother to join him in his 
						trading activities; when his father moved to Agona 
						Swedru; he left his store for his brother, Yaw 
						Koranteng. In the course of time, Opanin Kwame Addo 
						purchased the property in dispute, paid for it and was 
						issued with a receipt; he thereafter verified his 
						ownership thereof by an affidavit and exercised all acts 
						of ownership including collecting rents&#8212;putting up 
						additional structures and ejecting a son of Opanin Yaw 
						Koranteng from one of the stores.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">According to him, at a 
						family meeting convened by his father at which Opanin 
						Yaw Koranteng was present, the property was gifted to 
						him, he performed the customary thanksgiving by 
						slaughtering a sheep and offering some drinks which all 
						the members of the family shared, and that the property 
						thereafter became vested in him and therefore denied the 
						claims made by the plaintiffs.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">These issues were set 
						down for determination by the parties:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1. whether or not the 
						property in question belonged to the late Yaw Koranteng.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2. whether or not the 
						property was given as a gift to the defendant by his 
						late father.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3. whether or not the 
						plaintiffs are entitled to their claim.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">4.&nbsp; whether or not the 
						Deed of Assignment numbered 1814/1974 is sufficient 
						proof of title of late Yaw Koranteng.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">5. whether or not it 
						was Opanin Kwame Addo who settled Opanin Yaw Koranteng 
						at Asamankese.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">6.&nbsp; whether or not 
						Opanin Kwame Addo was of good financial standing at the 
						date of sale of the property, in issue.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In dismissing the 
						plaintiffs' claim, the learned Judge stated 'the action 
						fails and I proceed to dismiss it. The status quo ante 
						is hereby restored. There would be costs in favour of 
						the defendant in the sum of 8 million cedis. Action 
						dismissed'. It is obvious that the decision did not find 
						favour with the plaintiffs; for on the 29th of October 
						2002, they launched an attack against it by filing a 
						Notice of Appeal consisting of these grounds:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;1. The entire judgment 
						was against the weight of evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2. The learned trial 
						judge erred in law in holding the property in question 
						was gifted by defendant's father to the defendant after 
						finding that the plaintiffs' father was legal owner of 
						same.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3. The learned judge 
						erred in holding that the plaintiffs' father was 
						estopped from claiming his property when his brother 
						attempted to give it away as a gift to defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">4. The trial judge was 
						wrong in holding that the sheep slaughtered was 'aseda' 
						sheep for a gift that was made.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">5.&nbsp; That the learned 
						trial judge misdirected himself as to the law resulting 
						in miscarriage of justice to the plaintiff/appellants.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is evident that the 
						main issues, which confronted the learned judge at the 
						trial, were a mixture of law and facts and he made 
						specific findings on them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Generally, it is the 
						primary duty of an appellate court in an appeal largely 
						based on findings of fact to carefully examine the 
						record of proceedings and to satisfy itself as to 
						whether the evidence on record supports the findings. 
						Even though it is ordinarily within the competency of a 
						trial judge to make findings of specific facts and an 
						appellate Court should hasten rather slowly in 
						disturbing same, a finding of fact which is an inference 
						to be drawn from specific facts found is within the 
						competency of an Appeal Court no less than a trial 
						Court. In other words, an Appeal Court is in as good a 
						position as the trial Court to draw inferences from 
						specific facts, which the trial Court may find. Adorkor 
						vrs. Akatsi 1966/GLR.31.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Again, even though an 
						appellate Court is not at liberty to usurp the province 
						of the trial Court, yet if the evidence be such that 
						only one conclusion could be properly drawn, an 
						appellate Court could be entitled to draw that 
						conclusion. Domfeh vrs. Adu 1984-86 GLR.655.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Indeed in Koglex vrs. 
						Field 2000 SC.GLR. 1 75, the Supreme Court set out the 
						circumstances under which findings of fact made by the 
						trial judge could properly be interfered with. Among 
						them are:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1. where the said 
						findings of the trial Court are clearly unsupported by 
						evidence on record or where the reasons in support of 
						the findings are unsatisfactory. Kyiafi vrs. Wono 1967 
						GLR.463.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2. Improper application 
						of a principle of evidence or where the trail Court has 
						failed to draw an irresistible conclusion from the 
						evidence. Fofie vrs. Zanyo 1992 2 GLR.475.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3.&nbsp; where the findings 
						are based on a wrong proposition of law and.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">4.&nbsp; where the finding 
						is inconsistent with crucial documentary evidence on 
						record.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I propose to address 
						the issues raised in this appeal in the order of 
						presentation by both learned Counsel.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">With regard to the 
						additional ground, namely, that the learned judge 
						misdirected himself on the burden assumed by the 
						plaintiff in an action for Declaration of title to land; 
						he submitted that with the enactment of the Evidence 
						Decree NRCD.323, a party in a civil action assumed the 
						burden of proof by a preponderance of probabilities and 
						not beyond reasonable doubt as held by the judge. 
						According to him, allocating a higher degree of proof 
						therefore, and basing the decision thereon, occasioned a 
						miscarriage of justice.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the course of the 
						judgment, the learned judge made this pronouncement 'in 
						the case of Kponuglo vrs. Kodaja 1933 2 WACA 24 at page 
						25, Lord Alness referring to the onus of proof of title 
						said that it was the onus of demonstrating beyond 
						reasonable doubt that title to the disputed land is in 
						him .....The position is that the evidence adduced by 
						the plaintiff is such that it fails to demonstrate 
						beyond reasonable doubt that title to the disputed 
						property is in the plaintiffs. This means the plaintiffs 
						have failed to discharge the onus of establishing title 
						to the disputed property.' </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is obvious from the 
						above that the learned judge took the view that the 
						plaintiffs were under a duty to prove beyond reasonable 
						doubt that title was vested in them and that since they 
						failed to attain that standard, their action failed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is not disputed that 
						there is a long line of cases which established that a 
						plaintiff in an action for declaration of title assumed 
						the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt, it is 
						however evident that since the enactment of the Evidence 
						Decree, particularly Sections 11(2)(4) and 12 thereof, 
						the degree of proof in a civil action is by 
						preponderance of the probabilities as opposed to proof 
						beyond reasonable doubt as in a criminal case, and that 
						in the case of the former, the degree remains the same 
						irrespective of whether the Civil action is for a 
						declaration of title to land or defamation. I am 
						fortified in this view by the holding in the Supreme 
						Court case of Adwubeng vrs. Domfeh (1996-97) SC. 670 
						where Acquah JSC as he then was stated 'before the 
						coming into force of the Evidence Decree 1975 NRCD.323, 
						on the 1st of October, 1976, a host of respectable 
						decisions had firmly established such a standard of 
						proof for titles to land. Kponuglo vrs. Kodaja 1933. 
						WACA 24 and Kodilinye vrs. Odu 1935 2 WACA 336. But the 
						Evidence Decree 1975, has imposed proof beyond 
						reasonable doubt only on prosecutions in criminal 
						actions Sec. 11(2) while Sec 11 (4) and 12 clearly

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Since it is evident 
						that there was an improper application of a principle of

						principle of evidence. Koglex vrs. Field Supra.'</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Learned Counsel further 
						submitted that the judgment was against the weight of 
						evidence since there was no basis for the preference of 
						the witnesses for the defendant to those of the 
						plaintiffs; especially in the light of the fact that 
						exhibit 'B' was clear on the ownership of the property 
						and that position was confirmed by Exhibit '2'.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In reply learned 
						Counsel for the defendant submitted that there was 
						sufficient evidence on record to support the decision 
						since it was clear from the receipt and the 
						correspondence that the property was purchased by Opanin 
						Kwame Addo.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have no doubts in my 
						mind that the late Opanin Kwame Addo and Yaw Koranteng 
						had a very good relationship as brothers; for their 
						younger sister, Margaret Yaa Adjeiwaah (PW2) said 'they 
						were very fine with each other'. It is in evidence that 
						initially, they settled at Asamankese before Opanin 
						Kwame Addo moved to Agona Swedru where he lived, 
						acquired some other properties aside from the disputed 
						one.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is not controverted 
						that negotiations for the purchase of the property were 
						carried out by Opanin Kwame Addo, for the various 
						correspondence on the issue bore his name; Exhibits 
						1B-1H. In all these correspondence the main characters 
						were Opanin Kwame Addo and the United Africa Company. In 
						Exhibit I D, for instance, appears the following: 'We 
						refer to your letter of 21st August 1971 offering the 
						sum of N¢9000 for the purchase of the above property and 
						are pleased to advise you that after careful 
						consideration your offer is acceptable subject to 
						contract.'</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After the negotiations 
						the purchase price was paid and the receipt dated the 
						20th of September 1971 bearing the name of Opanin Kwame 
						Addo was issued.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Before the issuance of 
						the receipt however, Opanin Kwame Addo deposed to an 
						affidavit on the 18th of September, 1971. Since it is 
						crucial, I wish to quote the relevant portions.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;1. I am the true and 
						lawful purchaser of all that piece or parcel of land 
						with buildings thereon ER 500/S.A.66. Situate lying and 
						being at Agona Swedru.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2.&nbsp; That cash the sum 
						of N¢9000 being purchase price has been paid in my name 
						to the United African Company Ghana Ltd. and valid 
						receipt obtained.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3. That all documents 
						bearing my name Opanin Kwame Addo in respect of the 
						aforementioned property should now bear the name of my 
						brother Opanin Yaw Koranteng.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the light of the 
						foregoing circumstances Supra explained, I swear to this 
						affidavit verifying my true and lawful claim as the 
						brother of Opanin Yaw Koranteng and that all documents 
						or documents pertaining to the purchase of all that 
						piece or parcel of land with buildings thereon which 
						bear my name Opanin Kwame Addo should now bear the name 
						of 'Opanin Yaw Koranteng.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After this deposition, 
						Exhibit 'B', the Deed of Assignment was executed; the 
						parties thereto were the United Africa Company and 
						Opanin Yaw Koranteng. Opanin Kwame Addo significantly 
						witnessed it. The issue which confronted the learned 
						judge was the weight to be attached to these documents 
						i.e. the receipt, Exhibit 1A, the affidavit, Exhibit '2' 
						and the Deed of Assignment, Exhibit 'B'. Needless to 
						say, he took the view that despite the existence of 
						exhibit 'B&quot; the surrounding circumstances showed that 
						the property belonged to Opanin Kwame Addo.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned judge 
						observed inter alia 'legally speaking, replacing Opanin 
						Kwame Addo's name, on the suggestion of Kwame Addo would 
						mean a transfer of interest in the property to Opanin 
						Yaw Koranteng, but critically examined against the 
						background of circumstances surrounding the whole 
						transaction and the entire correspondence relating to 
						the purchase . . .</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We would say that the 
						replacement of the actual purchaser's name was not an 
						accident but was truly arranged by the two deceased 
						brothers to deceive the public.'</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is evident from the 
						above that the learned judge had no doubts that exhibit 
						B, the Deed of Assignment carried very serious legal 
						consequences and that it would be extremely difficult to 
						avoid its weight, he therefore, unfortunately, strayed 
						into extraneous matters which were not clearly borne out 
						by the evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The affidavit was sworn 
						at Agona Swedru on the 18th of September 1971. In the 
						2nd paragraph, the deponent described himself as the 
						true purchaser of the property and immediately 
						thereafter deposed to the fact that the purchase price 
						was paid &#8216;in my name&#8217; and a valid receipt obtained. The 
						receipt is dated the 20th of September 197l. If 
						reference to the receipt in the affidavit (paragraph 3) 
						was to exhibit 1A, whose date significantly is the 20&quot;, 
						it is obvious that at the time of the deposition, the 
						receipt had not been obtained and therefore that 
						deposition was false.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Again in the same 
						(paragraph i.e.) there was this deposition that the 
						money was &quot;paid in my name&quot;. What is the significance of 
						the phrase underlined? Is it interchangeable with, I 
						paid the money? It is my considered view that to perform 
						an act in one's name implies that the action is done on 
						account or on behalf of some other person. In other 
						words the person in whose name the action is done is not 
						necessarily the beneficiary or owner. If the money was 
						provided by Opanin Kwame Addo, why was there the need 
						for him to have averred that the money was paid in his 
						name?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In paragraph 4; he was 
						emphatic that all documents pertaining to the purchase 
						should be made in the name of his brother. If he did 
						direct that all documents bearing his name in respect of 
						the property should now bear his brother's name; surely 
						all documents pertaining to the purchase would include 
						the receipts and all correspondence on the purchase; It 
						was subsequent to this that Exhibit B; the Deed of 
						Assignment was made. What is the effect of the 
						affidavit, particularly in relation to the Deed of 
						Assignment? As indicated the fact that he asserted that 
						the money was paid in his name was suggestive of the 
						fact the purchase was done on behalf of some other 
						person. Assuming it could be argued that ownership was 
						vested in him by virtue of the averment in paragraph 2, 
						the subsequent paragraphs evinced an intention to convey 
						same to Opanin Yaw Koranteng.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A Deed has been 
						described in Words and Phrases Legally Defined, the 2nd 
						Edition page 27 as a &quot;most solemn and authentic act that 
						a man can possibly perform, with relation to the 
						disposal of his property and therefore man shall always 
						be estopped by his own deed, or nor permitted to aver or 
						prove anything in contradiction to what he has once so 
						solemnly or deliberately avowed&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Indeed this position 
						was amplified in Sec 25 of NRCD.323 which is provides: 
						'Except as otherwise provided by law, including a rule 
						of equity the facts recited in a written documents are 
						conclusively presumed to be true as between the parties 
						to the instrument or the successors in interest.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Therefore assuming one 
						takes the position that the affidavit verified Opanin 
						Kwame Addo's ownership of the property, by his 
						subsequent act of instructing that all the documents be 
						made in his brother's name and actually witnessing the 
						brother's signature on the Deed of Assignment, he did 
						effectively divest himself of his ownership thereof. The 
						evidence led on the role of Opanin Fordjour in the whole 
						drama apparently swayed the learned judge. I must say 
						that the weight he attached to that piece of evidence 
						was underserving, for it is unlikely that Opanin Forjour 
						would demand to be given a portion of the land for 
						giving information about its sale, but more importantly, 
						in the face of exhibit B; the parol evidence, on Opanin 
						Fordjour's role should have been given little or no 
						weight; for it is a cardinal rule of construction that 
						parol evidence is inadmissible to add to; contradict, 
						vary or alter the terms of a Deed or any written 
						instrument. I must say that this rule applies to all 
						extrinsic evidence with a few exceptions. The 
						circumstances of this case however do not afford any 
						such exception. For when parties have recorded their 
						agreement in an instrument, it is in the interest of all 
						parties to presume that the instrument records the full 
						and final intentions of the parties.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I am of the view that 
						Exhibit 'B' established Yaw Koranteng as the owner. The 
						receipt on its own does not establish ownership, neither 
						can it be given the same weight as a Deed of Assignment 
						having regard to the deposition in the affidavit and my 
						observations thereon. Aside from the documentary 
						evidence, there were witnesses called by the plaintiffs; 
						who were significantly members of family of the deceased 
						brothers and who had personal knowledge of the events as 
						opposed to the witnesses called by the defendant who 
						were obviously interested parties.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The younger sister of 
						the deceased parties was emphatic that the property 
						belonged to Opanin Koranteng, her evidence on the 
						meeting at which Opanin Koranteng rejected the proposal 
						made by Opanin Kwame Addo to hand over the store to the 
						defendant was corroborated in every material particular 
						by PWS 2 &amp; 3 the head of the Kwahu Community in Agona 
						Swedru and Opanin Kwame Addo's nephew and successor 
						respectively. It is of significance that the latter 
						actually lived with Opanin Kwame Addo for over 1 0 
						years.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Against these pieces of 
						evidence offered by the plaintiffs' witnesses were those 
						offered by the defendant's aunt, child and sister who 
						cannot be described as disinterested parties.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In preferring the 
						evidence of the defendant's witnesses to those of the 
						plaintiffs, the learned trial described the evidence of 
						the latter as unreliable, contradictory and adduced only 
						to serve the interests of the plaintiffs.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A careful reading of 
						the proceedings does not reveal the basis for these. It 
						is my considered view that the findings of the learned 
						judge are indeed inconsistent with the documentary 
						evidence and cannot be supported by the evidence on 
						record. The attack mounted against the judgment on that 
						score is therefore sustainable.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As to whether the 
						learned judge erred in holding that the property in 
						question was gifted by the defendant's father to the 
						defendant after finding that the plaintiff's father was 
						the legal owner, undoubtedly, the learned judge made a 
						finding that the replacement of the name constituted a 
						transfer, but however relied on extraneous matters, 
						regrettably, to make a finding that it was a ruse by the 
						two deceased brothers to deceive the public. These 
						findings have no basis in the record of proceedings.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As to whether a gift of 
						the property was made to the defendant; all the 
						witnesses for the plaintiffs were agreed that no such 
						gift was made because Opanin Yaw Koranteng, who left the 
						meeting in anger, rebuffed the attempt 3 of the 
						witnesses for the defendant claimed they were present 
						and that a gift was made. The learned judge preferred 
						the evidence of the defendant's witnesses to those of 
						the plaintiffs; he described them as unreliable and 
						without attempting at demons- trating what informed that 
						opinion. Though the question of impressiveness or 
						otherwise, conviction etc are products of credibility 
						and veracity and that a court becomes convinced or 
						otherwise with the oral evidence according to the 
						opinion it forms of the veracity of the witnesses and 
						therefore a court of 1st instance is in a better 
						position than the appellate court, it is settled that 
						where the appellate court is satisfied that the reasons 
						given by the trial court in support of its findings are 
						not satisfactory or where it irresistibly appears to the 
						appellate court that the trial court has not taken 
						proper advantage of having seen or heard the witnesses, 
						the matter becomes at large. Kyiafi vrs. Wono 1967 
						GLR.463. In the case under consideration the learned 
						judge could not show the conflicts and contradictions in 
						the pieces of evidence of the witnesses of the 
						plaintiffs, indeed I found none. Even though the sister 
						of the deceased persons and the nephews who were old 
						enough to have appreciated the significance of the 
						events and were not shaken in cross-examination, 
						testified that no such gift was made and that the 
						slaughtering of the sheep had nothing to do with aseda, 
						the learned judge rejected those for the evidence of the 
						son of the defendant who was 12 years old at the time 
						and a witness who admitted she was not at the meeting. 
						At any rate since the property did not belong to Opanin 
						Kwame Addo, he had nothing to give. Nemo Dat quod non 
						Habet.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is my view that that 
						it is not sufficient for a trial court to trot out, as 
						it were the fact that one was unimpressed with a witness 
						without attempting at giving a basis for that expression 
						of opinion. For these reasons I would allow the appeal 
						on this ground as well.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In conclusion
