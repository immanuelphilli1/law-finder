												JUDGMENT</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												BROBBEY, JA.:&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This action started at the 
												Sekondi High Court where the 
												respondent was the plaintiff and 
												the appellant was the defendant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The plaintiff claimed two 
												reliefs. The first was for an 
												order for the payment of 
												thirty-one million, five hundred 
												thousand cedis being agreed 
												compensation for preventing the 
												plaintiff from using his petrol 
												station for business since 1990. 
												The second was an order for the 
												payment of interest on that sum 
												at the rate of 45% per annum 
												from 1st September until the 
												date of payment. After evidence 
												had been taken in a full trial, 
												judgment was given in favour of 
												the plaintiff.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The defendants, hereafter 
												referred to as the appellants, 
												then appealed to this court. 
												Their original grounds of appeal 
												were as follows.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;(a) The learned trial judge 
												erred in giving judgment for the 
												plaintiff having regard to the 
												evidence on record.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) The learned trial judge 
												erred in awarding interest on 
												the said sum.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; The learned trial judge 
												erred in awarding cost of three 
												million cedis.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(d) Additional grounds of appeal 
												will be filed on receipt of the 
												record of appeal&#8221; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Four additional grounds of 
												appeal were filed and these were 
												that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;(D) The learned trial judge 
												erred in law in not dismissing 
												the plaintiff&#8217;s claim as the 
												same ought to have been 
												evidenced in writing as it was a 
												matter affecting an interest in 
												land</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(E) the learned trial judge 
												erred in not having the case 
												sent to the High Court, Tarkwa, 
												when an objection to its 
												jurisdiction in terms of venue 
												had been raised.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(F) The learned trial judge's 
												evaluation of the evidence was 
												wrong and thereby erred in 
												giving judgment for the 
												plaintiff.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(G) The learned trial judge 
												should have dismissed the 
												plaintiff&#8217;s claims, as it was 
												clear that the judgment in 
												exhibit B of suit No. Ls 18/95 
												and entitled J.K. Ntrakwa v. G. 
												P. R. T. U. was wrong and that 
												the same could not be relied 
												upon.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In his statement of case, 
												counsel for the appellant argued 
												grounds A and F together. He 
												started by contending that the 
												plaintiff&#8217;s case was based on a 
												previous action in the High 
												Court. But that action was 
												instituted in the name of one 
												&#8220;J.K. Ntrakwa&#8221; while the 
												plaintiff in the instant case 
												was called &#8220;Solomon Ntrakwa.&#8221; 
												The plaintiff in the instant 
												case could not use that judgment 
												because that name did not refer 
												to him. The plaintiff 
												sufficiently explained that 
												issues in his evidence when he 
												averred that that was his 
												father&#8217;s name and further that 
												it was his father who commenced 
												the action before he continued 
												it. The plaintiff&#8217;s evidence on 
												that issue was equally 
												sufficient answer to the point 
												made by the appellant when he 
												said that exhibit A in which a 
												demand was made for the unpaid 
												amount was written on behalf of 
												J.K. Ntrakwa and not Solomon 
												Ntrakwa.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Another point made on behalf of 
												the appellant was that Shell 
												Company and not the respondent 
												or his father operated the 
												station. That did not help the 
												plaintiff's case. This is 
												because in this country petrol 
												stations are operated on behalf 
												of oil companies like Shell 
												Company. The companies 
												themselves do not run stations. 
												This is a fact so notorious that 
												judicial notice can be taken of 
												it. In any case, the appellant 
												has admitted paying rent to the 
												respondent, and not Shell 
												Company. That fact is an 
												admission that the appellants 
												accepted the respondent as the 
												one with authority to negotiate 
												business in respect of the land 
												in question. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel for the appellant also 
												argued that the PW1 who 
												testified for the plaintiff was 
												the plaintiff&#8217;s brother in law 
												and therefore his evidence 
												should not have weighed much on 
												the trial judge or should have 
												been disregarded. The answer to 
												that submission is that the mere 
												fact that a witness is related 
												to a party is no ground for the 
												evidence of that witness to be 
												rejected or disregarded. That 
												rule seems to have been 
												originated in the case of ADAI 
												v. ANANE [1973] 1 GLR 144 in 
												which the late Osei-Hwere J (as 
												he then was) held (in the head 
												note of the report) that</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;A plaintiff in an action for a 
												declaration of title assumed the 
												very heavy burden of proof and 
												he could not discharge that onus 
												by merely calling his relations 
												to support his evidence. To do 
												so would invite the failure of 
												his case.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												That statement was often cited 
												as authority for the proposition 
												that a party could not rely on 
												his relations to prove his case. 
												Whether or not that was the 
												ratio decidendi in that case was 
												not clear. In any case, that 
												view was depreciated in NKAEGUO 
												v. KUNADU [1974] 2 GLR 150 at 
												157 where it was held that</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;I doubt whether ADAI&#8217;S case 
												cited by learned counsel for the 
												plaintiff laid down any such 
												general principle of law that it 
												is incompetent to prove a fact 
												in issue by calling a relation. 
												If it did then it is 
												respectfully submitted that it 
												is a dangerous principle and 
												should be rejected because the 
												position of each witness must be 
												determined on it own peculiar 
												facts.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the other hand, in TANKO v. 
												KARAMI [1989-90] 2 GLR189,CA., 
												where a witness gave evidence 
												with a motive to help his 
												friend, it was held that the 
												court was entitled to place no 
												weight on that evidence. </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What may be said to be deducible 
												from the decided cases is this: 
												There is no general principle to 
												the effect that the evidence of 
												a witness should be rejected 
												merely because the witness is 
												related to the party on whose 
												behalf he testifies. Whether the 
												evidence should be rejected or 
												accepted depends on the facts 
												and circumstances of each case. 
												Where the only witness available 
												on an issue is a person related 
												to one party, to reject his 
												evidence on the grounds that the 
												witness is related to that party 
												will sometimes not only prevent 
												that party from making his case 
												but may also deny him justice, 
												as it was held in NKAEGUO v. 
												KUNADU, supra. In that case, all 
												but one of witnesses to the 
												demarcation of a piece of land 
												were dead, that one being the 
												defendant&#8217;s sister who testified 
												for him. The argument that her 
												testimony should be rejected on 
												account only of the fact of the 
												relationship was overruled.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The evidence of a witness who is 
												a relation is no doubt to be 
												treated with caution for the 
												obvious reason that it is said 
												that blood is thicker than 
												water. It cannot be taken on its 
												face value like the evidence of 
												a witness who is no relation&nbsp; of 
												any of the parties. It has to be 
												examined to determine whether it 
												is tainted by bias, prejudice, 
												interest, motive etc. and it may 
												be rejected for any of these. If 
												none of these can be read into 
												the evidence, it may be 
												considered on the same basis 
												that any other evidence before 
												the court will be equally 
												examined.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the instant case, the PW1 
												quickly owned up in 
												cross-examination when asked 
												about his relationship with the 
												plaintiff and said that he was 
												the brother in law of the 
												plaintiff. At the same time he 
												told the court that he was a 
												member of the defendant Union. 
												He said he was at the meeting 
												where it was agreed that the 
												thirty-one million Cedis would 
												be paid by the appellants. His 
												evidence was subjected to 
												cross-examination and it was not 
												established that he harboured 
												any motive or had any&nbsp; bias or 
												interest because of his 
												relationship with the plaintiff. 
												It would appear that his 
												continued membership of the 
												defendant Union underscored his 
												neutrality and provided a 
												stronger ground for accepting 
												his evidence. If his relations 
												with the plaintiff could provide 
												a source of his interest in 
												favour of the plaintiff, his 
												membership of the Union could 
												also provide a source of 
												interest for the appellant's 
												cause. At the end of the trial 
												the trial judge who saw his 
												demeanour in the witness box 
												decided to believe him. The 
												evidence clearly supported the 
												findings of the trial judge on 
												this issue even though he 
												assigned no reason for the 
												conclusion he came to in respect 
												of the relationship of the PW1 
												with the plaintiff. That 
												notwithstanding, the trial judge 
												based much of his findings on 
												his observation of the demeanour 
												of the parties and their 
												witnesses, as counsel for the 
												respondent rightly pointed out 
												in his statement of case.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The well established rule is 
												that an appellate court is not 
												entitled to interfere with the 
												findings of fact made by a trial 
												judge unless those findings are 
												not supported by the evidence on 
												the record or that the judge did 
												not take all the circumstances 
												into account or that he 
												misapprehended the evidence or 
												drew inferences where there was 
												no evidence in support thereof. 
												There are several authorities in 
												support of these principles 
												including DARKWAH v DENTEH 
												[1972] 2 GLR 305,CA,&nbsp; IN RE 
												YENDI SKIN AFFAIRS: YAKUBU 11 v. 
												ABUDULAI (No. 2) [1984-86] 2 GLR 
												239, SC, LOG &amp; LUMBER LTD v. 
												OPPON [1977] 2 GLR 263,CA, PRAKA 
												v. KETEWA [1964] GLR 423, SC. In 
												the instant case, counsel for 
												the appellant has not been able 
												to show any error in the factual 
												findings made by the trial 
												judge, neither has he been able 
												to show that he made findings or 
												drew inferences which were not 
												supported by the evidence. For 
												these reasons, the grounds of 
												appeal based on weight of 
												evidence as contained in grounds 
												A of the original grounds and 
												ground F of the additional 
												grounds failed and are 
												dismissed. Direct authority in 
												support of this view is KYIAFI 
												v. WONO [1967] GLR 463, CA.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Ground B of the original grounds 
												of appeal concerned award of 
												interest. The plaintiff demanded 
												45% as interest on the amount 
												claimed in the writ. The trial 
												judge granted that rate of 
												interest to the plaintiff and 
												added that the interest was to 
												be exacted till the final 
												payment. No reason was assigned 
												by the judge for that award. The 
												evidence on the record cannot 
												sustain the award of 45% 
												interest on the amount claimed. 
												In the first place, neither the 
												plaintiff nor any of his 
												witnesses led any evidence on 
												the issue of interest. The rate 
												of 45 per cent was therefore 
												arbitrary. The mere fact that it 
												appeared in the writ of summons 
												was no reason for granting it. 
												In the second place, award made 
												by the trial judge was per 
												incuriam because there are 
												statutes governing the award of 
												interest by the courts but none 
												of them was considered or even 
												referred to. The award of 
												interest is now regulated by 
												Court's (Award of interest) 
												Instrument, 1984 (LI 1295).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The basis for the award of 
												interest is that the defendants 
												had unjustifiably kept money 
												belonging to the plaintiff. They 
												should not be allowed to keep 
												the money plus the profit that 
												would have accrued if the money 
												had been put to business. It is 
												that profit that is demanded as 
												interest from the defendant. In 
												the instant case, the trial 
												judge upheld the plaintiff&#8217;s 
												claim as appearing in his writ. 
												According to the plaintiff, the 
												amount became due in 1990. That 
												too was accepted by the trial 
												court when the court found that 
												the amount claimed in the writ 
												was due to the plaintiff, but 
												had been kept by the appellants 
												by reason of its non-payment, 
												interest became due on that 
												amount.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the basis of the principle 
												explained herein, the 
												respondents were entitled to 
												interest on that amount from 
												1990. The rate of interest 
												should however be at the 
												prevailing bank rate and on 
												simple interest basis as per the 
												terms of LI 1295. The rate of 45 
												per cent ordered by the trial 
												judge was wrong and should be 
												set aside. Interest in the terms 
												of LI 1295 is payable up to 
												today, the date of judgment. 
												After today and until the date 
												of final payment, interest is to 
												be at 4% in accordance with LN 
												140A, Order 42, r. 15, since 
												this case emanated from the High 
												Court. Of course, the prevailing 
												bank rates should be calculated 
												at all relevant times since they 
												differ from day to day.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Prior to the institution of the 
												instant action, the plaintiff&#8217;s 
												father had obtained a judgment 
												in the High Court presided over 
												by another judge. That judgment 
												decreed title in favour of his 
												father. Indeed, the instant 
												action was based on that 
												judgment. In ground G of the 
												additional grounds of appeal, 
												the appellant contended that 
												that judgment was wrong and that 
												it could not be relied upon. In 
												his statement of case, counsel 
												sought to sustain that ground by 
												attacking&nbsp; the merits of that 
												judgment. That was the wrong way 
												to impugn the judgment. The 
												defendants in that case were the 
												same defendants in the instant 
												case. They did not appeal 
												against it or attempt to set it 
												aside. Whatever issue they 
												wished to raise with that 
												judgment was already res 
												judicata. The judgment being one 
												delivered by a court of 
												competent jurisdiction is valid 
												and binding on the parties to 
												it, until it is set aside. 
												Ventilating criticism against it 
												in another case is not the 
												proper mode to set aside or 
												nullify a judgment of a court. 
												There is no merit in the 
												arguments canvassed in support 
												of that ground of appeal. It is 
												accordingly dismissed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In ground D of the additional 
												grounds of appeal, counsel for 
												the appellant contended that the 
												claim should have been dismissed 
												since it was not evidenced in 
												writing as required by the 
												Conveyancing Decree, 1973 (NRCD 
												175), s. 1. That section 
												provides that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;A transfer of an interest in 
												land shall be by a writing 
												signed by the person making the 
												transfer or by his agent duly 
												authorized in writing, unless 
												relieved against the need for 
												such a writing by the provisions 
												of section 3&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Section of that Decree also 
												provides that</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;2. No contract for the transfer 
												of an interest in land shall be 
												enforceable unless</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												a) it is evidenced in a writing 
												signed by the person against 
												whom the contract is to be 
												proved or by a person who was 
												authorized to sign on behalf of 
												such person&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												These sections deal with the 
												sale or transfer of ownership or 
												interest in land or contract in 
												the sale or interest in land. 
												Quite clearly, the sections are 
												inapplicable to the facts of the 
												instant case. The plaintiff&#8217;s 
												case was based on the fact that 
												the defendants had prevented him 
												from using his land as a petrol 
												station. The claim was 
												compensation for that 
												prevention. It was not for the 
												passing of any interest in the 
												land from anyone to anyone. If 
												any interest was discoverable 
												from the facts, it was interest 
												vested in the plaintiff himself 
												as landlord to use his own land 
												by himself. That the plaintiff 
												was the landlord was beyond 
												dispute as the defendant pays 
												rent to the plaintiff. If that 
												interest had to be in writing, 
												it could be seen in the 
												judgment, exhibit B.. Since the 
												relationship between the 
												plaintiff and defendants was 
												compensation, how could the 
												plaintiff have got the 
												defendants to have signed a 
												document or merely to have 
												agreed to sign a document that 
												the defendants were preventing 
												the plaintiff from using the 
												land as a petrol station? That 
												would not only have been 
												unrealistic. It would have been 
												absurd. If there were any such 
												requirement, at what stage were 
												they to sit down to sign such an 
												agreement or writing&#8212; before the 
												prevention, during the 
												prevention or after the 
												prevention? Ground D also failed 
												as unmeritorious and should be 
												dismissed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In ground E, the appellants 
												contended that the trial judge 
												erred in not transferring the 
												case to the Tarkwa High Court 
												when objection was raised in 
												terms of the venue. When counsel 
												for the appellants argued this 
												ground, he contended that all 
												the parties and their witnesses 
												were resident in Bogosu which 
												was under the Tarkwa High Court. 
												He relied on the High Court 
												(Civil Procedure) Amendment 
												Rules, 1977(LI 1107), rr. 1, 3, 
												5 or 6. The relevant Rules are 
												as follows;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;(1) Every writ of summons shall 
												be issued out of the Registry 
												and shall, without prejudice to 
												the provisions of section 99 of 
												the Courts Act, 1971 (Act 372) 
												be regulated in accordance with 
												this rule.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) All actions relating to 
												land, or any mortgage or charge 
												thereon or any other interest 
												therein or for any injury 
												thereto, shall be commenced in 
												the Region in which the land or 
												any part thereof is situated.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3) All actions relating to 
												movable property distrained or 
												seized for any cause shall be 
												commenced in the Region in which 
												the distress or seizure took 
												place.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(4) All actions for recovery of 
												a penalty or forfeiture, and all 
												actions against public officers, 
												shall be commenced in the Region 
												in which the cause of action 
												arose</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(5) All actions for specific 
												performance or upon the beach of 
												any contract, shall be commenced 
												in the Region in which such 
												contract ought to have been 
												performed or in which the 
												defendant resides.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(6) All other actions shall be 
												commenced in the Region in which 
												the defendant resides or carries 
												on his business</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is obvious that the emphasis 
												in these rules is on the Region 
												where the cause of action arose 
												or the Region where the subject- 
												matter is situated or where the 
												defendants reside. Bogosu, where 
												the land in question is 
												situated, Sekondi where the case 
												was actually tried and Tarkwa to 
												which application was made for 
												the case to be transferred are 
												all situated in the Western 
												Region. The Rules would seem to 
												have been complied with. On the 
												face of the law, that ground of 
												appeal cannot be sustained and 
												therefore failed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A critical examination of the 
												record reveals that the trial 
												judge should have referred the 
												case to His Lordship the Chief 
												Justice to be transferred. The 
												reason for this was simply this: 
												All the parties reside and work 
												at Bogosu. All the witnesses 
												reside and work at Bogosu. The 
												land in respect of which the 
												petrol station would have been 
												operated is situated at Bogosu. 
												Next door to Bogosu is Tarkwa 
												where there is a High Court. To 
												bypass that court and institute 
												action in Sekondi, which is 
												several miles away from the 
												locus in quo and quite far from 
												where the parties and their 
												witnesses live and work, may 
												have the tendency for any 
												objective onlooker to suspect 
												the actions of the plaintiff. 
												What was his motive in going so 
												far away from where the action 
												could more conveniently have 
												been tried? One would have 
												thought that the rationale for 
												opening courts in several areas 
												was to bring justice to the 
												people and to make it convenient 
												for people to litigate in areas 
												closest to them. What the 
												plaintiff did in this case 
												defeats the very object of 
												bringing justice to the people. 
												Even if the law was on the side 
												of the plaintiff, the venue he 
												selected to prosecute this case, 
												having regard to the proximity 
												of the court he bypassed, cannot 
												go without comment.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial judge made matters 
												worse by the reason he assigned 
												for overruling the objection 
												raised against his court as the 
												venue for the trial of the case. 
												In his ruling, he stated that</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The matter in controversy or 
												issue here is as to whether the 
												defendants agreed to pay the 
												plaintiff the amount being 
												claimed in this action. I 
												believe that this is a 
												straightforward issue and can be 
												expeditiously dealt with in this 
												court. Application for transfer 
												is therefore overruled&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What made him believe that the 
												matter could not be 
												expeditiously dealt with at 
												Tarkwa? The trial judge could 
												not be right that the trial 
												would be more expeditious in 
												Sekondi where the parties and 
												their witnesses had to travel 
												longer distances to get to court 
												than Tarkwa where the distances 
												were much shorter.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Ground C of the original grounds 
												of appeal was that the trial 
												judge erred in awarding cost of 
												three million cedis for the 
												respondents. The appellant or 
												his counsel canvassed no 
												arguments on that ground. The 
												general principle is that the 
												award of cost is the discretion 
												of the trial judge. This is 
												emphasized in LN 140a, order 65, 
												r. 1. The discretion should 
												however be exercised judicially, 
												having regard to the amount of 
												work put in the preparation and 
												conduct of the case as well as 
												the time taken by the court and 
												the parties in completing the 
												trial.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial of the instant case 
												did not last long. It was 
												started in December 1997 and was 
												concluded within seven months. 
												Judgment was given in July 1998. 
												There were no complicated 
												pleadings and only three 
												exhibits were tendered. Having 
												regard to the shortness of the 
												trial, the speed at which the 
												case was disposed of in the 
												court and the simplicity of the 
												pleadings, the award of three 
												million cedis as cost was rather 
												on the high side, amounting to 
												almost ten per cent of the total 
												claim in the writ.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												If the plaintiff was put out of 
												pocket by the fact that he had 
												to travel with his witnesses to 
												the distant trial court, that 
												was his own making because he 
												did not have to prosecute the 
												claim at Sekondi, for the 
												reasons already stated. Such 
												self-imposed hardship or 
												needless expenditure cannot 
												justifiably ground the award of 
												heavy cost. For instance, in 
												SASRAKU v. DAVID AND ORS. [1959] 
												GLR 7, at 12, CA, the engagement 
												of an Accra based lawyer who had 
												to make frequent journeys to 
												Kumasi in order to conduct court 
												trial in that case was held to 
												be no justification for the 
												award of two thousand guineas 
												costs which at that time was 
												found to be manifestly 
												excessive. In all the 
												circumstances of this case, 
												three million cedis was 
												excessive and should be reduced. 
												The ground of appeal relating to 
												cost succeeds and should be 
												allowed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the end, ground C of the 
												original ground of appeal is 
												wholly allowed. Ground B of the 
												original grounds of appeal 
												relating to interest is allowed 
												in part. All the other original 
												and additional grounds of appeal 
												fail and are dismissed.</span></p>
