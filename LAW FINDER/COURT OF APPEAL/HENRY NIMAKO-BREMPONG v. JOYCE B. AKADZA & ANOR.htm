						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff endorsed

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1) &quot;An order that the 
						part of the perimeter wall around 1st Defendant's house 
						at Nungua-Buade in Accra straddles or is built on the 
						space demarcated as part (western) part of the access 
						road lying and being between the first defendant's said 
						house and that move freely to and from his (plaintiff's) 
						said house.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2) General damages&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The parties are 
						adjoining landowners and the case for the plaintiff was 
						that the space between their houses was demarcated for 
						an access road by the authorities. The first defendant 
						built and extended her fence wall onto the access road 
						so much that it was only about a meter away from the 
						house of the plaintiff. As a result vehicular movement 
						to and from the plaintiffs' house through the access 
						road became impossible. The plaintiff said he made a 
						report to the 2nd defendant who confirmed that the first 
						defendant wrongfully erected her wall at where she did 
						and marked it for removal. The first defendant did not 
						remove her wall and the second defendant did not compel 
						her to comply with the order to remove it either. The 
						plaintiff complained that action of the first defendant 
						was a cause of nuisance, embarrassment, inconvenience 
						and costs to him. For a redress, he put in the claims 
						mentioned above.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendants resisted 
						the plaintiffs claims. The first claimed that when she 
						started her building operation in 1989, the layout plan 
						of the area did not indicate that any access road passed 
						through her land. She went on to have a quit and 
						peaceable enjoyment and possession of her land till 1997 
						when she noticed that the plaintiff had also started his 
						building operation on an adjoining piece of land. Where 
						she had her building was not part of any access road.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At the summons for 
						directions, the issues agreed upon for trial were simply 
						&#8220;1. Whether or not an access road has been demarcated as 
						lying between plaintiff&#8217;s and 1st defendant&#8217;s respective 
						houses at Buade&#8221; and &#8220;2. Whether or not the 1st 
						defendant has in any way built on an access road or part 
						thereof&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned trial judge 
						took evidence from the parties and in his judgment 
						upheld the plaintiff&#8217;s claim. He ordered that the first 
						defendant should remove her wall or the plaintiff should 
						do so in order that both parties uses the access road, 
						to get to their respective houses.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Dissatisfied with the 
						decision, the first defendant brought an appeal against 
						it before this court. I shall now call the plaintiff the 
						respondent and the first defendant, the appellant. 
						Originally only one ground of appeal was filed. It was 
						the omnibus ground that the judgment was against the 
						weight of evidence. The additional grounds were that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1) The trial judge 
						erred in law by not dismissing the plaintiff&#8217;s writ of 
						summons as being inappropriate by virtue of the nature 
						of the reliefs claimed and the evidence adduced.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2) The trial judge 
						erred in law by not applying to the plaintiff the law on 
						the acquisition of Building Permit, particularly, 
						Regulations 3 and 7 of the National Building 
						Regulations, 1996, (LI 1630.)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3) The trial judge 
						misdirected himself by entering judgment for the 
						plaintiff/respondent when the plaintiff/respondent had 
						not asserted his title to the plot of land on which he 
						built his house for which he wanted an access road 
						through the 1st defendant's land. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(4) The trial judge 
						failed to make proper findings of fact because he 
						adopted a wrong procedure at the locus in quo 
						inspection&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellant submitted 
						that the joinder of AMA as a second defendant was wrong 
						for the reason that if the aim was to compel it to 
						demolish the first defendant's wall, then his remedy was 
						to apply to the High Court for an order of mandamus and 
						not to issue a writ of summons. What was more the 
						defendants did not do anything jointly and severally for 
						which they should be sued jointly and severally. For 
						having done so, the plaintiff's action was 
						inappropriate, incompetent, misconceived and not 
						properly before the trial court. The reply to this 
						submission was that from the relief sought from the 
						court, the procedure adopted by the plaintiff was 
						proper. Whether or not the respondent erred in joining 
						the parties together as he did, is a matter adequately 
						answered by the law.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Under LI. 1129, 
						misjoinder, non-joinder are not fatal or decision and 
						every case must be determined on its merits as they 
						relate to the parties before them: See Order 6 (1) of 
						the High Court (Civil Procedure) (Amendment) (No.2) 
						Rules l977, LI. 1129.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The procedure a party 
						ought to follow must not be divorced from the relief he 
						seeks from the court. In other words they are mutually 
						intertwined. Generally, under Order 2 rule 1 of the High 
						Court Procedure Rules, 1954, (L.N. 140A), all actions 
						are commenced by a writ of summons. The other forms 
						known and recognized by the rules apply to specific 
						subject matters and reliefs. Thus the prerogative orders 
						follows their own procedures and except where one seeks 
						any of those orders, one has no need to resort to the 
						procedure specified under those rules. The respondent 
						went to court for the specific remedies stated above, 
						namely, an order for the first defendant to demolish her 
						fence wall to enable him gain easy access to his house. 
						The other relief was for damages against the defendants 
						for causing the nuisance to him. Undoubtedly, there were 
						two defendants to the action; only the second was a 
						public authority. Most undeniably the prerogative orders 
						lie against public officers to compel them to effect or 
						discharge their public functions: Mould v. de Vine 
						[1962] 1 GLR 533 and IN RE A COMPLAINT TO POLICE BY 
						BOTWE AND MENSAH, [1957] GLR, 457. Such an order will 
						not lie against a private individual like the first 
						defendant. Secondly, general damages are not pursued 
						upon a prerogative, writ; they are awarded upon a writ 
						of summons. Where there are two or more defendants and 
						one of the two reliefs sought from the court is 
						cognizable under one particular mode of commencing an 
						action and the other is not, such as in this case, it is 
						reasonable to commence the action by a writ of summons. 
						Where a particular mode of commencing an action cannot 
						be used because it would not apply to one of two or more 
						defendants then it is reasonable to commence the action 
						by a mode that generally applies to all actions. In the 
						peculiar circumstances of this case, it was more 
						reasonable to commence the action under the general mode 
						of commencing an action than by any other. Because of 
						the fact that the respondent did not seek an order of 
						mandamus against the second defendant or any of the 
						defendants, and also because there was also a claim for 
						damages, the respondent did the right thing when he came 
						to court by a writ of summons.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the result 
						additional ground one fails. Above all, it cannot be 
						gain said that prerogative. Above all, it cannot be 
						again said that the respondent had the choice to issue a 
						writ of summons or seek a remedy under the prerogative 
						orders but this must not does not depend on the 
						circumstances of he had to explain. He made the claim 
						and this action should fall or stand according to the 
						merits of the case. The substance of additional ground 
						two was that the judge erred in not applying the effect 
						of regulations 3 and 7 of the National Building 
						Regulations, (L.I 1630). </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Those regulations 
						required that an applicant for a building permit has to 
						satisfy the District Planning Authority that he has a 
						good title to the land. The converse is that an 
						applicant who has no such good title will not have his 
						application granted. Counsel submitted that the 
						respondent failed to prove that he had a good title to 
						the land on which he built his house. He did not produce 
						the building permit he said he had, an indenture or a 
						Land Certificate. I understand counsel to be saying that 
						the respondent did not show or prove that he had any 
						good title to the land on which he built his house so he 
						had no building permit. I think the evidence showed that 
						even though the respondent did not tender any building 
						permit in evidence, he said in his oral evidence that he 
						had one. On this, he was corroborated by the PW 1, a 
						geodetic engineer of the AMA This witness went as far as 
						quoting the permit number being No. 323/97. The 
						remarkable thing about the evidence of PW1 on this was 
						that there was no cross-examination on it by counsel for 
						the appellants. The law was settled that where a party 
						gives evidence but was not cross-examined on it, the 
						inference was that what he said was admitted albeit sub 
						silentio. What has been admitted requires no further 
						proof.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">All things considered, 
						it is very doubtful if there was a real need for the 
						respondent to produce a building permit in the 
						circumstances of this case. At the center of the dispute 
						that sent the parties to court was whether or not the 
						first defendant&#8217;s fence wall obstructed and impeded the 
						access of the respondent to his house. That was the 
						issue that the trial judge had to grapple with. To 
						resolve that issue, it was not necessary for the 
						applicant to produce a permit to build his house or at 
						where he did. The onus was rather on the defendant to 
						show that where he put up the fence wall was where she 
						was permitted by the authorities to do so. The central 
						issue could be disposed of by looking at the layout to 
						see if any access road had been earmarked for the area 
						and if so whether or not the first defendant&#8217;s wall sat 
						or straddled it. Title to the land on which the 
						respondent&#8217;s house was, was of no moment as that was 
						neither in dispute nor was ancillary or incidental to 
						it. This was not an action for trespass to land; it must 
						be borne in mind. In short therefore, additional ground 
						2 did not weigh favourably with me; I am of the view 
						that it was irrelevant and was not meritorious. I 
						unhesitatingly dismiss it. So do I extend the same 
						consideration to additional ground 3 which I think is 
						substantially the same as the ground just dismissed. I 
						also dismiss that ground.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The ground of appeal 
						that seemed to call for a little consideration was 
						ground 4. Even there, I think that ground could be taken 
						together with the original ground that the judgment was 
						against the weight of the evidence. The question raised 
						is what is the proper procedure to adopt by the court in 
						a visit to the locus in quo? The most authoritative 
						statement on the practice on inspection of a locus in 
						quo was made in the Practice Note on Gblevi Family v. 
						Amanie [1961] GLR 1 at pp 1-2. I have decided to refer 
						at length to what was said in that note as counsel 
						submitted that neither the registrar nor the judge 
						himself adopted the procedure therein enshrined. It was 
						that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The court should be 
						accompanied by the parties and any relevant witnesses to 
						the inspection. The parties or the witnesses there point 
						out such places and things, which are material to the 
						case, etc. If certain other persons who may assist the 
						court in arriving at a decision in the matter are found 
						on the land, but who have not given evidence in the 
						court, are heard, those other persons should be asked to 
						appear before the court when it re-assembles.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Then when the court 
						re-assembles all the persons who were used at the view 
						must be put in the witness box, and on oath state what 
						part they took in the recent visit to the locus and what 
						each did.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The parties, that is 
						the plaintiff and the defendant are to be given an 
						opportunity of cross-examining those witnesses who after 
						the inspection are called by the court itself, and at 
						that stage must be deemed to be witnesses called at the 
						instance of the court.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Gblevie Family v. 
						Amanie (supra) was applied in Mansah v Donkor [1980] GLR 
						825 at p 829. I fail to see in what respect the trial 
						judge or the registrar did not follow the procedure in 
						that case, which compels me to draw the attention of 
						counsel to that fact that it was not enough to cite a 
						case in an address without specifying how relevant it 
						was either on a point of law or the facts of the case in 
						point. Where the allegation or complaint was that a 
						procedure was not followed, counsel owe it a duty to 
						tell the appellate court how the failure occurred. This 
						would enable the appellate court determine the chances 
						of the appeal succeeding at least on that ground. That 
						was very much so where the case relied upon mentioned 
						more than one procedure or what was to be done at the 
						inspection.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Viewing a locus in quo 
						affords an opportunity for the court to see at first 
						hand, what the real facts are on the ground. It aids and 
						provides the court an avenue for resolving disputes. It 
						is all the more so where there are no plans of the area 
						drawn and tendered in evidence. Thus, in Amane v. Kwabla 
						[1975] 1 GRL 417, the court said at p 421 that: &#8220;When a 
						court embarks upon an inspection of the locus in quo it 
						does so as part of the process in the hearing of the 
						case; it is a continuation of the hearing by 
						substitution of its eye for the ear in the reception of 
						evidence&#8221;. I shall presently come back to this case in 
						another context. Another reason for such visits is where 
						plans would not be enough to help in resolving the 
						dispute. In this case for example, the issue was where 
						the fence wall was on the ground. A mere plan of the 
						area would not be enough to tell the court where it was. 
						The judge was right in exercising his discretion to go 
						to the scene to see things himself as they were on the 
						ground; together with the oral and documentary evidence 
						before him, he would be in a good position to resolve 
						the dispute before him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">If I have any criticism 
						about how the judge handled the visit, it was how he 
						asked the Registrar of the court to inspect the land and 
						submit a report to him. It was imperative that the judge 
						visits the area in dispute in person instead of allowing 
						any body to do so for and on his behalf. I point it out 
						that such visits are part of receiving evidence that 
						would assist the court in discharging its duty of 
						finding what the primary facts of a case before him are. 
						This must not be delegated to any person at any stage of 
						the proceedings. It was not so in this case and I must 
						express my disapproval of how the judge abdicated his 
						functions to his registrar. This is not without a 
						precedent for a similar situation occurred in Amane v. 
						Kwabla (supra) where the trial magistrate commissioned 
						his court clerk and an assistant registrar to inspect 
						the land in dispute. The appellate High Court deprecated 
						such a procedure on the ground that it amounted to 
						altering the constitution of the court, an act that had 
						the effect of nullifying the trial. I hope that judges 
						(be they at the trial or appellate level), who are 
						desirous of visiting an area in dispute would not follow 
						this practice or procedure by asking their court clerks 
						or registrars or any other official to carry out an 
						inspection on their behalf and submit reports on them 
						for their use in court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Whatever one can say 
						against how the registrar went to the area in dispute, 
						what he did carried no weight for the trial judge 
						eventually went to the scene himself and thereby 
						obliterated whatever the registrar did. It also did not 
						appear from the judgment that what the registrar did 
						influence the judge in any way. There was an error in 
						what the judge did at first when he asked the registrar 
						to inspect the land and submit a report on it, but it 
						was of no material significance as to be a good ground 
						of appeal. I have no hesitation to dismiss that ground 
						of appeal as well.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The grounds that the 
						judgment was against the weight of evidence and that the 
						judge failed to make proper findings of facts deserve 
						some comments and would be taken together. An appeal on 
						these grounds is known to the law and its meaning has 
						been determined in Fofie v. Zanyo [1992] 2 GLR 475, SC; 
						Akufo-Addo v. Cathline [1992] GLR 377, SC. In Fofie v. 
						Zanyo (supra), the principles upon which this appellant 
						court proceeds to disturb findings of facts made by a 
						trial court are stated. The Supreme Court said that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The Scope and the 
						extent to which an appellant tribunal is permitted to 
						interfere with findings of facts made by a trial 
						tribunal are now too well settled to admit of any 
						dispute. The right is subject to the exclusive preserve 
						of a trial tribunal to make primary findings of fact, 
						and where such findings of fact are supported by 
						evidence on record and are based on the credibility of 
						witnesses when the trial tribunal has had the 
						opportunity and advantage of seeing and of observing 
						their demeanor and has become satisfied of the 
						truthfulness of their testimonies touching on any 
						particular matter in issue, and also where such findings 
						cannot be said to be wrong, it is incompetent for an 
						appeal court to interfere:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">See Oppong Kofi v. 
						Fofie [1964] GLR 174, SC, Praka v. Ketewa [1964] GLR 
						423, SC; Azagba v. Negov [1964] 450, SC and Asibey III 
						v. Ayisi [1973] 1 GLR 102.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Other cases worth 
						mentioning in connection herewith are Doku v. Doku 
						[1992-93] 1 GBR 367 CA, and Nsiah v. Atuahene [1992-93] 
						1 GBR 897, CA. Where appellant court could conclude from 
						the evidence or jugment that the findings are not 
						supported by the evidence, or that the preponderance of 
						the evidence heavily weighs against the findings, or the 
						inferences from the facts were wrong and the judgment 
						was against the weight of the evidence it would disturb 
						it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In such a situation the 
						appellant court would not be precluded from setting 
						aside the findings made and come out with its own. 
						Admittedly, the trial judge did make some findings of 
						facts that were basic and relevant to the issues at 
						stake. It was undisputed, as I have said that the 
						pivotal issue in the case was whether or not the 
						defendant&#8217;s fence wall was erected on a piece of land 
						earmarked for an access road in the area and for public 
						use. Who owned that place was irrelevant in this wise. 
						It was also irrelevant whether or not any of the 
						parties, i.e., the appellant or the respondent had a 
						better title to the land or a permit to put up a 
						building on that piece of land. Where owners of 
						adjoining houses dispute over such an issue in court 
						chances are that each would assert strenuously that he 
						was in the right. In such a situation, the evidence of 
						neutral persons like the proper authority to make such 
						demarcations for access roads in the area is often 
						decisive provided it could scale over all the tests of 
						admissibility and weight of evidence. That kind of 
						evidence was put before the judge. There was the oral 
						evidence of the geodetic engineer, PW 1, Mr. Fred 
						Aboagye Larbi and the documentary evidence in exhibit A, 
						the planning scheme to consider. I have deemed it fit 
						and proper to quote a chunk from the evidence of the PW 
						1 now, for it was very material. He said:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;My finding showed that 
						there was 20 feet access land in front of plaintiff's 
						land and a fence wall has been erected to block the 
						access lane. I made a plan of whole (sic) I found on the 
						ground; the ground situation.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">That plan was Exhibit G 
						accepted without any objection. Later on, the PW1 went 
						on to say in his evidence under cross-examination that 
						the first appellant had built on what should be an 
						access road and that if her wall was removed, the 20 
						feet land would be there.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In his judgment, the 
						trial found as facts that &#8220;by the general layout of the 
						area, Nungua-Buade, there is a 20 feet access lane 
						between plaintiff&#8217;s land and that of 1st defendant&#8217;s 
						land. I also find as a fact that part of 1st defendant&#8217;s 
						wall is constructed on the said access lane. This has 
						made it IMPOSSIBLE for any vehicular movement into 
						plaintiff&#8217;s house.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned judge went 
						on from there to enter judgment in favor of the 
						respondent and also made an order for the wall on the 20 
						feet of land on the access road to be removed by the 
						first appellant or pulled down by the respondent 
						(plaintiff) to enable both plaintiff and 1st appellant 
						use the access road to their respective houses. Costs 
						were awarded against only the appellant, not jointly and 
						severally. No order was made against the second 
						defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">An appeal is by way of 
						re-hearing, see Order 8 rule (1) of the Court of Appeal 
						Rules, 1997, C.I. 19. What this means is that &#8220;the 
						appeal is not limited to a consideration whether a 
						misdirection or a misperception of evidence or other 
						alleged defect in the trial has taken place in the 
						trial, so that a new trial should be ordered. They 
						indicate that the court is not even limited to 
						consideration of the points raised in the notice of 
						appeal but will consider the whole of the evidence given 
						in the court below and the whole course of the trial. On 
						these Orders 31 and 32 of the Court of Appeal Rules, 
						C.I. 19, are loud and clear, as the general powers of 
						this Court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A study of the evidence 
						as a whole reveals that the judge did not fail to 
						discharge his duty of making primary findings of facts. 
						I find no fault with what he did. Where the evidence 
						supports the judge, such as in this case, an appellant 
						court would be hard put to reverse his findings. His 
						judgment should find favour with the appellant court. 
						None of the grounds of appeal impresses this court and 
						they are rather dismissed as lacking any merit. The 
						judgment of the court below is affirmed and the appeal 
						dismissed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Everybody is entitled 
						to have an easy and unimpeded access to his property and 
						where the right is violated the person has a right to 
						seek a remedy in a court of law. The plaintiffs action 
						is in the right direction and ought to succeed on the 
						facts as it did in the Court below.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have an observation 
						or two to make by way of concluding remarks. For far too 
						long the planning schemes of and for many of our cities 
						and towns are flouted with impunity. Many developers put 
						up houses at places where they should not be; in the 
						process, access roads are closed, green belts disappear, 
						and the environment loses its greenery and beauty. 
						Gutters are choked impeding the free flow of water, 
						causing floods at the slightest rainfall. It was high 
						time the planning schemes for our towns and cities were 
						strictly complied with in the larger interest of town 
						and country planning. This is a call on the powers that 
						be to strictly enforce their building regulations and to 
						be ready to abate every nuisance in town. I believe this 
						will not fall on deaf ears.</span></p>
