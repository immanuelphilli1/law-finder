						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">MRS. WOOD, J.A.:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Anona family of the 
						Awutu Traditional area, in the Central region of Ghana, 
						are the owners of a 600 acre tract of land at Obrayeho 
						and Amodua .</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In about 1975, the 
						respondent company, upon an agreement reached with the 
						family, redeemed the said land from customary pledges 
						and then succeeded in obtaining a lease of the subject 
						matter upon terms which became the subject of much 
						heated controversy at the trial. Ten years after the 
						execution of the lease agreement, the appellant forcibly 
						entered the land, thus compelling the respondent to sue 
						for general and special damages, and orders for recovery 
						of possession and perpetual injunction. While the 
						respondent contended that the lease was for a term of 70 
						years at an annual rent of ¢ 1.00 (one cedi) per acre, 
						with an option for a further term of 25 years, the 
						appellant who was sued in his capacity as head of the 
						Family, had on the other hand maintained it was for 10 
						years certain only.&nbsp; He therefore&nbsp; vehemently challenged 
						the validity of the agreement on two main grounds.&nbsp; 
						Firstly, on the ground that the deed on which the 
						respondent relies was obtained by fraud and secondly, 
						that the agreement was unconscionable. The fraud was 
						particularised and also in terms which if put together 
						with other pleaded facts, clearly show that the 
						appellant is seeking redress under the Conveyancing 
						Decree NRCD 54, the S. 18 to be specific.&nbsp; So that, 
						while we may not find an express or specific plea that 
						the conveyance be set aside, under that statute, the 
						substance of the defence clearly discloses a challenge 
						to the agreement on the grounds of unconscionability.&nbsp; 
						Not surprisingly, they put in a counterclaim for:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1)&nbsp; A declaration that 
						the said lease &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; is not binding upon the defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2)&nbsp; Alternatively, a 
						rescission of the said lease. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned trial judge 
						dismissed the counterclaim, granted relief to the 
						respondent on all his claims, but then at the same time, 
						describing the court as a &#8220;Court of Conscience &#8230;&#8230; and 
						&#8230;&#8230;. Court of Equity&#8221; ordered &#8220;a speedy renegotiation by 
						the parties of the recoverable rent under the guidance 
						of an umpire who shall be the Registrar of the Court.&#8221;&nbsp; 
						They were further ordered to report back to the court.&nbsp; 
						These orders were made in spite of the court's own clear 
						and unambiguous finding that the agreement was not 
						unconscionable.&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Dissatisfied, the 
						appellant has appealed on four grounds of appeal 
						namely:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a)&nbsp; The learned trial 
						judge did not consider sufficiently or at all the 
						evidence of the defendant that he understood the lease 
						to be for 10 years and that he had since 1984 tried to 
						rescind the lease or get the plaintiff to agree on a 
						revision of the rent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b)&nbsp; The learned trial 
						judge over relied on the evidence of witnesses who had 
						direct interests in the success of the plaintiff&#8217;s case 
						as against that of the defendant&#8217;s.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c)&nbsp; The learned trial 
						judge failed to do equity in the circumstances of the 
						case. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d)&nbsp; Damages of ¢8 
						million Cedis awarded to the plaintiff in the 
						circumstances is excessive and wrong in law.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The allegation of fraud 
						as pleaded by the appellant was that: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Paragraph 4., &#8220;(i) The 
						oral agreement was not a lease for 70 years but 10 
						years.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(ii)&nbsp; The oral 
						agreement did not certain a renewal for a further 25 
						years term.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(iii) Failing to read 
						the entire document to the defendant by concealing from 
						defendant the 70 plus 25 years term inserted in the 
						lease.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Defendant says that the 
						¢ 1.00 per acre was arrived at after the payment and not 
						before and it was fraudulent, unfair and unconscionable 
						for the plaintiff to have used the rate of ¢1.00 per 
						acre for the whole 70 years and 25 years term which he 
						unilaterally inserted in the lease&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Undoubtedly, the 
						respondent led evidence in support of his claim that the 
						agreement was for 70 years with an option for a renewal 
						for a further term of 25 years.&nbsp; He did not only 
						tendered the lease agreement as Exhibit A but called two 
						other persons PW1, and PW2 who are a nephew and cousin 
						respectively to the appellant to support his claim.
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">With the evidential 
						burden shifting on to the appellant, he deposed that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The family first met 
						and agreed to grant their request for land to farm 
						on&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&nbsp; The plaintiff's representative and the family 
						entered into an arrangement for the representative to 
						redeem the pledge with Okwablah Adu &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; After the 
						redemption, we agreed with the plaintiff's 
						representative to have a grant of the land for a period 
						of 10 years&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; The representative of the plaintiff 
						prepared a document on the grant and we executed or 
						signed it.&nbsp; Before the thumb printing, the document was 
						read to us.&nbsp; One Olaga, the lawyer who prepared the 
						document read it to us.&nbsp; He read to us in Twi.&nbsp; I 
						understood him to have explained that the land would be 
						redeemed after 10 years.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Are the criticisms 
						levelled against the trial judge by the grounds (1) and 
						(2) justified?&nbsp; In other words, did he fail to consider 
						sufficiently or at all the appellant's defence, namely 
						that the agreement was for 10 years and further that 
						since 1984 he had tried unsuccessfully to have the 
						agreement rescinded or the rent raised? Secondly, did he 
						overly place undue weight on the evidence of the 
						respondent&#8217;s witnesses?&nbsp; My answer to both questions 
						would be in the negative.&nbsp; The trial judge painstakingly 
						reviewed the respective claims set up by each party, the 
						evidence in proof or disproof of the facts pleaded on 
						either side of this legal divide, as well as the 
						argument of their respective counsels in a manner that 
						ought to have attracted very little criticism.&nbsp; </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Indeed, I would in a 
						direct answer to the charge that he failed to adequately 
						consider the appellant's case on the period of the 
						lease, say that he did.&nbsp; He appreciated the task facing 
						him and gave valid reasons for preferring the 
						respondent&#8217;s case to the appellant's. These findings are 
						amply supported by the record and this court would not 
						be justified in interfering with them.&nbsp; The well settled 
						rule of&nbsp; law which have been expanded in such cases as 
						Yakubu II v Abadulai 1984-1986 GLR 241 is that an 
						appellate court would disturb a finding of fact only 
						where there was no evidence in support or that the 
						preponderance of evidence weighs against that finding, 
						or wrong inferences were drawn from those findings.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">To justify the position 
						that I have taken, I would reproduce the relevant 
						portions of the judgment which dealt with the issue of 
						the period of the lease.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;There is also 
						uncontroverted evidence on record to show that at a 
						meeting in the house one Nana Tiah (now deceased), then 
						an ex-chief of Awutu and an accredited member of the 
						aforesaid family assembled agreed to lease the land to 
						the company for a term of years. At that point, the 
						agreement was oral. Now the question whether by that 
						oral agreement the company was given to hold the demised 
						land for only 10 years, according to the defendant's 
						oath or for 70 years with the option for renew for 
						another 25, as the company's representative swore seems 
						to be the most crucial problem herein.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendant made a 
						bare assertion on oath that his family agreed to grant 
						and did grant the company a lease of land at both 
						Obrayoho and Amodua for 10 years.&nbsp; He said he heard the 
						person who read the lease instrument (Exh A) at the time 
						of the execution thereof, to have said that the lease 
						was to last for 10 years.&nbsp; His terse evidence received 
						no corroboration whatsoever.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The evidence led on 
						behalf of the company, on the other hand, was amply 
						supported.&nbsp; Kojo Afedu, PW1 and a principal member of 
						the defendant's family swore that he was present when 
						the deed of the lease Exh A was executed and it was read 
						and made clear to the gathering that it was for a term 
						of 70 years &#8230;&#8230;. Similarly Emmanuel Kobina Tetteh also 
						known as Kobina Mohahay, a member of the Anona family&#8230;&#8230;. 
						And PW3 confirmed on oath that Exh A was read, 
						translated into and explained in Ga to parties herein 
						and members of the defendant's family who had gone as 
						supporters of the defendant and witnesses to the 
						transaction.&nbsp; So that the term of years (70 years 
						certain, to be specific) as contained in the instrument, 
						it is submitted, could not have been lost on anyone 
						person present.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The evidence preferred 
						by the company&#8217;s representative, above all is neatly 
						consistent with the term of years set out in the 
						habendum of the lease (instrument) It reads &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the parcels clause, 
						&#8220;the same&#8221; that the lessees were granted to hold was 
						described with reference to the schedules of the 
						instrument providing further and better particulars of 
						the land. It is my view, significant that the defendant 
						has affirmed that exhibit A was read to all including 
						himself and the terms of years did register with his 
						hearing faculty as 10 years certain rather than 70 
						years, contained in the document&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the circumstances of 
						the foregoing, it is fair and reasonable in my judgment 
						to say that the term of years agreed upon by the parties 
						prior to the drawing up and the execution of the Exh. A 
						could not be other than 70 with the option to renew for 
						a further term of 25 years.&#8221; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Additionally, the 
						learned trial judge proceeded to consider thoroughly 
						well another defence which was akin to the appellant's 
						claim that he understood the term to be for 10 years 
						only.&#8212;the plea of the non est factum.&nbsp; The argument on

						<span style="font-family: Arial">Yet again, the trial

						the letter or other document as shown by the attestation 
						clause, Exh A was duly read over, interpreted and 
						explained in his language by one Bodyea to the defendant 
						representing Anona family, &#8220;when he appeared to 
						understand the same before his mark was made in the 
						presence of four witnesses all members of the said 
						family.&nbsp; PW3 corroborated the evidence led by the 
						company&#8217;s representative on this issue.&nbsp; Both were aware 
						that the document was read over, interpreted and 
						explained to him.&nbsp; He did not complain of having 
						suffered any disability with regard to understanding the 
						language employed.&nbsp; He did not tell the court that he 
						endured a disadvantage by reason of the language &#8211; Ga or 
						Twi- used.&nbsp; The reasonable presumption is that he 
						understood the language used and fully appreciated the 
						meaning and effect of the lease&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The relatively recent 
						decision of Zambrama v Segbedzi 1991 2 GLR 221 affirmed 
						the well known rule that the onus of proving that an 
						illiterate party has appreciated the meaning and effect 
						of a document lay on the party seeking to bind the 
						illiterate to it.&nbsp; This court, unanimously speaking 
						through Kpegah JA, as he then was, affirmed the legal 
						position as such: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The principle was 
						firmly established by a stream of decided cases that 
						where an illiterate executed a document which 
						compromised his interest and that document was being 
						used against him by a party to it or his privy, there 
						was no presumption in favour of the proponent of the 
						document and against the illiterate person, that the 
						latter appreciated and had an intelligent knowledge of 
						the contents of the document.&nbsp; The party seeking to rely 
						on the document must lead evidence in proof that the 
						document was actually read and interpreted to the 
						illiterate who understood it before signing the same&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Being a question the 
						presence of or otherwise of an interpretation clause on 
						a document was one of the factors a court should take 
						into account in determining whether the document in 
						question was fully understood by the illiterate.&nbsp; It was 
						still possible for an illiterate to lead evidence 
						outside the document to show that despite the said Jurat, 
						he was not fully made aware of the contents of the 
						document to which he made his mark.&nbsp; If a court, after 
						assessing all the available evidence was satisfied, upon 
						the preponderance of the evidence that the document was 
						read and interpreted to the illiterate person then the 
						burden of proof would have been discharged by the person 
						relying on the document.&#8221;&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The clear evidence is 
						that the respondent discharged the initial burden which 
						lay on him in proof of the necessary criteria spelt out 
						in the Zambrama case.&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Apart from his own 
						detailed evidence, there is the testimony of the PW3, a 
						member of the family and whose father during that 
						crucial period, was the chief linguist of the family and 
						even more importantly, who executed the deed as a 
						witness.&nbsp; He testified. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;I have an indenture in 
						hand.&nbsp; It is Exh A. This document was prepared by a 
						lawyer at Adabraka in Accra.&nbsp; It was prepared in a 
						lawyer&#8217;s office, the document was then read to them. The 
						lawyer&#8217;s secretary read in English and interpreted or 
						explained in Ga language. The elders executed by signing 
						or thumbprinting (by them) according as they could read 
						and write or not.&nbsp; The defendant&nbsp; thumbprinted the 
						document. The defendant's witnesses included Okyeame 
						Kofi Heharkay, Abusuapanyin Kwabena Arhin, Tafohene&nbsp; 
						Kwaku Adewu and E. N. K. Tetteh.&nbsp; E. N. K Tetteh is my 
						humble self.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The uncorroborated 
						evidence of the appellant is obviously not sufficiently 
						strong enough to displace the credible evidence supplied 
						by his opponent, and hence my contention that the 
						criticism against the findings are untenable.&nbsp; </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The least said about 
						the arguments advanced in support of the ground (2) the 
						better.&nbsp; These were that contrary to the evidence, the 
						trial judge described the PW1 and PW3,</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a)&nbsp; as credible 
						witnesses.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b)&nbsp; Well recognised 
						members of the Anona family and</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c)&nbsp; He erroneously in 
						law, described their evidence as constituting a 
						declaration against interest.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;The finding that the 
						two are well-recognised members of the family is amply 
						supported by the record.&nbsp; The unchallenged evidence of 
						the PW1 is that at the date of giving evidence, he was 
						the Gyasehene of the family.&nbsp; And at the date of the 
						execution of the exhibit A, he was one of the principal 
						members of the family.&nbsp; Also his predecessor was one of 
						those who represented the family in the negotiations for 
						the lease. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The PW3 who described 
						the appellant as his father's nephew was one of the 
						witnesses to the lease agreement. At the time, his 
						father was the chief linguist.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He attended family 
						meetings at which the transaction took place and 
						customary rites performed. What better description than 
						that these gentleman are well recognised members of the 
						family.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Given that they are 
						members of the family, with clear proprietary rights or 
						interests in the subject matter, one can understand that 
						contextually, the judge was right in describing their 
						evidence as constituting a declaration against 
						interest.&nbsp; Each had given evidence in support of the 
						respondent's claim that the lease period was 70 years 
						and not 10 years.&nbsp; Counsel&#8217;s contention however is that 
						because they have acquired tenancies from the 
						respondent, they are agents with direct and vested 
						interest in the case and consequently their interests 
						run counter to that of the family, and for that matter 
						cannot, in all honesty, described as credible witnesses.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">While the PW3 can 
						properly be described as a relation and an agent of the 
						respondent, the same cannot be said of the PW1. In any 
						case the rule established in Nkaeguo v Kunadu (1974) 2 
						GLR 150 is that court is not entitled to reject evidence 
						simply because it came from a relation.&nbsp; Afadi v 
						Ladzenpo 1981 GLR 48 CA reinforced the point that:
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Whilst there is need 
						for caution in accepting the corroborative evidence of a 
						relation, especially when his evidence was being offered 
						against a stranger to the family, it is not justifiable 
						to reject the same without laying a foundation for such 
						a course&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The PW3&#8217;s interest cut 
						across both ways, that is to say while he is related to 
						the respondent by marriage and has been given farming 
						rights, it is equally true he is a member of the Anona 
						family.&nbsp; This puts him in the unique position of being 
						also a &#8220;part owner&#8221; of the subject matter.&nbsp; Looked at 
						from that angle his interest in the family&#8217;s success and 
						so allegiance to the family must be stronger than that 
						owed to the respondent. In this instant case, where the 
						decision depended on the credibility of the witnesses, I 
						cannot interfere with the findings of fact&nbsp; &#8220;except 
						where they were shown to be wrong or where the facts 
						were wrong inferences drawn from admitted facts or facts 
						found by the trial court&#8221;.&nbsp; See Praka v Ketewa 1964 GLR 
						423 at 426. The only logical conclusion is that the 
						appeal based on these grounds must necessarily fail.&nbsp;
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">But then, there is yet 
						a third and crucial ground by which it was contended 
						that the trial judge failed to do equity in the 
						circumstances of this case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Respondent counsel&#8217;s 
						argument that this criticism is unfair because the trial 
						judge had ordered a renegotiation of the rent, is no 
						answer for there is a legal incongruity here. Having 
						found that the bargain was consciounable, that the 
						counterclaim fails in its entirety, and further that the 
						respondent was entitled to all the reliefs, that order 
						for renegotiation cannot be validated.&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">However, looking at the 
						arguments advanced in support of this ground of appeal, 
						as well as the pleadings, my understanding of the 
						complaint or may I put it this way, the substance of the 
						complaint is that, the finding that the agreement is not 
						unconscionable is clearly wrong and ought to be 
						reversed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">That the appellant 
						sought for a setting aside of the agreement on the 
						grounds of unconscionability is beyond question. He 
						counterclaimed for three reliefs.&nbsp; Included in them is 
						such further or other reliefs as is just.&nbsp; Paragraphs 4 
						(vi), 4(vii) and 12 contain facts on which the 
						unconscionability plea is based.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">That our courts have 
						power under orders. 18 of NRCD 175 to grant equitable 
						reliefs by setting aside or nullifying unconscionable 
						agreements to convey an interest in land is also not in 
						doubt.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The unreported Supreme 
						Court case of Anna Badu Cofie v Shahin Elias Shahin and 
						4 ors Civil appeal 4/9 17th January 1995 spells out what 
						an unconscionable agreement is and the factors a court 
						must take into account in arriving at that conclusion.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Speaking unanimously 
						through Amuah Sekyi JSC, the court said:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;By section 18, the 
						court may set aside or modify an agreement to convey or 
						a conveyance of an interest in land on the ground of 
						unconscionability.&nbsp; Where after considering all the 
						circumstances, it is satisfied that the transaction is 
						unconscionable. Among the circumstances, the court is 
						required to take into account are the bargaining conduct 
						of the parties, their relative bargaining positions, the 
						value to each party of the agreement reached and 
						evidence as to the commercial setting, purpose and 
						effect of their agreement.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">An unconscionable 
						bargain or agreement is one which an independent 
						observer would regard as unreasonable; that is, one 
						which no man who had regard to his own interests would 
						make and no &#8211; fair minded person would accept.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I think this agreement 
						fall into that category of case.&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The uncontroverted 
						evidence shows that the respondent company was 
						represented at the negotiations by a Mr. Braun, a 
						whiteman and the managing director of the company, a 
						chartered accountant. With due deference to our people, 
						it is common knowledge that our local people, 
						particularly in rural Ghana, hold whitemen in great awe 
						and esteem some see them as demi-gods and would do 
						everything lying in their power to please them. </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The respondent denied 
						the appellant's, assertion that they promised to build a 
						dam. I am inclined to believe the appellant.&nbsp; The river 
						Atwere runs through that 600 acre land.&nbsp; The respondent 
						took its name from company was named after that river. I 
						can very well imagine, as obtains in the normal course 
						of life in most transactions, marriages and other love 
						relationships included, the respondent making the finest 
						of promises to these poor and comparatively ignorant and 
						illiterate farmers who were from the evidence, desperate 
						to redeem their vast tract of land from a pledge, but 
						yet did not have the wherewithal. On their bargaining 
						positions then, the respondent was not on equal footing 
						with the appellant.&nbsp; Indeed that there was a serious 
						power imbalance cannot be denied.&nbsp; The uneducated 
						appellant was in a much weaker position than the 
						whiteman and the literate, highly qualified managing 
						director who admitted under cross examination that &#8220;with 
						my background as a chartered accountant, I fully 
						appreciated the nature of the transaction with the 
						defendant.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellant was not 
						given a copy of the draft lease agreement to enable him 
						seek independent legal advice in respect of such an 
						important transaction, whose terms contrary to 
						expectations excluded a revision clause in respect of 
						the rent. Given that the lease period was far as much as 
						70 years and the rent fixed at ¢ 1.00, can it honestly 
						be said this is an agreement any independent observer 
						would regard as reasonable or one which any man having 
						regard to his own interest would accept? I think not.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A look at the covenants 
						would lead to the undeniable conclusion that the 
						agreement was in reality of little or no benefit to the 
						appellant. Although, the obviously false impression was 
						created that there were several covenants and conditions 
						contained in the lease to be performed by the lessee, 
						the truth is that is absolutely false, there being only 
						four simple covenants, these categorized as usual 
						covenants and conditions, usually binding on ordinary 
						tenants i.e covenant to pay rent, rates and taxes, to 
						deliver possession at the determination of the term and 
						to keep in good tenantable condition, buildings which 
						may be erected on the land.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the contrary, 
						therefore, there are no express special covenants or 
						conditions in respect of this lease obtained for special 
						use&#8212;agricultural and commercial purpose, for 70 long 
						years&#8212;almost two generations.&nbsp; Given the rather low rent 
						of ¢ 1 per acre, and the fact that subsequently, the 
						respondent started subletting portions of it, without 
						the express consent of the appellant, it becomes 
						immediately clear that relative benefit of the agreement 
						to the appellant is negligible.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Finally, considering 
						also the manner in which from the unchallenged evidence 
						of the defendant, the execution of the agreement was 
						rushed through (the execution took place in an 
						uncompleted building and while they stood)&nbsp; I am 
						inclined to hold from all the circumstances of this case 
						that this was an unconscionable bargain.&nbsp; The respondent 
						have enjoyed the property for some ten years. There is 
						no evidence that apart from the initial outlay, they 
						have incurred further expenditures in the land. I would 
						therefore set this lease aside.&nbsp; They are however, at 
						liberty to renegotiate the lease with the appellant. In 
						the result, the appeal would be allowed and both the 
						decision and the costs awarded in the court below would 
						be set aside.</span></p>
