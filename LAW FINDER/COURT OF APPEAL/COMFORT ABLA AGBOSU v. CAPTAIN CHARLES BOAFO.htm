						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is an appeal from 
						the decision of the High Court, Koforidua entered in 
						favour of the plaintiff, who sued for herself and on 
						behalf of her children who she had by the late Seth 
						Kwabla Agbosu of Battor&#8211;Aveyime.&nbsp; The defendant is a 
						retired officer of the Ghana Army.&nbsp; The dispute is over 
						a piece of land with building thereon situate at 
						Gbejirmanya - Somanya. There is no dispute about the 
						identity of the property in question.&nbsp; The plaintiff 
						sued for declaration of title, recovery of possession, 
						damages for trespass and perpetual injunction against 
						the defendant. Her grounds for these claims were pleaded 
						in a statement of claim in which she averred that she 
						was joint purchaser of the land with her late husband S. 
						K. Agbosu (hereinafter referred to as the deceased). 
						That it was she and her children, with the consent of 
						the deceased, who put up a six room house on the land. 
						That against their protest (that is plaintiff and her 
						children), the deceased sold the property to the 
						defendant.&nbsp; The deceased sued the children over this 
						property at the High Court but later discontinued same.&nbsp; 
						The defendant has since January, 1985 entered the land 
						to exercise acts of ownership.&nbsp; Hence this action.&nbsp; For 
						his part, the defendant averred that he bought this 
						property from the deceased after he had caused proper 
						search to be made at the Lands Registry, Koforidua which 
						search disclosed the deceased to be owner thereof free 
						from any encumbrance.&nbsp; That he paid the purchase price 
						and had documents duly registered in his name.&nbsp; That it 
						was only after the purchase was completed that the 
						plaintiff and her children protested and they entered 
						the land to harvest food crops there.&nbsp; He denied 
						knowledge of the litigation between the deceased and his 
						children over this property.&nbsp; He averred that as a 
						wealthy man, deceased would not buy land with money 
						provided by the plaintiff.&nbsp; That he had acquired a legal 
						title to the property and plaintiffs were estopped from 
						denying that.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In her reply plaintiff 
						averred that the documents on the property bore the name 
						of the deceased alone, but explained this was done 
						purely out of convenience.&nbsp; That after the sale the 
						deceased was confronted and he apologised for his acts 
						and offered to pay for the land and building but she 
						rejected the offer and insisted on her right.&nbsp; That the 
						deceased lost his wealth and was dependent to a large 
						extent on the plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The issues agreed upon 
						for hearing were:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1) Whether or not the 
						defendant purchased the land in dispute with knowledge 
						of plaintiff&#8217;s interest in the said property.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) Whether or not the 
						plaintiff owned the property jointly with her late 
						husband.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(3)&nbsp; Whether or not the 
						defendant has acquired any legal title and interest in 
						this land.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Evidence was led by and 
						for both parties and at the end of the day the trial 
						court resolved all the issues in favour of the 
						plaintiff.&nbsp; The court's reasons will be unfolded as we 
						go on to discuss the various grounds of appeal which 
						are:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1)&nbsp; Since evidence on 
						record shows the late Seth Agbosu was a wealthy 
						goldsmith and since at the peak of his wealth he 
						purchased the property in dispute in his own name and 
						since during his lifetime he filed a claim to the effect 
						that he was the sole owner of the property and since the 
						plaintiff could not lead any concrete evidence to rebut 
						that, the learned trial Judge misdirected herself and 
						erred when she held that the late Seth Agbosu bought the 
						property jointly with the plaintiff as a normal practice 
						between husband and wife who are illiterates.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) Since the claim of 
						the plaintiff was for a declaration of joint title and 
						ownership and since the plaintiff did not discharge the 
						onus required by law on her the learned trial judge 
						erred in giving judgment in her favour.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(3) Since the plaintiff 
						instituted the action for and on her own behalf and on 
						behalf of her children and since plaintiff&#8217;s children 
						could be properly described as parties and gave evidence 
						as witnesses the learned trial Judge erred in relying 
						mostly on the evidence of plaintiff&#8217;s children who are 
						interested parties in the matter to establish the claim 
						of the plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(4)&nbsp; In view of the 
						fact that the claim of the plaintiff was for joint 
						ownership and in view of the fact that even if plaintiff 
						has succeeded in establishing her claim she would have 
						been entitled to only a portion of the property, the 
						learned trial Judge misdirected herself and in the 
						process occasioned a grave miscarriage of justice when 
						she declared the sale agreement between the late Seth 
						Agbosu and the defendant as null and void.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(5) Since the defendant 
						bought the property from the late Seth Agbosu who was 
						the owner of the property and since defendant was placed 
						in possession of the property and exercised covert acts 
						of ownership for more than three years before plaintiff 
						instituted the present action the learned trial Judge 
						erred in holding that the defendant's act of possession 
						amounted to trespass in law.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(6) The learned trial 
						Judge misdirected herself in holding that Exhibits 1, 5 
						and 6 tendered in support of the search were dubious.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel for the 
						defendant/appellant argued grounds 1, 2 and 3 together.&nbsp; 
						Counsel submitted that since plaintiff claimed 
						declaration of title &#8220;the legal burden of proof on her 
						is one of proof beyond reasonable doubt&#8221;.&nbsp; He cited in 
						support a dictum of Francois J.S.C. in the case of Banga 
						vrs. Djanie (1989 &#8211; 90) 1 G.L.R. 510 at p. 519.&nbsp; This 
						submission appears to contradict all the known 
						authorities and even legislation, per sections 11, 12 
						and 13 of the Evidence Decree, 1975 (N.R.C.D. 323) which 
						say that proof beyond reasonable doubt is required in 
						criminal or quasi&#8211;criminal matters only and that in 
						civil trials proof on a preponderance of probabilities 
						or balance of probabilities is sufficient.&nbsp; Let us take 
						and analyse what the learned Judge said at pp. 519 &#8211; 520 
						of the report.&nbsp; He said:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Since a declaration of 
						title is sought, it is essential that the usual burden 
						of proof should be satisfactorily discharged for 
						success. That burden was clearly laid in Kodilinye vrs. 
						Odu (1935) 2 WACA 336.&nbsp; That burden which is now trite 
						learning, ensures that the plaintiff should win on the 
						strength of his own case, which must not be propped up 
						by weaknesses in the defendant's case. The principle has 
						for several decades been the fulcrum for determining 
						ownership in land matters in our courts. In recent times 
						a dangerous trend has been erupting of equating this 
						burden with the normal burden in a civil case of 
						measuring success by a balance of probabilities.&nbsp; In my 
						view the requirement of a higher burden of proof in land 
						matters cannot be whittled away by glosses on the 
						principle. This quality of proof has sometimes even been 
						equated with proof in criminal matters, i.e. proof 
						beyond reasonable doubt&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In so far as the 
						learned Judge equated proof in land matters with that in 
						criminal matters, I think, with respect, that he erred 
						especially in the light of the clear provisions of the 
						Evidence Decree (cited above) which would overrule any 
						previous decisions to the effect as stated by the 
						learned Judge. Fortunately the other two justices who 
						sat on that appeal did not go to this extent. Be that as 
						it may, the Supreme Court has finally decided against 
						this reasoning of requiring proof beyond reasonable 
						doubt in land claims, see Adwubeng vrs. Domfeh (1996-97) 
						SC G.L.R. 660, holding 3 and also at p. 670 per Acquah 
						J.S.C. Thus the standard of proof required in land 
						claims is one of a preponderance or balance of 
						probabilities.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Let us return to the 
						submissions.&nbsp; Counsel for the appellant said the 
						plaintiff and her witnesses abandoned the claim for a 
						declaration of title in favour of that of joint 
						ownership&quot;. That I think is wrong for, by the statement 
						of claim the plaintiff averred that she jointly 
						purchased the plot with her children, hence the relief 
						sought being declaration of title.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel continued:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;section 35 of the 
						Evidence Decree, 1975 (N.R.C.D. 323) states that: (The 
						owner of the legal title to property is presumed to be 
						the owner of the full beneficial title). So that by law 
						once the title deeds are in the name of Seth Komla 
						Agbosu, he is presumed to be the full beneficial owner 
						with power to dispose of his self acquired property as 
						and when he thought fit. This presumption can be 
						rebutted by concrete and uncontroverted evidence that 
						the beneficial title is vested in someone else or 
						jointly with another&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is a perfect 
						proposition of law.&nbsp; Then counsel went on to review the 
						evidence and concluded that the plaintiff did not 
						establish her case.&nbsp; Counsel referred to the plaintiff&#8217;s 
						evidence - in - chief that she and the deceased jointly 
						purchased the land.&nbsp; That under cross- examination the 
						plaintiff &quot;traced her claim to joint ownership by reason 
						of her marriage to the late Seth K Agbosu&quot;.&nbsp; Counsel's 
						conclusion was based on the following extract from the 
						cross-examination of the plaintiff:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Q - You will agree 
						with me that no receipt was issued in your joint name.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A - Yes, but it was by 
						consent that it was issued that way.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q - I&nbsp; am putting it to 
						you that the receipt was not issued in your husband's 
						name by consent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A - My husband married 
						me according to custom so everything that is my 
						husband's is mine.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q - It is because you 
						say everything that is your husband's is yours that is 
						why you are claiming the land in dispute.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A - Yes, we purchased 
						the property jointly and I am his wedded wife.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">With all respect to 
						learned counsel I do not think the plaintiff was 
						claiming ownership of this property of virtue of her 
						marriage to the deceased; even the last answer which 
						appears to suggest that fact was very clear that she 
						acquired the property jointly with the husband. The 
						proper inference to be drawn was that as a married 
						couple they did things in common and having bought this 
						property jointly it was meant for their common good. At 
						any rate against the background to the dispute and 
						considering the totality of her case, the plaintiff 
						never claimed this property by virtue of her marriage.&nbsp; 
						As decided by the Supreme Court in Khoury vrs. Choitel 
						(1964) GLR 100 it was important that the totality of a 
						person's testimony be considered in deciding on an 
						issue.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel went further to 
						say that the plaintiff changed her story again, this 
						time, to that of a gift. This also counsel picked from 
						the cross-examination of the plaintiff, and it reads:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Q - Did you say in 
						your evidence that your husband gave you a gift of part 
						of his land for you to build on?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A -&nbsp; Yes, that was when 
						I wanted to build and he said he was not going to build 
						at Somanya</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q -&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not true 
						your husband made a gift of part of the land to you.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is true</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q -&nbsp;&nbsp; If you were a 
						joint owner of the land you will not require a gift from 
						co-owner</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A -&nbsp;&nbsp; He did not gift 
						the land to me he only blessed it for me.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q -&nbsp;&nbsp; Your husband did 
						not bless anything for you.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He did.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">To begin with, the fact 
						of a gift was not pleaded so no evidence on it should 
						have been allowed either in the evidence in chief or 
						under cross-examination being totally inadmissible 
						evidence. And in such a situation the trial court should 
						reject it when giving judgment or if it does not do so 
						the appellate court should, see Tormekpey vrs. Ahiable 
						(1975) 2 G.L.R 432 C.A. But in this case the evidence of 
						a gift or blessing or by whatever name called was 
						proffered to show that before the plaintiff and her 
						children built on the land the deceased was informed 
						about it and it was with his consent and blessing that 
						the building was put up. This is in accord with 
						paragraph 6 of her statement of claim whereby she 
						averred that &#8220;plaintiff and her children with the 
						consent of the husband put up a six room building (not 
						roofed) on the said plot &#8230;..&#8221; (Emphasis mine).&nbsp; Hence 
						the evidence that the deceased gifted part the land and 
						took a bottle of schnapps from her, a fact confirmed by 
						the mason (PW1).&nbsp; Let me recall the relevant evidence at 
						this stage.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">PW1 Michael Dawutey 
						said the plaintiff approached him and his wife to 
						prevail upon the deceased to build for her and her 
						children at Somanya.&nbsp; But when he put this request 
						before the deceased he refused saying he would prefer 
						building in his own hometown.&nbsp; After some persistent 
						efforts by PW1 at persuading the deceased, the latter 
						decided to give her part of the plot they bought.&nbsp; He 
						continued:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;He released the plot 
						to her and the plaintiff gave him a bottle of schnapps 
						in my presence for the land.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff said she 
						approached PW1 to appeal to the deceased to build for 
						her which he refused to do.&nbsp; She continued:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;My husband finally 
						agreed I should put up a building on the plot. He 
						collected a bottle of schnapps from me in the presence 
						of PW1 before he showed me where to build&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was this act which 
						plaintiff described in various ways as a gift or a 
						blessing.&nbsp; By whatever account it was not a gift perse.&nbsp; 
						The scenario was that she had contributed to the 
						acquisition of the land which was then conveyed in the 
						name of the husband who she truly described as the head 
						of family.&nbsp; As a loyal and respectful wife, she would 
						not do anything on the land without the husband&#8217;s 
						knowledge and consent.&nbsp; More particularly as she needed 
						a building for herself and her own children (to the 
						exclusion of the deceased&#8217;s other wives, if any, and 
						children), she needed a firm commitment from the 
						deceased that he had released the land to her and her 
						children to build on.&nbsp; In fact this act was very 
						symbolic both in fact and in law.&nbsp; In terms of fact the 
						deceased&#8217;s consent (as pleaded) in allowing the 
						plaintiff and the children to build on the land would 
						mean that he had given them unconditional access to, and 
						user of, the land to the exclusion of any of his other 
						children.&nbsp; In law it has been held in several cases some 
						of which were cited by counsel for the appellant namely 
						Odoteye vrs. Odoteye (1984 &#8211; 86) 1 G.L.R. 519: Quartey 
						vrs. Martey (1959) G.L.R. 377: Gyamerah vrs. Buor (1962) 
						1 GLR 196 that assistance offered by wife and children 
						to their husband and father does not entitle them to a 
						part ownership of the property he acquires.&nbsp; So that if 
						it is said that, even the money contributed by the 
						plaintiff did not entitle her to a share of the land, 
						then the fact that the deceased took schnapps (a very 
						significant customary drink) before allowing her and her 
						children to build on the land would mean he had 
						recognised the woman&#8217;s contribution as, at least, an 
						owner in her own right.&nbsp; And that is the only conclusion 
						one could reach in view of the understanding reached 
						before the schnapps was demanded and paid.&nbsp; In my view 
						this evidence was not contradictory to the plaintiff&#8217;s 
						position of a joint acquirer of the plot, it was an act 
						by which effectively the deceased acknowledged 
						plaintiff&#8217;s title and which effectively released the 
						land to the plaintiff and her children.&nbsp; The wrong use 
						of the word &quot;gift&quot; should not detract from the substance 
						and significance of what took place in order not to 
						defeat the purpose of taking the drink from the 
						plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Next, counsel referred 
						to the evidence of Ben Agbosu (PW4), Paul Agbosu (PW7), 
						J. Narh Kwesi (PW2) all of who are related to the 
						plaintiff by blood, and said their evidence should not 
						be relied upon.&nbsp; His first reason is that as blood 
						relations they are interested persons. He relied on this 
						dictum by Osei-Hwere J. (as he then was) in the case of 
						Adai vrs. Anane (1973) 1 G.L.R. 144 at pp. 149-150;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;A plaintiff in an 
						action for a declaration of title assumed the heavy 
						burden of proof and he does not discharge that onus by 
						merely calling his relations to support his evidence. To 
						do so would invite the failure of his claim. This is 
						exactly what the plaintiff did. All his witnesses, the 
						first and second hailed from a common grandfather with 
						him&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A similar reasoning by 
						Twumasi J. (as he then was) was also referred to in the 
						case of Nkrumah vrs. Foli and Another (1982 - 83) 2 
						G.L.R. 1046.&nbsp; Counsel said</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;regrettably the 
						learned trial Judge relied heavily on the evidence of 
						these interested parties to reach the conclusion that 
						she arrived at&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I do not consider these 
						decisions to be expressing the rigid view that a 
						plaintiff cannot</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">succeed if all his 
						witnesses are his relations.&nbsp; If that is the reasoning 
						then I will beg to differ.&nbsp; For by section 58 of the 
						Evidence Decree every person, unless otherwise 
						disqualified; is a competent witness.&nbsp; And section 60 
						only demands that a competent witness should testify 
						from personal knowledge. Indeed these provisions were 
						introduced to provide a clear break with the past where 
						several rules were introduced as to who did or did not 
						qualify as a witness.&nbsp; All that the new rule requires is 
						for the court to decide on what weight and credibility 
						to attach to the testimony of a witness.&nbsp; Thus so long 
						as a person is competent who is speaking from personal 
						knowledge the court is not entitled to reject, 
						disbelieve or ignore his testimony simply on account of 
						his blood or other close relationship to the party on 
						whose behalf he testified.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">And since those High 
						Court decisions cited above are saying that the evidence 
						of the close relations do not corroborate that of the 
						party, it means it should be treated or regarded as one 
						and the same evidence as that given by the party 
						himself.&nbsp; And even in such a scenario the party does not 
						lose a civil case where corroboration is not required by 
						law.&nbsp; Besides, the Court of Appeal has held that the 
						court could act on the evidence of a single witness who 
						happens to be a relation of the party calling him.&nbsp; This 
						was in the case of Atadi vrs. Ladzekpo (1981) G.L.R. 218 
						at pp 226 &#8211; 227 where the court, per Edward Wiredu, J.A. 
						said:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Whilst there is the 
						need for caution in accepting the corroborative evidence 
						of a relation, especially when his evidence is being 
						offered against a stranger to the family, it is not 
						justifiable to reject same without laying a foundation 
						for such a course especially when on the evidence such a 
						witness is the only person known to have personal 
						knowledge of the events at issue&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my view the evidence 
						of a relation of the party is entitled to the same 
						consideration as any other person subject to the court 
						cautioning itself that such a witness may give tainted 
						evidence which goes to weight and credibility. If after 
						this caution the court is still satisfied with his 
						testimony nothing prevents it from relying upon it for 
						whatever purpose, for judicial decisions must be based 
						on intelligence and credit of the witness, not on his 
						relationship with a party.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel continued:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;But assuming the 
						learned trial judge was right in relying on the evidence 
						of these interested parties was their probative value 
						sufficient to discharge the onus required by law on the 
						plaintiff?&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He proceeded with an 
						analysis of the evidence of PW2, PW4 and PW7 and said it 
						was either hearsay or based on what the deceased was 
						said to have told them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He continued:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;What beats our mind is 
						why plaintiff and her children did not institute this 
						action as far back as 1984 when the sale took place but 
						had to wait until after the death of Seth K. Agbosu. The 
						law is well settled on such evidence from witness 
						purporting to emanate from a dead person.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He proceeded with some 
						decided authorities, and submitted:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;............. it was 
						incumbent on the learned trial Judge to have approached 
						the story of PW1, PW2, PW4, PW5 and PW7 with suspicion 
						having regard to the fact that the other actor in this 
						story .............. is dead and cannot therefore give 
						his own version of what took place.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It must first of all be 
						pointed out that not all the witnesses for the plaintiff 
						were related to her. PW1 was only a mason and a friend 
						of the deceased, and had no relationship whatever with 
						the plaintiff. Dickson (PW3) was a nephew of the 
						deceased. Phanuel Agbaklah (PW5) was a cousin of the 
						deceased. Madam Yengwah (PW6) was the wife of the 
						deceased's landlord.&nbsp; All these persons gave evidence 
						which in one way or the other supported the case of the 
						plaintiff.&nbsp; PW3 for instance said the deceased told him 
						he (the deceased), the plaintiff and their children were 
						putting up this building because they were being ejected 
						by their landlord.&nbsp; He said also the deceased told him 
						his son in Accra, Prosper Agbosu, a quantity surveyor, 
						had brought him money to buy iron rods.&nbsp; PW5 said the 
						deceased told him he had acquired this land with his 
						wife and children.&nbsp; That he knew the house was put up by 
						the deceased and the wife with financial contribution by 
						the children, and with the physical assistance of the 
						plaintiff and children.&nbsp; PW6 said the plaintiff objected 
						to the deceased selling the house and rejected an offer 
						from the deceased to give her money to buy flour for her 
						bakery business which offer she rejected and insisted 
						she wanted her house back since she built it with her 
						children.&nbsp; In the face of all these pieces of evidence, 
						coming as it were, from relations of the deceased and 
						strangers to the couple which counsel has conveniently 
						chosen to ignore, the trial court was perfectly entitled 
						to rely on them alongside other evidence in coming to a 
						conclusion.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In respect of the 
						submission that it is a case against a dead man, Counsel 
						referred to the case of (Thomas vrs. The Times Book Co. 
						Ltd.) (1966) 2 All ER 241 at p. 244 where Brett M.R. 
						said:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The law is that when 
						an attempt is made to charge a dead person in a matter, 
						in which if he were alive he might have answered the 
						charge the evidence ought to be looked at with great 
						care; the evidence ought to be thoroughly sifted, and 
						the mind of any judge who hears it ought to be first of 
						all in a state of suspicion; but if in the end the 
						truthfulness of the witnesses is made perfectly clear 
						and apparent and the tribunal which has to act on their 
						evidence believes them, the suggested doctrine becomes 
						absurd.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">That principle is 
						accepted if only because it is just fair that, in a 
						situation where a key actor is dead, the court ought to 
						be circumspect in accepting the evidence made against 
						him. Thus in the case of Morris vrs. Monrovia 1 W.A.C.A. 
						70 citing the case of Re Whitaker (1882) Ch. D. 737 it 
						was held that</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;a person making a 
						claim against the estate of a dead man cannot sustain 
						that claim by her&nbsp; ............ own deposition.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this case aside of 
						the plaintiff, seven other persons testified for the 
						plaintiff. So the principle in these cases is satisfied. 
						Moreover the Judge did consider the testimony as a whole 
						in arriving at her decision. It is to be noted that 
						during his lifetime the deceased sued some of his 
						children at the High Court. Pleadings were filed and the 
						children, in their statement of defense, pleaded the 
						fact that their mother contributed £18 out of the 
						purchase price of £55 for this plot out of her own 
						resources. That though the indenture bore the name of 
						only their father he alone did not own the plot. That it 
						was their mother and they the children, who put up this 
						house. It is clear from those pleadings that the case 
						being set up in this action is not strange or new to the 
						deceased estate; if he were alive the deceased would 
						readily agree that was the position of the plaintiff and 
						her children all along. Hence the question of viewing 
						their evidence with suspicion did not seriously arise, 
						except that the court could not accept the evidence 
						without a critical appraisal thereof in the absence of 
						the deceased. Counsel for the appellant referred to the 
						same pleadings and said by the statement of claim, a 
						copy of which was tendered in evidence, the deceased had 
						declared that he was &quot;the absolute and beneficial owner 
						of the property which he sold to the defendant. If that 
						was the position of Seth K. Agbosu in his lifetime then 
						he could not and did not tell anyone that he owned the 
						property jointly with the plaintiff and his children. 
						The learned trial judge failed to give any consideration 
						to the above law, ignored the exhibits referred and 
						accepted the evidence of the witnesses the probative 
						value of which did not satisfy the requirements of the 
						law.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The said High Court 
						suit between the deceased and her children did not go to 
						trial as it was discontinued. So the averments contained 
						therein, apart from giving an indication what the 
						position of either party was never constituted proof of 
						any issue. Apart from admissions made, all averments 
						contained in pleadings are subject to proof.&nbsp; Thus the 
						fact that the deceased had pleaded owning this property 
						all by himself did not mean he never told anybody he 
						owned it jointly with the plaintiff and her children, 
						it's a perfect non sequitur. Parties plead facts which 
						often times turn up to be totally false.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel referred to the 
						evidence of PW4 that it was the deceased who gave him 
						the originals of the indenture and said this could not 
						be true in view of the report the deceased made to the 
						police contained in the police extract - Exhibit 4. This 
						Exhibit 4 reads:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;14th November 1984 
						2.00 p.m..</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">One Seth Komla Agbosu 
						of H/No. Unknown Salesi - Somanya came to the station 
						and reported theft of original indenture in respect of a 
						piece of land bought by him at Somanya, that he highly 
						suspects his children for the theft as such wanted 
						police assistance. 2 p.m. Extract from the station diary 
						28/29 was prepared and handed over to the complainant to 
						be given to his lawyers for necessary action.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The police detective 
						who received this complaint at the station said when the 
						complaint was recorded, he told the deceased it was a 
						case of theft so there was the need to arrest his 
						children for questioning, and the deceased,</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;said he has his own 
						problem so he does not want the police to investigate 
						the matter. Seth Agbosu asked for an extract of the 
						report and I prepared it for him. So the police did not 
						investigate the matter.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">With these facts I find 
						it hard to understand counsel&#8217;s submission that PW4 was 
						not speaking the truth.&nbsp; Was it not the deceased who 
						prevented the truth from coming out by blocking police 
						investigations?&nbsp; It is clear deceased made the report 
						just to enable him secure an extract for his own purpose 
						which at the time was to enable him sell this property 
						without the knowledge and consent of the plaintiff and 
						her children and to satisfy whoever was concerned that 
						the document was in fact lost so as to pave the way for 
						a fresh one to be issued to the defendant.&nbsp; Where a fact 
						is sought to be used against a party that party must be 
						given the opportunity to know what the fact is for him 
						to decide whether to defend it or not before any 
						comment, adverse or otherwise, may be passed.&nbsp; In a 
						situation such as this where the deceased's complaint to 
						the police was not even brought to the attention of the 
						suspects mentioned, it could never be used to negative 
						or rebut any evidence given on oath before a court. I 
						reject counsel&#8217;s submission on this accordingly.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Next, counsel submitted 
						that the trial Judge did not properly appraise the 
						evidence because she completely ignored &quot;the damning 
						admissions made by PW3 &#8230;&#8230;&#8221; Counsel&#8217;s outburst stemmed

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel said by this

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The learned trial

						(1966) G.L.R. 232 at p. 240 as follows: Where admissions

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">For his part, Counsel 
						for the plaintiff/respondent submitted that PW3</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;made no admissions

						That PW3's evidence in no way corroborated that of the 
						defendants for which reason plaintiff ought to have lost 
						the suit.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial court 
						referred to the evidence of PW3 in these terms;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;PW3 also said the late 
						Agbosu told him PW7 had given him ¢2,000.00 to purchase 
						iron rods to construct the house.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">She also accepted PW3's 
						evidence that the deceased told him he was building the 
						house jointly with his wife and children.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Admittedly, the trial 
						Judge did not specifically address what appears in PW3's 
						evidence as corroborative material to the defendant's 
						case, but as I have just pointed out she took into 
						account PW3's evidence. Let us recall the totality of 
						PW3's testimony. On the building his evidence - in - 
						chief was as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The late Agbosu told 
						me he and the wife and children were jointly building a 
						house as they were being ejected from where they are 
						staying.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He also said the 
						deceased told him his son had provided money to buy iron 
						rods. From these pieces of evidence it could never be 
						interpreted that PW3 knew as a fact that the deceased 
						alone put up the house.&nbsp; And this is confirmed by the 
						evidence under cross-examination that the deceased told 
						him it was he who engaged Dawutey to construct the 
						house. Thus in all these instances PW3 was relating what 
						the deceased had told him, not what he himself knew or 
						observed as a fact. And these pieces of evidence do not 
						in any way support the defendant's case. And concerning 
						the purchase of the plot all he said was that the 
						deceased bought land from the same vendor from whom he 
						also purchased a plot later on upon the deceased's 
						introduction. That he did not know the vendor before he 
						(PW3) was introduced to him by deceased to buy his plot. 
						If one considers that deceased bought his land before 
						introducing the vendor to PW3 also to buy land from that 
						same vendor, then the only inference to be drawn from 
						the evidence of PW3 was that he was not present when the 
						deceased bought this land. Since he was not present he 
						was not in a position to know who actually provided the 
						purchase price and for whose benefit the plot was 
						purchased, hence his evidence was totally silent on 
						these very material matters. Counsel for the appellant 
						was also interested in PW3's advice to the plaintiff to 
						buy this property from the deceased which he believed 
						amounted to an admission on the part of PW3 that the 
						property was owned by the deceased. This should be 
						considered against the background that PW3's knowledge 
						was based on what the deceased had told him which must 
						have led him to think that the property was owned by the 
						deceased. An admission by conduct might have been 
						implied of the deceased's ownership of the property if 
						the plaintiff had not asserted her own right to it when 
						PW3 suggested to her that she and her children should go 
						and purchase it from the deceased. But in PW3's own 
						words &quot;the plaintiff answered that they cannot buy a 
						house they have jointly put-up,&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In appraising the 
						evidence of this witness one has to consider the fact 
						that the deceased had told him (in the absence of the 
						plaintiff) that he was putting up the house jointly with 
						the plaintiff and her children one of whom he named as 
						the provider of money for the iron rods. Then you 
						consider the fact that the plaintiff told PW3 (in the 
						absence of the deceased) that the house could not be 
						bought by her and her children because they jointly put 
						it up. The only logical inference from his evidence is 
						that the house was jointly put up by the plaintiff and 
						her children and the deceased if the court chose to 
						accept that the deceased took part in the construction.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As regards PW3&#8217;s 
						testimony that the deceased told him he engaged Dawutey, 
						that was no conclusive evidence. It would be evidence in 
						support of the defendant if in fact and in truth it was 
						the deceased who engaged Dawutey to construct the house. 
						There is abundant evidence on the record to show that it 
						was the plaintiff, and not the deceased, who engaged 
						Dawutey. Indeed Dawutey himself confirmed this. A court 
						is not entitled to reject the evidence of an eye witness 
						and a participant in an act who is available for 
						cross-examination in favour of the evidence of a person 
						who is narrating what somebody else had told him about 
						the same event, without forthcoming with good reasons, 
						to be found on the record. The totality of the evidence 
						of PW3 did not bolster the defendant's case at all so 
						the rule of evidence which was invoked is not 
						applicable.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel for the 
						appellant next took issue with the trial Judge's 
						decision as regards the view she took on the help and 
						contributions alleged to have been made by the plaintiff 
						and her children. These were the relevant findings of 
						the trial court:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;................ the 
						plaintiff and her sons contributed to the building from 
						their own resources. The plaintiff from her bakery and 
						her sons from their source of employment as</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Quantity Surveyor and 
						Internal Auditor respectively. The situation here is 
						unlike the case of the wife and a son in Adom vrs. 
						Kwarley case where the wife sold the produce from her 
						husband's vegetables farm to raise funds for the 
						building, and where the son who was his father's 
						apprentice mason worked with his father on the 
						building.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The case of Adom and 
						Another vrs. Kwarley is reported in (1962) 1 G.L.R. 112. 
						At page 113 these cases were cited: Okwabi vrs Adonu 
						(Consolidated) (1957) 2 W.A.L.R. 268: Quartey Martey and 
						Another (cited above) Adjabeng vrs. Kwabla (1960) G.L.R. 
						37. The ratio running through these cases is that 
						assistance given to a father and/or husband by a child 
						and/or wife in the former's trade which results in 
						acquisition of property by the man cannot be relied upon 
						to claim a share therein by the child and/or wife. The 
						last case cited further decides that</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;by customary law where 
						a son or a ward assists his father or guardian with 
						money, or that money together with other monies of his 
						own, to acquire property, the son or ward does not 
						become joint-owner with the father or guardian of the 
						property so acquired&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">These principles are 
						generally accepted, but it is recognised that the 
						intention of the parties before, during and after the 
						acquisition could be considered in determining whether 
						any interest was meant for the wife or son, see Abebrese 
						vrs. Kaah (1976) 2 G.L.R. 46 p. 53.&nbsp; It is also accepted 
						that where the contribution was very substantial the 
						wife or son, as the case may be, may succeed in claiming 
						an interest in the property. Also since customary law 
						recognised the right of a wife to own her own property 
						outside that of her husband, see Sarbah's Fanti 
						Customary Laws, (3rd edn) (1968) at p. 391, a view 
						accepted by Danquah in his Akan Laws and Customs at 
						pp.191 - 192, where the wife contributes to the property 
						acquisition through her own business she is entitled to 
						claim interest in the property unless a contrary 
						intention is proven.&nbsp; I think the cases cited by counsel 
						for the appellant, namely Odoteye vrs. Odoteye (cited 
						above ) Gyamaah vrs Buor (cited above) and Button vrs. 
						Button (1968) 1 W.L.R. 457 at 462 C.A. did not rule out 
						the possibility of a wife's entitlement to a share of 
						her husband's building by her contribution. In the last 
						case cited the court was concerned that the woman made 
						no contribution and that the fact that she carried out 
						certain household chores was not sufficient to give her 
						an interest. In the Odoteye case (supra) the woman's 
						claim failed because, as found by the court, she failed 
						to provide any evidence of her financial contribution to 
						the cost of the house. In the Gyamaah case (Supra), the 
						court, whilst dismissing the woman's claim, nevertheless 
						has this to say, albeit obiter, in the head notes:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;where the wife's 
						assistance takes the form of a substantial financial 
						contribution, she will be entitled as of right to a 
						share in the properties acquired by the husband.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial court judge 
						considered the relevant law and facts in arriving at her 
						decision, quite contrary to counsel for the appellant's 
						charge that she did not do so. There was sufficient 
						evidence on the record that the plaintiff contributed to 
						the purchase of the plot from her bakery business.&nbsp; 
						There is overwhelming evidence that it was the plaintiff 
						and her children, some of whom were in gainful 
						employment, who put up the house on the plot for their 
						occupation when they faced the threat of ejectment from 
						where they were living.&nbsp; The trial court's conclusion 
						cannot therefore be faulted on grounds 1, 2, and 3 in 
						view of the three reasons advanced by counsel for the 
						appellant and I accordingly dismiss them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I move next to ground 
						4. Having found for the plaintiff, the trial court held 
						&quot;that the defendant did not acquire any legal title or 
						interest in the property in dispute as the late Agbosu 
						not being the sole owner could not dispose of it without 
						the knowledge and consent of the plaintiff&#8221;. So she 
						declared the purported sole by the late Agbosu Seth to 
						the defendant null and void and set it aside.&quot; Counsel 
						for the appellant submitted that</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;the worse scenario 
						that could happen to the defendant in this drama 
						assuming the plaintiff was able to prove her joint 
						ownership was to divide the property and give the 
						portion of Seth K. Agbosu to the defendant Seth Agbosu 
						did not&nbsp; die before the property was sold to invoke the 
						right of survivorship which is not the present law in 
						Ghana &#8212; see section 14(3) of the Conveyancing Decree, 
						N.R.C.D. 175. The deceased disposed of his interest in 
						the property in his life time and a purchaser in the 
						person of the defendant acquired a valid interest. There 
						was therefore no basis for the learned trial Judge to 
						set the sale aside and declare title in the property in 
						favour of the plaintiff &#8212; a claim which has been 
						abandoned in preference to joint ownership.&#8221; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff went to 
						court seeking declaration of title to the whole land 
						with building thereon, and not a part of it. The 
						averments made it clear the deceased contributed nothing 
						to the construction of the house. The defendant did not 
						plead that he only bought the interest of the deceased 
						in this property, he claimed he purchased the entire 
						land with the building thereon. There is no 
						counter-claim for a fifty-percent interest in the 
						property, so either the defendant gets the whole or 
						nothing at all. Either party not having put in a claim 
						for only a part, it will be wrong for the court to 
						apportion the property between the parties, for that 
						will be substituting an entirely different case for the 
						parties, which practice the Supreme Court disapproved of 
						in the case of Dam vrs. J.K. Addo and Brothers (1962) 2 
						G.L.R. 200.&nbsp; I reject this ground accordingly.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Next, is ground 5. 
						Counsel submitted that the tort of trespass to land 
						consists of a direct, intentional or negligent intrusion 
						or interference with land in possession of another. That 
						is a correct view of the law. He continued &quot;The late 
						Seth K. Agbosu was owner in possession of the said 
						property and sold same to the defendant who after the 
						purchase was placed in possession. How can that in law 
						amount to trespass?&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">For his part counsel 
						for the respondent said the appellant was put on notice 
						prior to the purchase of the plaintiff&#8217;s interest in 
						this property and yet he went ahead to purchase it 
						thereby deliberately committing a trespass thereto.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial court 
						rejected the defendant's claim to be a bona fide 
						purchaser. It found the defendant was warned by 
						plaintiff and her children not to purchase this 
						property. The dismissal of this claim was not one of the 
						grounds of appeal, and even if it had been raised I 
						would have dismissed it for the same reasons given by 
						the trial Judge. Where a person is put on notice that 
						property he seeks to buy does not belong to his vendor 
						and he goes ahead to buy it he is clearly acting 
						negligently or even recklessly and so his entry upon the 
						property is clearly trespassory. And so long as 
						plaintiff was able to prove title to the land and to the 
						building thereon and even the economic trees on the land 
						she was effectively in possession (in the absence of 
						anybody being in physical possession) for the purposes 
						of satisfying possession in the law of trespass. It has 
						been held in Seraphim vrs, Amua-Sekyi (1962) 1 GLR. 328, 
						holding 2, that the presence of mango and other economic 
						trees prior to the purchase by the defendant proved that 
						the land was in the possession of someone. In this case 
						apart from economic trees, there was a building on the 
						land which proved possession in somebody who has been 
						found on the evidence to be the plaintiff and her 
						children.&nbsp; The defendant is saying he bought the house 
						from the co-owner so he committed no trespass.&nbsp; I have 
						held already that was not the case he set up so he 
						cannot now seek shelter under joint or co-ownership, 
						something he never accepted.&nbsp; The unassailable evidence 
						is that the deceased abhorred the idea of building at 
						Somanya and so consented to the wife (a native of 
						Somanya) and her children to build there.&nbsp; Thus as her 
						husband and father the deceased might have been allowed 
						to occupy this house if he were alive but beyond that he 
						would not, and did not, have the right to sell the 
						house.&nbsp; The law is that a defendant, if he acted on the 
						authority of his vendor, must prove that the vendor was 
						the real owner; where the vendor was not the real owner, 
						such a defendant commits trespass if he enters the 
						land.&nbsp; And even if the vendor is a co-owner he is not 
						entitled to sell the property all by himself, if he does 
						the purchaser if he assumed possession of the property 
						commits trespass even if he did not know of the 
						co-owner&#8217;s lack of authority to sell.&nbsp; See the case of 
						Bucknor vrs. Essien (1963) 1 G.L.R. 426 S.C.&nbsp; 
						Accordingly I dismiss this ground of appeal too.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The final leg of this 
						appeal is ground 6.&nbsp; The trial court Judge considered 
						the search documents emanating from the Lands Department 
						dubious.&nbsp; Her reasons were these:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Exhibit 1, a copy of 
						the search report is not dated.&nbsp; Exhibit 5 an 
						application for a search was dated 6th December, 1984.&nbsp; 
						Exhibit 6, the original search report prepared at the 
						Lands Secretariat, Koforidua bears the stamp of Accra 
						Lands Department dated 4th December 1984, two days 
						before an application for search was made.&nbsp; The entries 
						were dated 7th December, 1984. No explanation was 
						offered for this jumble in date.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel for the 
						appellant referred to these exhibits and said he did not 
						see the basis for the trial court&#8217;s conclusion.&nbsp; It 
						behoves us to examine these exhibits ourselves. Counsel 
						for the appellant said Exhibit 1 is the official search 
						result form issued from the Koforidua Registry of land.&nbsp; 
						But it is clear Counsel did not address the reason 
						raised by the trial Judge that this report was undated, 
						which is an undeniable fact.&nbsp; Thus how could the court 
						determine that it was prepared at the request of the 
						defendants and if so on what date so as to help the 
						court determine whether indeed he did make this search 
						before the purchase.&nbsp; The date of the search was 
						relevant in considering the question of bona fide 
						purchaser without notice.&nbsp; The trial Judge was right in 
						not attaching any weight to it for lack of date.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Exhibit 5, it is true, 
						is a letter from defendant&#8217;s solicitor Mr. Sam Okudjeto 
						addressed to the Registrar of Lands, Koforidua, calling 
						for a search in respect of a piece of land.&nbsp; The trial 
						court, from its decision, gave no consideration at all 
						to this letter and indeed rejected it for reasons I have 
						quoted above.&nbsp; She also rejected Exhibit 6 which appears 
						to be the response to Exhibit 4.&nbsp; I think the trial 
						Judge&#8217;s conclusion on these two exhibits cannot be 
						supported.&nbsp; The reason being that though Exhibit 5 was 
						addressed to the Registrar of Lands at Koforidua, yet 
						Exhibit 6 which is a pre-designed form states that &#8220;the 
						report may be collected from the Chief Registrar of 
						Lands, 28th February Road Accra fourteen clear working 
						days &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. after the delivery to him of this application&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Thus it is nothing 
						&#8220;dubious&#8221; for the report to be actually signed by the 
						Chief Registrar of Lands in Accra.&nbsp; I think the trial 
						judge fell into the error by mis-reading the date on the 
						report Exhibit 6 which is 7th December, 1984 to be 4th 
						December, 1984, which made the report appear to 
						ante-date the application.&nbsp; From the judgment she had 
						the original exhibit before her and the way the &#8220;7&#8221; is 
						written could not easily be mis-read to be &#8220;4&#8221; The 
						mistake is regrettable.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">For the purposes of 
						this appeal what we have to consider is whether the 
						error led her to decide a key issue against the 
						defendant thereby occasioning a grave miscarriage of 
						justice.&nbsp; It is undeniable that it is not every error by 
						a Judge which vitiates his decision, except that which 
						influences the decision in some serious way.&nbsp; From the 
						judgment these exhibits were being considered in 
						relation to defendant&#8217;s plea of bona fide purchaser.&nbsp; 
						The rejection of these exhibits meant the trial court 
						did not find defendant made the search.&nbsp; Whether he made 
						a search or not, the plaintiff herself admitted that the 
						documents on the property were all in the name of the 
						deceased, see paragraph 3 of the Reply filed on 21st 
						May, 1987.&nbsp; Thus these search exhibits 1, 5 and 6 
						introduced nothing new to the case, for the principle of 
						law is that where facts are admitted no evidence need be 
						led on them.&nbsp; The plaintiff never denied the defendant&#8217;s 
						averment that he caused a search to be made at the Lands 
						Registry which confirmed the deceased&#8217;s title to the 
						land.&nbsp; Thus these facts were not in dispute and the 
						trial court just had to consider them which she did when 
						she rejected the defence.&nbsp; More importantly, the search 
						result did not confer an indefeasible title in 
						defendant&#8217;s vendor, let alone in him (defendant).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Besides, apart from 
						these exhibits which were rejected, the court found as a 
						fact that the defendant was warned against the purchase 
						of this property and was manifestly aware of other 
						interest in it before he purchased it.&nbsp; Thus even though 
						the searches disclosed the deceased as owner, as I said 
						that was not indefeasible.&nbsp; Thus apart from the fact 
						that these exhibits only sought to confirm facts which 
						had been admitted on the pleadings and thus totally 
						unnecessary to prove at the trial, they did not 
						constitute a defence to the plaintiff&#8217;s charge that they 
						personally warned him against the sale and also by the 
						posting of notice on the building.&nbsp; The defendant cannot 
						be heard to say that he ignored the verbal warning and 
						hearing notice on the building because his searches at 
						the lands told him the property belonged to the 
						deceased.&nbsp; He was duly fixed with notice.&nbsp; Thus in my 
						view the error caused by the Judge had no bearing at all 
						on the issues decided in this action.&nbsp; And moreover the 
						trial court did not decide the case in favour of the 
						plaintiff because she found these exhibits dubious.&nbsp; I 
						will dismiss this ground of appeal too.</span></p>
