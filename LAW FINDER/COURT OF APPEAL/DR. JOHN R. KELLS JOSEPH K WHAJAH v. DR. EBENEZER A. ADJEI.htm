						<span style="font-family: Arial">LAMPTEY, J.A.: </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The suit now on appeal 
						before this court was commenced pursuant to an order 
						made by Mrs. Akoto-Bamfo, J. (as she then was) dated 
						23rd February, 1993. That order reads as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Plaintiffs as 
						executors of the 1989 Will do issue a writ of summons 
						within 14 days asking the court to pronounce on the 
						validity of the said Will&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In due course, John 
						Kells 1st plaintiff and Joseph Kwesi Whajah 2nd&nbsp; 
						plaintiff (hereinafter referred to as the plaintiffs) 
						sued Dr. Ebenezer Ako Adjei, 1st defendant and Francis 
						Kaku Mensah 2nd defendant (hereinafter referred to as 
						the defendants) in the High Court, Accra. The plaintiffs 
						claimed the reliefs endorsed on the writ of summons. The 
						defendants resisted the claim of the plaintiffs on the 
						ground that the said 1989 Will was a forged document; as 
						well as other serious allegations. They counter-claimed 
						for the reliefs spelt out in the statement of defence 
						and counter-claim. In due course, two other persons, 
						Rexona Kim Blay Miezah and Francis Kolorah Blay Miezah 
						applied to the court to be joined as parties. They were 
						on the orders of the trial court joined as 3rd&nbsp; and 4th 
						defendants respectively. Pursuant to the order joining 
						them, Solicitors acting for them filed their statement 
						of defence. Pleadings closed and the case proceeded to 
						trial. Hearing commenced on the 12th of June, 1995. The 
						parties and their witnesses were heard by the trial 
						court. On 20th May, 1997 the trial judge read her 
						judgment in the case. By that judgment she declared &#8220;(1) 
						that the 1989 Will of the late Dr. Blay Miezah was 
						valid; (2) that the 1988 Will of the late Dr. Blay 
						Miezah was not valid; (3) that exhibit &quot;13&quot; was valid, 
						adding that exhibit 13 can stand on its own; (4) that 
						Dr. Blay Miezah did not intend Exhibit&nbsp; &#8220;16&#8221; to be a 
						testamentary document or a Will&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 1st and 2nd 
						defendants were aggrieved by the judgment and appealed 
						to this Court on a number of grounds of appeal. Notice 
						of additional grounds of appeal were subsequently filed 
						by lawyers for the defendants without leave of this 
						court. Pursuant to the rules of court that is, C.I. 19 
						lawyers acting for the parties to this appeal filed 
						their respective statements of case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I must begin this 
						judgment by identifying and pointing out the real issue 
						which the trial judge was called upon to make a 
						decision. The summons for direction was argued out fully 
						by lawyers for the parties. The trial judge in a written 
						ruling dated 18th May, 1995 set down the following issue 
						for trial.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;It is proper therefore 
						for this court to deal with the 1989 Will exclusively 
						for now. Having done that the case will proceed 
						according to further orders which the court will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						give depending on the decision son the 1989 Will. If it 
						is found to be valid it will then remain for the court 
						to determine as between the two Wills which is to be 
						admitted to probate&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I understand the first 
						sentence to mean that the trial judge set down for trial 
						the issue of the validity of the 1989 Will. It seems to 
						me that the jurisdiction of the trial judge was in</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">the special 
						circumstances of this case, circumscribed and limited to 
						a consideration of the validity of the 1989 Will as 
						ordered made by Mrs. Akoto-Bamfo J.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my view the second 
						part of the Ruling of the trial judge cannot be 
						supported in law. The law has provided rules of court to 
						be mandatorily observed in an application for proof of a 
						testamentary document or will either in solemn form or 
						in common form. Indeed to obtain probate of the 1988 
						Will, the defendants were enjoined to observe and follow 
						the legal method prescribed by the rules, namely, prove 
						the 1988 Will, either in common form or in solemn form. 
						By way of further explanation of the issue of law I have 
						raised, I will use the illustration of a petition for 
						divorce. A party cannot issue a writ of summons and by 
						it claim and pray that an existing and subsisting 
						marriage be declared dissolved. The rule of law enjoined 
						a party who seeks a dissolution of marriage to take out 
						a petition for divorce. In the instant appeal, I find 
						that 1st defendant was not in law entitled to 
						counter-claim for a declaration that the 1988 Will was 
						valid. In due course, I will return to consider the 
						ground of appeal in relation to the dismissal of the 1st 
						defendant's counter-claim in relation to the 1988 Will.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I must observe that the 
						appeal record ran into four volumes of printed books. 
						Each volume ran into over 300 pages; except of course, 
						volume 4 which contained 70 pages. The plaintiffs put in 
						evidence 42 documents of varying pages of printed 
						material. The defendants were not to be out-done and 
						tendered 43 documentary exhibits some of which ran into 
						several pages of printed material. At the instance of 
						the trial court 12 documents were put in evidence. I 
						have found that a fairly large number of these 
						documentary exhibits were not relevant in considering 
						the real issue in dispute between the parties. I was not 
						surprised to note and observe that lawyers for the 
						parties did not advert to these documents and exhibits 
						in their respective addresses. Consequently the trial 
						judge did not also refer to and consider evidence 
						contained in these documents and exhibits.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this court, counsel 
						for the parties failed and or omitted to refer to and 
						rely on the large number of documents and exhibits that 
						were put in evidence. The reason is clear and plain. The 
						documents and exhibits were patently irrelevant and 
						dealt with extraneous matters. I must conclude my 
						lamentation by adopting the opinion of Hayfron-Benjamin 
						J.S.C. in the recent Supreme Court case (unreported) 
						entitled </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Republic v. High Court, 
						Accra Ex-Parte: Dr. John Kells dated 8th February 1994 
						in Suit No. CM.4093. He expressed the opinion 
						following:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;A careful examination 
						of the affidavit and exhibits presented by both the 
						Applicant ... and the Respondent&#8230;..show that counsel 
						dealing with the estate seriously misconceived the law, 
						practice and procedure with respect to the 
						administration of estates&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At page 7 of the report 
						Wiredu, J.S.C. gave the following directions:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;In addition, the 
						continued existence of the Letters of Administration is 
						a hindrance to either party a grant of probate to the 
						Will each claims to possess and which each intends to 
						prove in court. As such it will be in the interest of 
						both parties to have the same vacated in order to open 
						the gate for the parties to have access to the court to 
						prove whatever Wills are in their possession&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Before I consider the 
						appeal on the merits, I must observe that the statement 
						of case filed on behalf of defendants was deal with 
						under specified headings or grounds viz:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;(1) was the 1989 Will 
						a forgery;</span></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The departure from the 
						style and procedure spelt out in C.I. 19 compelled me to 
						also adopt a style and procedure convenient and 
						appropriate in the special circumstances. I note that 
						lawyers for plaintiffs also lamented the novel approach 
						followed by lawyers for</span></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Turning to the

						submission it is readily apparent that in no way does it 
						conform to the criteria of an appeal argument as 
						required under C. I. 19 rules 8 (6) and rule 20 (1) and 
						(a)&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I agree with the 
						opinion expressed above. I would not however reject the 
						statement of case in this appeal. In the larger interest 
						of justice and since the grounds of appeal raised 
						serious issues of law I proceed to consider the 
						submissions and arguments made by lawyers for the 
						parties.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I must state at the out 
						set the relevant legal provisions which governed the 
						action between the parties. At Order 4 rule (1) of L.I.

						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;the court shall 
						inspect the Will and see whether it appears to be signed 
						by the testator ... and to be subscribed by witnesses in 
						the presence of the testator and in the presence of each 
						other&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I&nbsp; turn to some of the 
						decided cases on the burden of proof assumed by the 
						executors of a Will. I refer first to the former Court 
						of Appeal case of Johnson v. Maja (1951)13 WACA 290. At 
						page 295 appears the statement following:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;where there is a 
						dispute as to a Will those who propound it must clearly 
						show by evidence that prima facie, all is in order, that 
						is to say, that there has been due execution that the 
						testator had the necessary mental capacity, and was free 
						agent. Once they have satisfied the court, prima facie, 
						as to these matters&#8230;..the burden is then cast upon those 
						who attack the Will, and that they are required to 
						substantiate by evidence all allegations they have made 
						as to lack of capacity, undue influence and so forth&#8230;&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The above statement of 
						the law has been followed and applied in many cases. I 
						need not burden this judgment with the case law. The 
						true legal position on the Issue of the burden of proof 
						in the instant case was for the plaintiffs to prove due 
						execution and attestation of the 1989 Will in accordance 
						with Section 2 of Act 360. Thereafter the defendants 
						assumed the burden of proving and establishing that the 
						1989 Will was a forged document in terms of the 
						particulars of forgery pleaded in the statement of 
						defence and counter-claim. The law further enjoined the 
						defendants to attain the standard of proof of the 
						forgery as laid down in Section 13 (1) of the Evidence 
						Decree, 1975.(NRCD 323), namely, proof of the forgery 
						beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; On this issue I refer to the 
						cases of the State v. Anane Fiadzoe (1 961) 1 G.L.R. 416 
						and also The State v. Ali Kasena (1 962) 1 G.L.R. 144. 
						In law the standard of proof in this case is therefore 
						is not proof on the balance of probabilities. See on 
						this Adwabeng v. Domfeh (1996-97) SCGLR 660 at 670. As 
						per Acquah J.S.C., as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;But the Evidence 
						Decree, 1975 has imposed proof beyond reasonable doubt 
						only on prosecutions in criminal actions (section 11 
						(2)), and in proof of a commission of a crime in any 
						civil or criminal action&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Court of Appeal 
						considered the Johnson case (supra) in the very recent 
						case entitled Henry Agyekum &amp; Another v. Harriet Martey 
						Civil Appeal Number 140/97 dated 18th March, 1999 
						(unreported). Mrs. Wood, J.A. examined the earlier cases 
						on the burden of proof in such cases and in a lucid 
						judgment stated her opinion thus:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The weight of judicial 
						authority shows, that due execution of a Will may be 
						proved by means other than the testimony of an attesting 
						witness&#8230;..the law does not rule out proof</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">by other available 
						means. Indeed the burden imposed on persons seeking to 
						propound the Will is to show by evidence that prima 
						facie, all is in order, that is to say, there has been 
						due execution&#8230;..It was also perfectly legitimate for a 
						trial court to invoke the omnia praesumuntur rit esse 
						acta rule and conclude that prima facie a case of due 
						execution has been made&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The omnia praesumuntur 
						rit esse acta rule was applied and concluded that a 
						prima facie case of due execution had been made. She 
						applied the principles from both English and Ghanaian 
						cases, namely, Harris v. Knight (1890) 15 PD 170. Davis 
						v. Mayhew (1927) P.D 264; In Re Kotei (deceased) Kotei 
						v. Ollenu, and in Re Yankah (deceased). In particular, 
						she found the English case of Re Webb Smith v, Johnson 
						(1964) 2 AUER 91 helpful. In that case though the 
						original Will was lost and only the draft with an 
						attestation clause was produced to the court and the 
						witness could not recollect signing the document, the 
						court nevertheless applied the omnia praesumuntur rit 
						esse principle and admitted the Will to probate. The law 
						therefore enjoined the plaintiffs to prove and establish 
						due execution by evidence. A witness who was present at 
						the execution and attestation must be called to testify 
						if one was available in the matter. I refer to the case 
						of In re Cole (deceased) Codjoe v. Cole (1977) 2 G.I.R. 
						309. Abban, J.A. (as he then was) reproduced the 
						following passage from the English case of Wright v. 
						Sanderson (1884) 9 P.D. 149 at 163 as per Fry L.J.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;judges who have 
						presided over the Court of Probate have long been 
						accustomed to give great weight to the presumption of 
						due execution arising from the regularity ex facie of 
						the testamentary paper produced, where no suspicion of 
						fraud has occurred. In doing so they have in my opinion 
						acted rightly and wisely&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the case of Norga v. 
						Khadijatu (1984-86) 1 G.L.R. 443 at page 448 the Court 
						of Appeal applied the statement of the law in Yankah v. 
						Administrator-General (1971) 2 G.L.R. 186 at 187 as 
						follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;If it appears on the 
						face of a Will that it has been properly executed in 
						accordance with the requirements of the law the 
						presumption by law is that the testator duly 
						acknowledged it&#8221;. This general statement is subject to 
						the reservations expressed by Lindley L.J. in Tyvell v. 
						Painton (1894) P 151 at 157.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;&#8230;..in all cases where 
						circumstances excite suspicion of the court ... and 
						whatever their nature may be it is for those who 
						propound the will to remove such suspicion, and to prove 
						affirmatively that the testator knew and approved of the 
						document and it is only where this is done that the onus 
						is thrown on those who oppose the Will to prove fraud 
						and or undue influence, or whatever else they rely on to 
						displace the case for proving the Will&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Again at page 193 of 
						Parry and Clark on Wills appear the following:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;It is for the executor 
						to produce the Will if it is within his possession and

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This suit should 
						ordinarily be a Straight forward case to prove a 
						transaction that took place in a comparatively short 
						period of time; in any case, the time for each of the 
						three persons to sign the document would be less than 
						three minutes or five minutes at the most. Again the 
						evidence would in view of the time lapse be a 
						recollection of each witness of what took place. There 
						was on the evidence nothing special or extra-ordinary 
						took place on that occasion. In the Agyekum case 
						(supra). Mrs. Wood, J.A., stated the true position as

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;where neither of the

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I intend to follow and

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The first ground of 
						appeal I will deal with was that the trial judge erred 
						in law in dismissing the counter-claim of the 
						defendants. See on this additional grounds of appeal at 
						heads (6) and (7). It was argued that the defendants 
						were entitled as of right to file a counter-claim in the 
						instant action. The power and right of the defendants 
						according to their lawyers derived from Section 1 (10) 
						of Act 360. It was argued that the decision of the trial 
						judge that the 1988 Will, Exhibit 28 was a forgery was 
						given without jurisdiction. It was contended that since 
						the trial judge did not physically see and examine the 
						original document of which Exhibit 28 was a copy her 
						conclusion that the writing on the face of Exhibit 28, 
						namely, &#8220;Kaku Nana's Attendant&#8221; was a forgery cannot be 
						supported in law. It was argued that the findings of the 
						handwriting experts touching upon Exhibit 28 was not 
						supportable. This was how lawyer for 1st defendant 
						stated his </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">case:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Exhibit 28 has already 
						been admitted by a Court as genuine Will in suit No. 
						155/94 and the plaintiffs are estopped; and indeed there 
						is no evidence to support the finding of the judge that 
						it was a forgery. Alternatively the judge having ruled 
						that Exhibit 28 was not part of the trial she erred in 
						law in declaring it a forgery&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Else where in this 
						judgment I made a finding that the 1988 Will, Exhibit 28 
						was not properly before the trial judge as a document in 
						respect of which probate was sought and could be 
						granted. I gave reasons to support my finding.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I must now consider and 
						deal with the contention of lawyer for 1st defendant 
						that a court of competent jurisdiction in an earlier 
						suit declared the 1988 Will a genuine Will. In my view 
						if the true position in law is as put forward by the 
						lawyer in the instant appeal, I find myself at a loss to 
						understand and appreciate the reasons why the very same 
						lawyer introduced and made the 1988 Will an issue in the 
						instant suit. This was contained in the statement of 
						defence and counter-claim filed on behalf of 1st 3rd and 
						4th defendants at paragraphs 25 and 26:&#8212; as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;25. The defendants say 
						that the court has ruled in Suit No. F 155/94 on 13th 
						June, 1994 that the 1st and 2nd defendants are entitled 
						to grant of probate of the Will of the late Dr. John 
						Ackah Blay-Miezah together with the codicil dated 16th 
						August, 1990 and the nuncupative Will dated 9th June, 
						1992 and again in its Ruling in Suit No. F 60/94 the 
						same court stated that there is no dispute in respect of 
						the said Will.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">26.&nbsp; Wherefore the 1st 
						and 2nd defendants pray the ...court to grant them 
						probate of the will of the late Dr. John Ackah 
						Blay-Miezah in Suit No. F 155/94 &#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiffs' 
						solicitor filed a statement of defence to the 
						counter-claim and in part pleaded that &#8220;the plaintiffs 
						promptly on 20th June, 1994 filed an interlocutory 
						appeal which is still pending unheard in the Court of 
						Appeal&quot;. The plaintiffs therefore sought an order to 
						strike out the counterclaim of the defendants. As was to 
						be expected, a Reply was filed to the statement of 
						defence to the counter-claim. In the Reply the 
						defendants omitted and or failed to reply specifically 
						to the statement in the defence to the counter- claim 
						that the Ruling of the court in Suit No. F 155/94 was 
						the subject-matter of an appeal pending in the Court of 
						Appeal. Surprisingly to note, the same lawyer for the 
						defendants filed additional issues for determination 
						including at issue (4):&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;(4)&nbsp; whether or not 
						the 1st and 2nd defendants are entitled to probate in 
						Suit No. F 155/94 subject to the outcome of the appeal&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have set down and 
						reproduced the relevant state of the pleadings 
						immediately prior to the taking of the summons for 
						directions by the court. The position as revealed and 
						clearly disclosed by the pleadings was that Exhibit 28, 
						the 1988 Will, was as at the date pleadings closed, the 
						subject-matter of an appeal properly pending before the 
						Court of Appeal. As already pointed out the summons for 
						directions was argued. Counsel for the defendants in 
						arguing the summons for directions before the trial 
						court referred to and relied on Order 6 Rule 1 (10) of 
						L.I. 1515 as authority for the declaration sought in 
						respect of the 1988 Will by the counter-claim. That 
						sub-rule provides as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;1(10) A defendant to a 
						probate action who alleges that he has any claim, or is 
						entitled to any relief or of probate or Letter of 
						Administration of the estate of the deceased person 
						which is the subject-matter of the action must add to 
						his defence a counter-claim in respect of such a claim, 
						relief or remedy&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The first observation I 
						must make is that Order 6 rule 1 (10) ought to be read 
						together with Section 2 of Act 360. I apprehend that the 
						counter-claim must relate the subject-matter&nbsp; before the 
						court, that is to say, the relief or claim or remedy 
						sought by counter-claim must necessarily and 
						specifically relate to the 1989 Will. I do not think 
						that the sub-rule permitted other testamentary documents 
						to be proved in the instant action. I note further that 
						the relief sought was expressed to be subject to what 
						the Court of Appeal decided in the matter then on 
						appeal. It is trite learning that all decisions and 
						orders of the Court of Appeal are not final but are 
						subject-matter of further appeal to the Supreme Court. 
						See on this Article 131(1)(a) and (b) of the Ghana 
						Constitutional 1992. I find that the lawyer for 1st 
						defendant misdirected himself on the law in the matter 
						of the counter-claim he put forward. I agree with the 
						submission of lawyer for the plaintiffs that the trial 
						judge erred in law in failing to strike out the 
						counter-claim. I find that the 1988 Will was not 
						properly and lawfully before the trial court. The 
						proceedings relating to and touching upon the validity 
						or otherwise are nullity. The pronouncements made in 
						relation to the 1988 Will are a nullity and of no legal 
						effect.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I must conclude this 
						part of my judgment by examining the declarations made 
						by the trial judge in respect of and in relation to the 
						other testamentary documents namely, (1) Exhibit&quot;13&quot;;and 
						(2) Exhibit &quot;16&quot;. I have stated elsewhere in this 
						judgment the method prescribed by law for proving a Will 
						in either solemn form or common form. The testamentary 
						documents Exhibit &quot;13&quot; and Exhibit &quot;16&quot; must be proved 
						according to law and in terms of Section 2 of Act. 360. 
						The parties breached and ignored the mandatory procedure 
						laid down in this matter. The trial judge with respect, 
						misdirected herself in permitting the parties who on the 
						evidence were not the executors named in Exhibits &quot;13&quot; 
						and &#8220;16&#8221; to seek to prove and establish these 
						testamentary documents Exhibits &quot;13&quot; and &#8220;16&#8221; as Wills 
						of the late Dr. Blay-Miezah.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I find evidence which 
						was adduced in this trial which in my candid opinion 
						should have been rejected by the trial judge in her 
						judgment. The first piece of evidence was contained in 
						Exhibit &quot;36&quot;. On the face of Exhibit &quot;36&quot;, Dr. 
						Blay-Miezah gave US$ 15.1 billion to the Government and 
						people of Ghana. The evidential value of this document 
						is difficult if not impossible to fathom. The lawyers 
						for the parties did not advert to this piece of evidence 
						in their respective addresses.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The record of appeal 
						contained evidence in the form of an English Newspaper 
						Report on one Dr. Gordon Kells, Exhibit &quot;33&quot;. The name 
						of the party in this case is Dr. John Kells, 1st 
						plaintiff. The name Dr. Gordon Kells does not appear in 
						any of the several documents in evidence touching upon 
						and relating to the preparation, execution and 
						attestation of the 1989 Will. The newspaper report was 
						published on Friday, 14th May, 1993 and dealt with the 
						bankruptcy of Dr. Gordon Kells, a Harley Street Doctor. 
						The 1989 Will was the subject-matter properly before the 
						trial court. The testator Dr. Blay-Miezeh died in June, 
						1990. What was the relevance of Dr. Gordon Kells 
						personal problems in the instant matter? Counsel for 
						parties failed and or omitted to address the trial court 
						on the evidential value of Exhibit &quot;33&quot;. I do not find 
						it relevant.</span></p>

						<span style="font-family: Arial">I find evidence on

						US$25 million for services each of them rendered to Dr. 
						Blay-Miezeh&quot;. The case put forward that this document 
						which they themselves put in evidence was a forged 
						document was not proved beyond reasonable doubt by the 
						defendants. In any case 1st defendant Dr. Ebenezer Ako 
						Adjei and lawyer Erskine did not testify on this equally 
						important issue. Counsel for the defendant referred to

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I wish to point out 
						that Exhibit &quot;20&quot; bears the date 29th January, 1989 and 
						further that it bears the undisputed signature of Dr. 
						Blay-Miezah. The evidence of Nana Buah, FWI was that he 
						appended his signature on the date, place and time the 
						PW1 handed over Exhibit &quot;20&quot; to lawyer Erskine and not 
						on 29th January, 1989. I expected lawyer Erskine to 
						enter the witness box to assist the court on the issue 
						raised by PW1 that he signed Exhibit &quot;20&quot; in the 
						presence of lawyer Erskine. The evidence of PWl needed 
						corroboration from lawyer Erskine or a rejection by 
						lawyer Erskine. The more serious observation I must make 
						is that even if Exhibit &quot;20&quot;: was a forged document to 
						the knowledge of lawyer Erskine I&nbsp; do not see how 
						Exhibit &quot;21&quot;, the 1989 Will must, without more, be 
						classified and rebelled a forged document. The witnesses 
						who signed Exhibit &quot;20&quot; are on the face of it not the 
						same witnesses that signed Exhibit &quot;21&quot; as witnesses. 
						The subject-matter dealt with in Exhibit &quot;20&quot; is totally 
						and completely different from that of Exhibit &quot;21&quot;. 
						Thirdly, the paper on which Exhibit &quot;21&quot; was typed was 
						different from that of Exhibit 20. The fourth difference 
						I noted was that whereas the witnesses to Exhibit &quot;20&quot; 
						did not provide their addresses, the addresses of the 
						witnesses of Exhibit &quot;21&quot; stated their addresses. In my 
						candid opinion Exhibit &quot;20&quot;, without more did not and 
						could not prove and establish that the 1989 will Exhibit 
						&#8220;21&#8221; was a forged document.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my view there was 
						insufficient evidence that Exhibit &quot;20&quot; was forged. On 
						the face of Exhibit &quot;20&quot; it cannot be denied nor 
						disputed that it was signed by Dr. Blay-Miezah on the 
						29th January, 1989. It cannot be denied that, prima 
						facie, Exhibit &quot;20&quot; was witnessed by 1st Plaintiff and 
						PW1 on 29th January, 1989. In the words of PW1 he did 
						not sign Exhibit &quot;20&quot; on the 29th of January, 1989 to 
						the knowledge of lawyer Erskine. In the instant case 
						lawyer Erskine appeared as solicitor and as counsel for 
						2nd defendant with lawyer Blay. The two lawyers were 
						present in court on 11th July, 1995 and heard the 
						replies made by PW1 on Exhibit &#8220;20&#8221;. On 17th July, 1995 
						lawyer Erskine cross-examined PW1. He did not, given the 
						opportunity, ask PW1 a single question on the occasion 
						he PW1 stated he signed Exhibit &quot;20&quot; in his lawyer 
						Erskine's presence. He did not dispute nor challenge the 
						evidence of PW1 concerning and relating to what 
						transpired between PW1 and he, lawyer Erskine in the 
						witnessing of Exhibit &quot;20&quot; by PW1 in his presence. The 
						more serious observation I must make is that it was 
						never suggested to PW1 by lawyer Erskine during the 
						cross-examination that the sums of US$25 million 
						respectively mentioned in Exhibit &quot;20&quot; were meant and 
						intended to corrupt each of them. In my opinion the 
						submission that Exhibit &quot;20&quot; was forged was not proved 
						beyond reasonable doubt. I am of the further opinion 
						that Exhibit &quot;20&quot; was not evidence which proved that 
						Exhibit &quot;21&quot; the 1989 Will was a forged document. I find 
						that the submission that Exhibit &quot;20&quot; was evidence that 
						Exhibit &quot;21&quot; was forged is plainly misconceived. I 
						reject it accordingly.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my opinion the 
						various exhibits to which I have made reference should 
						and ought to have been rejected by the trial judge in 
						her judgment. In the Court of Appeal case entitled Amoah 
						v. Arthur (1987-88) 2 G.L.R. 87 the court held at (5) as 
						follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(5)&nbsp; &quot;It was the duty 
						of the trial judge to reject inadmissible evidence which 
						had been received with or without objection, during the 
						trial when he same to consider his judgment, and if he 
						failed to do so, that evidence would be rejected on 
						appeal because it was the duty of the Courts to arrive 
						at decisions based on legal evidence only.</span></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my view the case 
						cited above is clear on the law. I adopt it to support 
						my view.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The next issue I will 
						deal with is the complaint of bias made by counsel for 
						1st defendant against the trial judge. In this judgment 
						I will intentionally refrain from considering the oral 
						evidence Mrs. Pennington, PW4 gave in court in London. 
						Out of respect for counsel for 1st defendant and in view 
						of the serious issue of law raised, I feel called upon 
						to deal with and examine the complaint of bias argued by 
						counsel for 1st defendant. In her judgment the trial 
						judge expressed the following opinion on PW4:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;She both looked and 
						sounded a convincing witness of truth. She spoke without 
						ginic and without embellishing her story&#8230;..Her evidence 
						as the only available witness of the making of Exhibit 
						&quot;21&quot; is accepted by the court as quality evidence as to 
						the truth about the making of the 1989 Will&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">She came to the 
						conclusion that the evidence of PW4 &#8220;stood as a gigantic 
						mountain in the midst of hills of varying sizes&#8221;. The 
						argument of 1st defendant&#8217;s lawyer was that the use of 
						superlatives in her description of PW4 was evidence that 
						proved and established bias on the part of the trial 
						judge. In the words of counsel for 1st defendant the 
						trial judge &#8220;was carried away by passion and this 
						clouded her assessment of the evidence before her&#8221;. I 
						have real difficulty in appreciating and understanding 
						the argument put forward by lawyer for 1st defendant on 
						this issue. I apprehend that to assist the court in 
						determining the issue of bias or the real likelihood of 
						bias, lawyer for 1st defendant assumed the burden of 
						pointing to conduct of the trial judge which 
						unequivocally proved and established bias on her part. 
						In the instant appeal, the language used by the trial 
						judge in her evaluation and consideration of the 
						evidence PW4 gave was not demonstrated and showed to 
						prove and establish bias, even remotely. The language 
						may be or indeed was extravagant and flattering of PW4. 
						In my opinion the test is whether or not the choice of 
						words support the conclusion reached by the trial judge 
						as to whether a witness was truthful or not to the 
						court. Indeed it is trite learning that among matters a 
						trial judge must bear in mind and give serious attention 
						to in his judgment is the demeanour of every witness. A 
						well written judgment must on the face of it show that 
						the trial judge considered the demeanour of each and 
						every witness. Again it is otiose to state that a trial 
						judge is enjoined and obliged to give reasons to support 
						the findings of fact that he makes. The law does not 
						prescribed any particular formula, language or style to 
						be employed by a judge in writing her judgment. Since 
						these are all matters that defy legislation, the 
						individual judge is not fettered or constrained in 
						discharging this statutory duty namely, writing a 
						judgment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I must point out that 
						the lawyer for 1st defendant on his own admission was 
						not present throughout the hearing and receiving of the 
						whole of the testimony of PW4 in London. Consequently, 
						he did not have the opportunity, the advantage and 
						benefit of seeing and watching the performance of PW4 as 
						she gave her testimony in London including her 
						performance under cross-examination. In my opinion, 
						lawyer for 1st defendant was and is not in a position to 
						fairly and justifiably complain about the trial judge's 
						impression and therefore evaluation of the evidence of 
						PW4 as the same was reflected in the language she used.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my view an 
						allegation of bias when leveled against a trial judge is 
						a very serious one. The party alleging bias against a 
						trial judge must be prepared to prove and establish by 
						credible evidence bias on the part of the trial judge. 
						In the view of Lord D. Brian, C.J. in the Irish case of 
						R.V. Justices of County Cork (1910) 2 I.R. 271:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;By &quot;bias&quot; I understand 
						a real likelihood of an operative prejudice, whether 
						conscious, or unconscious. There must, in my opinion, be 
						reasonable evidence to satisfy us that there was a real 
						likelihood of bias. I do not think that the mere vague 
						suspicions of whimsical, capricious and unreasonable 
						people should be the standard to regulate our action 
						here. It might be a different matter if suspicion rested 
						on reasonable grounds&#8212;was reasonably generated; but 
						certainly mere flimsy, elusive, morbid suspicious should 
						not be permitted to form a ground of decision&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the case of 
						Attorney-General v. Sallah (digested in the 1970 C.C 54) 
						the Supreme Court adopted the test of real likelihood of 
						bias. It stated that whether there was a real likelihood 
						of bias depended on the circumstances; in other words 
						the decision must really turn on a question fact whether 
						or not there is a real likelihood of bias.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instant case, 
						the allegation of bias against the trial judge was made 
						by counsel for 1st defendant after the trial judge had 
						delivered her judgment. The allegation of bias was 
						therefore made not during the hearing on the merits but 
						was made sometime after judgment had been read on 209th 
						May, 1997. In the statement of case in which the 
						allegation of bias was made, counsel for 1st defendant 
						did not point to any act or acts or conduct of the trial 
						judge during the hearing or before she delivered her 
						judgment to prove and establish bias on her part. 
						Counsel for 1st defendant was content to reproduce 
						passages from the judgment and point to these as 
						evidence of bias without proceeding further to 
						demonstrate and establish that these were pieces of 
						evidence of bias. In the words of Lord Brien the 
						allegation of bias against the judge was the mere vague 
						suspicions of a whimsical, capricious and unreasonable 
						persons. I am satisfied that this ground of appeal 
						fails.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Since writing this 
						judgment which I had expected and hoped would have been 
						read on 29th July, 1999 that was the statement on the 
						Cause List for that date, counsel for 1st&nbsp; defendant 
						sought and obtained leave of this court to adduce new 
						and fresh evidence of bias. In pursuance of the leave 
						granted to the 1st defendant, his counsel filed a 
						further statement of case under the ground of appeal 
						that alleged bias on the part of the trial judge. 
						Counsel for plaintiffs was granted leave to reply to the 
						statement of the case of the 1st defendant. I must 
						observe that the 2nd defendant through his counsel 
						informed and indicated to the court that he was not 
						interested in these fresh proceedings. I fully 
						appreciate and understand the stand of the 2nd 
						defendant. In the present appeal the 2nd&nbsp; defendant did 
						not set down &quot;bias of the trial judge&#8221; as a ground of 
						appeal. The rules of court consequently do not clothe 
						2nd defendant with a legal right to argue a ground of 
						appeal not indicated and expressly stated in his notice 
						of appeal. In any case, 2nd&nbsp; defendant had not on the 
						record applied for leave of this court to file and 
						therefore give notice of this particular ground of 
						appeal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Pursuant to leave 
						granted to the 1st defendant new and fresh evidence was 
						received by this court. Briefly put, the fresh evidence 
						was that after the trial judge had delivered her 
						judgment she (1) granted probate of the 1989 Will to 
						only Dr. John Kells and (2) entered into written 
						correspondence and communication with Dr. John Kells. 
						The trial judge Mrs. Sawyerr-Williams testified before 
						us and indeed admitted that she granted probate to only 
						Dr. John Kells after judgment. She admitted further that 
						she engaged in written correspondent with Dr. John Kells 
						after she read her judgment. Surprisingly, to observe 
						she was not cross-examined by lawyer for 1st defendant 
						to elicit evidence to prove and establish bias on the 
						part of the judge using the new and fresh evidence. The 
						contention that Mrs. Sawyerr-Williams J. lacked 
						jurisdiction to hear and grant the application for 
						probate to only Dr. John Kells is plainly misconceived. 
						She had the right and constitutional power to sit as a 
						judge on that application. There was no evidence that 
						she had a part to play in the application being placed 
						on her Cause list for that day. There is no evidence 
						that the Chief Justice had sent Mrs. Sawyer-Williams J. 
						a query in this matter. Again I note that Mrs. 
						Sawyerr-Williams J. was not cross-examined on her 
						admission that after the judgment she wrote to Dr. Kells 
						the letter received in evidence. There was not a single 
						question during cross-examination remotely suggesting to 
						her that she acted from improper motives. I do not 
						accept the contention of counsel for 1st defendant that 
						this court must infer and assume that from the evidence 
						of the judge bias was proved and established. I would 
						not burden this judgment by re-stating the law and 
						repeating the case law to which I referred earlier. The 
						right of the 1st defendant is to appeal against the 
						grant of probate. I find that the complaint by the 
						1st&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						defendant of bias against the trial judge was not made 
						out.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A ground of appeal 
						argued was that the pleadings of the plaintiffs 
						conflicted with and contradicted the evidence on the 
						issue of the execution and attestation of Exhibit &quot;21&quot;. 
						It was contended that the pleadings showing and 
						indicating the number and identity of the persons 
						present at the execution and attestation of Exhibit &quot;21&quot; 
						conflicted with and contradicted the evidence of the 
						named witnesses. It was submitted that the trial judge 
						should have rejected the case of the plaintiffs of due 
						execution and attestation of Exhibit &quot;21&quot;. Counsel for 
						plaintiff argued the contrary. He contended that there 
						was evidence to prove and establish due execution and 
						attestation of Exhibit &quot;21&quot;. The pleading under attack 
						is paragraph 7 which reads in part as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;7.&nbsp; Out of the six 
						others present only Dr. E. Ayeh-Kumi and Mrs. Angelina 
						Pennington were invited in the presence of all the 
						others to attest the signature of the said testator 
						which he made in the presence of the said two attesting 
						witnesses who were present together and they accordingly 
						subscribed their respective signatures as witnesses in 
						the presence of the said testator and in the presence of 
						each of other and in the presence of all the others.&#8221;
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have great difficulty 
						in understanding and appreciating the expression &quot;in the 
						presence of all others&#8221; appearing twice in the passage. 
						But when I read the expression &quot;out of the six others 
						present only Dr. Ayeh-Kumi and Mrs. Pennington were 
						invited&#8221; and give that expression its ordinary meaning I 
						am left in no doubt that the execution and attention was 
						limited to and participated in by the testator, Dr. 
						Ayeh-Kumi and Mrs. Pennington within the meaning and 
						intendment of Section 2 of act 360. I do not honestly 
						understand the pleading at paragraph 7 to mean that all 
						the named and identified persons physically and actively 
						took part and participated in the attestation of Exhibit 
						&quot;21&quot;. It will be an abuse of language to give such an 
						interpretation to that pleading. I find support for my 
						conclusion in the Supreme Court case of Odametey v. 
						Clocuh (1989-90) 1 G.L.R. 14 at holding (2) as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;(2) Variations in 
						pleadings that substantially destroy the plaintiffs' 
						case were not material and could in appropriate 
						circumstances be safely ignored.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This statement was 
						expanded in the opinion of Taylor, J.S.C. as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The court however did 
						not scrutinise the nature of the new case in relation to 
						the substantive case which the plaintiff has to prove to 
						succeed and I am therefore more persuaded by the 
						dissenting view of Apaloo, J.S.C. (as he then was) who 
						in a minority view articulated in my opinion, the true 
						principle. He pointed out very convincingly at page 328 
						that the so-called variation was merely on a collateral 
						issue which was not necessary for a decision on the 
						substantive issue upon variation or conflict was 
						immaterial and the rejected it.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The test laid down is 
						sound in law. Clearly and simply expressed the principle 
						of law on this issue is that the variation or conflict 
						must be material and not merely collateral and not 
						necessary in arriving at a decision on a crucial issue. 
						The trial judge cannot be faulted in the conclusion she 
						reached on this issue, namely that out of the six 
						persons present only Dr. Ayeh-Kumi and Mrs. Pennington 
						were specifically invited for purposes of satisfying and 
						complying with Section 2 of Act. 360 to attest the 
						execution of Exhibit &quot;21&quot; by Dr. Blay-Miezah.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Indeed Order 3 Rule 
						2(2) of L.1. 1515 provides as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;2(2) If the Will 
						appear to be so signed and subscribed the court shall

						in fact executed in accordance with the Wills Act 
						..........&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The evidence from Kim 
						DW3, DW1, Kaku and DW4 Rigby that they each did not 
						witness the execution and attestation of the Will, 
						Exhibit &quot;21&quot; was the truth. The evidence that they each 
						was in the residence of Dr. Blay-Miezah on 29th January, 
						1989 was also the truth. The pleading relied on by 
						counsel for 1st defendant if read with an open and 
						unbiased mind demonstrate that it was not every one who 
						was physically present that was specially and 
						specifically invited to formally and as it were 
						officially to take an active part in the attestation of 
						the signature of Dr. Blay-Miezah. The pleading was that 
						the two persons specifically identified and mentioned by 
						names were involved in the exercise of the execution and 
						attestation of the said Will. In my view the use of the 
						expression &#8220;Out of&#8221; was sufficient and good enough to 
						destroy the argument that the evidence on this issue 
						conflicted with this particular pleading. I do not find 
						that the pleading in question conflicted with the 
						evidence on record.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this appeal a matter 
						that was seriously raised and canvassed by lawyer for 
						defendants in the statement of case was that the 
						appointment of 1st plaintiff, Dr. John Kells as (1) sole 
						executor in the said 1989 Will; and (2) sole beneficiary 
						of the properties of the late Dr. Blay-Miezah together 
						with the &quot;Fund&quot; was circumstantial evidence that the 
						said Will was a forged document. Another reason to 
						support the allegation of forgery was the failure and or 
						refusal 1st plaintiff, Dr. John Kells to appear in 
						person in court to prosecute his case. The lawyer for 
						plaintiffs did not advert to any of the above complaints 
						in his reply filed with the court. On the issue of the 
						appointment of the 1st plaintiff, Dr. John Kells as sole 
						executor, the defendants did not point to any law or 
						rule which was breached by the testator. It is a 
						testator's constitutional right to appoint any person or 
						persons of full age and sound mind to be the executor or 
						executrix. In the instant appeal, contrary to the 
						contention of the defendants, I have found evidence of 
						appointment of Dr. John Kells by Dr. Blay-Miezah to act 
						in responsible position and capacity for and our behalf 
						of Dr. Blay-Miezah and the Oman Ghana Trust Fund. See on

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The second limb of this

						a forged document. The lawyer for defendants did not 
						support this contention with the law or the rules of 
						court. No case law was cited to support this contention. 
						The lawyer for plaintiffs did not advert to this 
						complaint against the judgment. It is true that 1st 
						plaintiff did not personally appear in court to 
						prosecute the case. I am not aware of any law or rule 
						that enjoined a plaintiff to personally attend court and

						complaint that Dr. John Kells should have appeared in 
						person to prosecute is case is not supportable in law.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The third complaint 
						defendants made against the 1989 Will was that the 
						appointment of Dr. John Kells, 1st plaintiff as &quot;sole 
						beneficiary and heir ...............of all that Dr. 
						Blay-Miezah owned including those funds once known as 
						Ghana Fund but now known as the Butterfly Trust is 
						circumstantial evidence that the said Will was a forged 
						document.&quot;The lawyer for plaintiffs disputed the 
						interpretation put on the provision in the said Will. He 
						contended that the 1st plaintiff Dr. John Kells was 
						merely appointed to administer the Butterfly Trust. He 
						did, not share the opinion that 1st plaintiff, Dr. John 
						Kells was the sole beneficiary of Dr. Blay Miezah's 
						estate including the Butterfly Trust.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The first observation I 
						must make on this issue is that the trial court was not 
						called upon to determine who are beneficially entitled 
						to enjoy the properties of Dr. Blay Miezah as disclosed 
						by the said Will. The law of the land has made adequate 
						and specific provisions for any person or persons who 
						claim any interest in a testators&#8217; estate. In this 
						connection the case of In Re Ayayee (deceased); Kukubor 
						and anor. Vs. Ayayee (1982-83) G.L.R 866 is helpful and 
						instructive. At holding (3) of the report appears the 
						following:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(3) A testator had an 
						unfettered discretion to dispose of his property as he 
						chose. The discretion might sometime be influenced by 
						passion, caprice, the power of new association or ties 
						or sinister influence to the extent of excluding persons 
						whom the law placed legal obligations on the testator to 
						make provision for. There were occasions too when the 
						instinct and affections and sentiments of mankind might 
						safely lead one to make better disposition of one's 
						estate than a distribution obtained through stereotyped 
						rules of the general law&nbsp; ...............&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I do not accept the 
						bare statements that the appointment of Dr. John Kells 
						as sole executor by the 1989 Will Exhibit &#8220;21&#8221; without 
						more, was contrary to law. I do not find</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">the legal basis in 
						support of the submission. I adopt the reasoning in the 
						Ayayee case (supra) and reject the submission of counsel 
						or defendants.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In support of this 
						contention, namely the appointment of Dr. John Kells as 
						sole beneficiary the defendants testified that the 1989 
						Will was not the act and deed of Dr. Blay Miezah. The 
						trial judge permitted each defendant to give evidence on 
						this issue which was clearly inadmissible in law. The 
						testimony of each of the defendants was to a large 
						extent the opinion of that defendant on the issue of the 
						appointment of Dr. John Kells as sole beneficiary in 
						Exhibit &quot;21&quot;. The 1st defendant, Dr. Ako Adjei testified 
						as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;I found it difficult 
						that a shrewd business man would have put into the 1989 
						Will Dr. John Kells as heir and executor.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I found it very 
						difficult to believe that a shrewd man like Blay Miezah

						even his own children.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I found it very

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 3rd defendant, 
						Rozana Blay Miezah stated her opinion as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot; Miss Ofori Atta had

						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On this same issue the 
						4th defendant Francis Blay Miezah, testified as 
						follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;When Exhibit &quot;21&quot; was 
						brought, I was going through some of the documents that 
						we have in the house to see if I could find the 
						signatures of Mrs. Pennington and Ayeh Kumi to make 
						comparisons. I could not get one so Nana Asemda told me 
						that he had the passport of the late Dr. Ayeh Kumi. I 
						collected it from him and noticed that the signature on 
						this document does not agree with the one in the 
						passport. So we drew the attention of our lawyers to it. 
						I&nbsp; discussed this with lawyer Erskine and lawyer Blay 
						and later on went to lawyer Ako Adjei.&quot; He expressed his 
						opinion of Exhibit &quot;21&quot; as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;I don't think my 
						father would execute a Will and leave all his property 
						to a white man to the exclusion of all his children&quot; I 
						do not find that the above pieces of evidence which is 
						the opinion of each defendant is sufficient evidence of 
						forgery. The standard of proof of forgery is spelt out 
						at S. 13(1) of the Evidence Decree 1975 (NRCD. 323). 
						That sub-section reads:&#8212;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>

						or criminal action the burden of persuasion as to the

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I&nbsp; reject the evidence 
						from the defendants reproduce above as evidence that the 
						1989 Will was forged.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This leads me to the 
						main ground of appeal, namely, the trial judge erred in 
						law when she rejected the case of the defendants that 
						the 1989 Will was a forged document. The lawyer&nbsp; for 
						defendants submitted that the evidence to prove and 
						establish that exhibit &quot;21&quot; was forged, though 
						circumstantial was credible. It was contended that the 
						evidence to prove and establish the preparation, the 
						execution and attestation was conflicting and 
						contradictory. In support of this submission the lawyer 
						for defendants contended first that the 1989 Will was 
						not prepared by a lawyer. This fact was some 
						circumstantial evidence of forgery of Exhibit &quot;21&quot;. The 
						lawyer for the plaintiff did not advert to this 
						complaint in his statement in reply.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The complaint was that 
						in so far as Exhibit '21' was not prepared by a lawyer 
						the document was a forged document. This submission was 
						not supported by legal authority. This court was not 
						referred to any law or rule which mandatorily required 
						that a Will or testamentary document must be prepared by 
						a lawyer to clothe it with legal validity. I am not 
						aware of any case that decided that a Will is only valid 
						in law if it was prepare by a lawyer. Indeed in the 
						instant appeal the same lawyers put in evidence Wills 
						and testamentary documents not prepared by lawyers. They 
						sought orders admitting these testamentary documents to 
						probate. See on this: Exhibit '6', Exhibit.'13&#8217; Exhibit 
						'16' and Exhibit '28'. I do not find that the 
						preparation of the 1989 Will Exhibit &#8216;21&#8217; by a person 
						who is not lawyer supported the charge of forgery of 
						that document.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The second limb to 
						prove and establish the charge of forgery was that the 
						1989 Will Exhibit '21' was not the act and deed of Dr. 
						Blay Miezah. The lawyer for defendants contended that 
						the paper on which Exhibit '21' was typed had been 
						signed in blank by Dr. Blay Miezah, that the 
						dispositions in Exhibit '21' were subsequently and 
						without the knowledge and consent of Dr. Blay Miezah 
						typed on the signed blank paper and held out as the act 
						and deed of Dr. Blay Miezah. Thereafter the signature of 
						Dr. Ayeh Kumi was forged on Exhibit '21' to make it 
						appear that Dr. Ayeh Kumi attested the Will. In reply 
						counsel for plaintiffs pointed to evidence on record to 
						prove and establish that Exhibit&nbsp; '21' was the act and 
						deed of Dr. Blay Miezah. There was evidence that Dr. 
						Ayeh Kumi attested the signature of Dr. Blay Miezah in 
						the presence of Mrs. Pennington, PW4 who also attested 
						the signature of Dr. Blay Miezah.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The above ground 
						required detailed examination of the evidence on record 
						that relate to and touch upon the several issues raised. 
						The first issue was whether or not the 1989 Will, 
						Exhibit '21' was the act and deed of Dr. Blay Miezah. 
						The case of the plaintiffs as contained in Exhibit '9', 
						the affidavit evidence of Mrs. Pennington read as 
						follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;I am Mrs. Edda 
						Angelina Pennington&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.of London&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.nurse make oath and 
						say as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1) I am the second of 
						the subscribing witnesses to the last Will and testament 
						dated 29th&nbsp; January, 1989 of the above-named Dr. John 
						Ackah&nbsp; Kells Blay Miezah&nbsp; ...................</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) The said testator 
						executed the said Will on the day and date of by signing 
						the name at the foot or end thereof, as the same new 
						appears thereon in the presence of myself and Dr. 
						Emmanuel Ayeh Kumi. The other and first subscribed 
						witness thereto.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(3) At the same time 
						when the said testator signed the said Will in the 
						manner aforesaid, both Dr. Ayeh Kumi&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.and I were both 
						present at the same time and we thereupon attested and 
						subscribed to the said Will in the presence of him and 
						the testator &#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I must observe that 
						this crucial evidence in exhibit '9' was put in evidence 
						at the instance of the defendants. Before us, this 
						document Exhibit '9' had not been impeached by the 
						defendants on any legal ground. Prima facie, the 
						plaintiffs evidence of due execution and attestation of 
						Exhibit '21', the 1989 Will was proved and established 
						by the affidavit evidence contained in Exhibit '9'. I 
						adopt the opinion of Mrs. Wood JA in the Agyekum case 
						(supra), I&nbsp; find that the undisputed and unchallenged 
						affidavit evidence of PW4 put in evidence by defendants 
						was credible evidence of due execution and attestation 
						of the 1989 Will of Dr. Blay Miezah.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Defendants contended 
						that a signed blank letter headed sheet of paper was 
						&quot;obtained&quot; and used to prepare Exhibit '21' the 1989 
						Will. They did not point to evidence on record to 
						identify the persons who obtained the blank signed 
						letter headed paper and directed and dictated the 
						contents of Exhibit '21'. Be that as it may, I must 
						consider the evidence of DW5, Mr. Adipah on this issue. 
						The evidence of Mr. Adipah DW5 was not challenged by the 
						plaintiffs. DW5 testified that on at least 22 separate 
						occasions Dr. Blay Miezah handed over to him already 
						signed but blank-letterhead sheets of paper. That on 
						each such occasion, Dr. Blay Miezah either indicated or 
						dictated to him DW5 what material or information he DW5 
						should type on the blank but already signed sheets of 
						paper. To persuade the trial court that he spoke the 
						truth and nothing but the truth on this issue, DW5 put 
						in evidence a Blay Miezah signed blank letter headed 
						sheet of paper as Exhibit '34'. This document Exhibit 
						'34' apart from bearing the signature of Dr. Blay Miezah 
						bore the date 18th April, 1985 and is blank, that is, 
						nothing was typed on it. I have anxiously and seriously 
						considered the evidence of DW5. Am I to conclude that 
						the 22 documents referred to in the evidence of DW5 were 
						all without exception forged documents? Do I&nbsp; accept the 
						evidence of DW5 as evidence that he DW5 forged the 22 
						documents, merely because Dr. Blay Miezah signed the 
						sheets in blank and thereafter handed each of them to 
						DW5 to enable him complete each document with 
						information from Dr. Blay Miezah. If the evidence of DW5 
						was accepted and believed as evidence of the modus 
						operandi of Dr. Blay Miezah then it was not open to the 
						defendants to impeach Exhibit '2' the 1989 Will as a 
						forged document, because the evidence of PW4 was that 
						Dr. Blay Miezah handed to her a blank sheet to type on 
						it, information he Dr. Blay Miezah gave to her and she 
						did that.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I cannot conclude this 
						aspect of the submission of counsel without expressing 
						my concern that up to the date DW5 gave evidence, that 
						is, May 1996 he DW5 kept in his possession the blank but 
						signed and dated letter headed sheet, that is Exhibit 
						'34'. The evidence DW5 gave was that on each and every 
						occasion that he DW5 was handed a&nbsp; blank but signed 
						letter headed sheet by Dr. Blay Miezah he DW5 received 
						specific instructions concerning what he should type on 
						such blank but signed sheet of paper. DW5 received 
						Exhibit '34' on 18th April, 1985, he was not asked to 
						tell the court why he kept Exhibit '34' and why he 
						failed to carry out the instructions and wishes of Dr. 
						Blay Miezah. In my opinion, the evidence of DW5 did not 
						even remotely prove and establish that the 1989 Will 
						Exhibit &#8220;21&#8221; was not the act and deed of Dr. Blay 
						Miezah.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The third limb of the 
						submission of the lawyer for defendants that the 1989 
						Will Exhibit '21' was a forged document was that the 
						trial judge erred in accepting the evidence that Dr. 
						Ayeh Kumi and Mrs. Pennington were present in the 
						residence of Dr. Blay Miezah on 29th January, 1989. It 
						was contended that the evidence to prove and establish 
						that Dr. Ayeh Kumi was present in the residence of Dr. 
						Blay Miezah on 29th January, 1989 was so conflicting and 
						contradictory that the trial judge should have rejected 
						it. They pointed to evidence from DW1, Kaku DW3 Kim and 
						DW4 Rigby which in substance was that neither Dr. Ayeh 
						Kumi, nor Mrs. Pennington was present in the residence 
						of Dr. Blay Miezah on 29th January, 1989. They argued 
						that Dr. Ayeh Kumi and Mrs. Pennington did not therefore 
						attest the signature of Dr. Blay Miezah on Exhibit 
						'21'on that date.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In reply, counsel for 
						the plaintiffs referred to and relied on the evidence of 
						Nana Buah PW1, Shenton PW2 and Rice PW3 as well as 
						affidavit evidence from Mrs. and Pennington. He argued 
						that the evidence was neither conflicting nor 
						contradictory. He submitted that the evidence clearly 
						showed that both Dr. Ayeh Kumi and Mrs. Pennington were 
						each present with Dr. Blay Miezah in his London 
						residence on 29th&nbsp; January 1989. The evidence supported 
						the finding of the trial judge that Pw4 and Dr. Ayeh 
						Kumi witnessed the signature of Dr. Blay Miezah on the 
						29th January, 1989 in the presence of each other.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I propose to deal first 
						with the issue whether or not PW4 Mrs. Pennington was 
						present in the residence of Dr. Blay Miezah on 29th 
						January, 1989 and further whether or not she attested 
						the signature of Dr. Blay Miezah within the meaning and 
						intendment of S.2 of Act 360. Elsewhere in this judgment 
						I have made a finding that the affidavit evidence from 
						PW4 was evidence that she did attest the signature of 
						Dr. Blay Miezah as required by law. Apart from the 
						affidavit evidence from PW4, there were clear and 
						undisputed pieces of evidence contained in exhibit 'C', 
						Exhibit '9' and Exhibit '31' to the effect that PW4, 
						Mrs. Pennington was present with Dr. Blay Miezah on 29th 
						January, 1989. In Exhibit 'C' Dr. Blay Miezah wrote on 
						29th June, 1990 in part as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Also release the 
						sealed envelope I gave to you. (Dr. John Kells the first 
						plaintiff herein) on 29th January, 1989&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;in the 
						presence of James Kaku (DW1 in this case) and Mrs. 
						Pennington (PW4) to Mr. Ngethe Njorege.&#8221; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This piece of evidence 
						was not impeached by defendants as not true. The 
						evidence of DW1, that Mrs. Pennington was not one of the 
						persons who met with Dr. Blay Miezah in his Dr. Blay 
						Miezah residence on 29th January, 1989 was not the 
						truth. I make bold to state that DW1 Kaku told 
						deliberate and calculated lies to the court on this 
						issue. From the clear evidence of DW1 he was the only 
						person on duty on 29th January, 1989 with instruction 
						from Dr. Blay Miezah to open and admit into the 
						residence of Dr. Blay Miezah any and every person Dr. 
						Blay Miezah wished to meet with. This was the evidence 
						DW1 gave on this important issue:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;If a visitor was 
						coming to the house and he got to the gate where the 
						security men were (on duty) I would not talk to them 
						because I was in the house. The visitor would get access 
						to the place after he had spoken to the security men who 
						would then talk to Nana. If Nana want to see the person 
						he would tell me. I would then let the person in. When 
						I&nbsp; opened the door and a visitor entered I would take 
						them to a room where the visitors sat when they came 
						in.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This detailed and 
						comprehensive account and description of the procedure 
						routinely and religiously to be followed by DW1 Kaku 
						leaves me in no doubt that he admitted and let into the 
						home of Dr. Blay Miezah on 29th January, 1989. Dr. John 
						Kells, 1st&nbsp; plaintiff Mrs. Pennington PW4 and Dr Ayeh 
						Kumi.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There was evidence from 
						Kim DW3 and Rigby DW4 that they each were engaged in 
						packing bag and baggage of Dr. Blay Miezah on 29th 
						January 1989. They each testified that they each did not 
						see Mrs. Pennington PW4 and Dr. Ayeh Kumi in the 
						premises and residence of Dr. Blay Miezah on that date. 
						I quite agree and accept their evidence that they each 
						did not see PW4 or Dr. Ayeh Kumi in the residence of Dr. 
						Blay Miezah. Both DW3 and DW4 were not employed as 
						security men on 29th January, 1989. They swore that they 
						were engaged in packing bag and baggage of Dr. Blay 
						Miezah and sent same to the Airport in London. They each 
						did not relate the above evidence to the time or times 
						during that day that they discharged their said duties. 
						Common sense informs me that DW3 and DW4 would shuttle 
						from inside the rooms into the yard or compound carrying 
						bag and baggage. The nature and type of work, that is, 
						packing bag and baggage in the room or rooms and 
						carrying or conveying these outside would not afford DW3 
						and DW4 opportunity to know and identify and yard every 
						person who was first admitted through the locked gates 
						by the security men into the compound and thereafter 
						admitted by Kaku DW1 into the residence. In my candid 
						opinion, the evidence of DW4 that he was not in a 
						position to see and identify all persons wishing to see 
						Dr. Blay Miezah was the truth. The evidence of DW4 was 
						as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;If any of the above 
						people&nbsp; ..................... had come to the house. I 
						would not necessarily see them but I would be aware of 
						their coming to the house.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">DW4 was not asked to 
						tell the court how he would become aware of persons 
						coming to the house since he was engaged in packing bag 
						and baggage of Dr. Blay Miezah. The plain truth was that 
						DW 4 was not in a position to know and identify the 
						visitors to Dr. Blay Miezah's house on 29th January, 
						1989. Dw3 was in the same position as Dw4.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The other leg of the 
						submission of counsel for defendant was that Dr. Ayeh 
						Kumi was not present in the house of Dr. Blay Miezah on 
						29th January, 1989. There was ample evidence which 
						proved and established that Dr. Ayeh Kumi was present 
						with Dr. Blay Miezah in his residence on 29th January, 
						1989. I have elsewhere in this judgment held that DW3 
						and DW4 were not in a position to see and identify the 
						persons who called to see and meet with Dr. Blay Miezah 
						on 29th January, 1989. The evidence that they each did 
						not see Dr. Ayeh Kumi come to the residence of Dr. Blay 
						Miezah did not, without other evidence prove that Dr. 
						Ayeh Kumi was not present on that date. I have also made 
						a finding that the memory of DW1 Kaku and his 
						recollection of what happened on 29th January, 1989 in 
						the residence of Dr. Blay Miezah was most unreliable. I 
						have great difficulty in examining and evaluating the 
						evidence of DW4 Righy. Before the trial court were two 
						documents sworn to by DW4 Rigby. These are Exhibit '31' 
						and Exhibit '32'. In the first and earlier document, 
						Exhibit '31'&nbsp; he admitted he drove Dr. Ayeh Kumi to the 
						residence of Dr. Blay Miezah on 29th January, 1989. 
						Within the comparatively short period of six days DW4 
						changed his unequivocal and clear statement in exhibit 
						'31' by another sworn document Exhibit '32'. For the 
						avoidance of doubt, I reproduce the sworn statement as 
						contained in Exhibit '31' put in evidence by the 
						defendants. DW4 deposed as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In order to leave no 
						doubt in the mind of anyone reading this document DW4 
						Rigby added the following for good value:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;I have particular 
						memory of this occasion for the following reasons:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1)&nbsp; This was the only 
						occasion when I was require to drive Dr. Ayeh Kumi from 
						his house to 60 Avenue Road.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2)&nbsp; This was the last 
						time I saw Dr. Ayeh Kumi.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(3)&nbsp; Shortly after this 
						occasion Dr. Blay Miezah departed from UK for Ghana.&quot; 
						The above unequivocal evidence was contained in Exhibit 
						'31'. The defendants themselves put in evidence Exhibit 
						'32' in which document DW4 Rigby stated that he DW4 made 
						a mistake in exhibit '31'. This was what he stated in 
						Exhibit '32' to enable him to correct Exhibit '31'.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Since making that 
						statement (Exhibit '31') I&nbsp; have learned that Dr. Blay 
						Miezah departed the UK for Ghana on 29th January l989, 
						which my memory erroneously placed at 3rd&nbsp; February, 
						1989&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is clear from the 
						expression used by DW4 namely &#8220;I have since learnt&#8221; that 
						he discussed the contents of Exhibit '31' with a person 
						or persons after he made it. As a result of that 
						discussion he quickly changed his earlier sworn 
						statement and swore to another affidavit, Exhibit '32'. 
						I have no doubt that DW4 Rigby allowed himself to be 
						manipulated and unduly influenced by some persons to 
						swear to Exhibit '32'. I find support for my conclusion 
						from the following passage from exhibit '32'. DW4 swore 
						as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;I have made an error 
						in placing the date as 29th January, 1989. If my 
						statement of 11th&nbsp; January 1995 (Exhibit '31') has 
						caused any misunderstanding or has misled any 
						deliberations then I apologize and beg for forgiveness 
						of those concerned.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I am amazed that the 
						lawyer for the defendant put in evidence Exhibit '32'. 
						To whom was DW4 offering his heartfelt apology? What was 
						the misunderstanding, that DW4 had created? Whom was he 
						misleading? What was the evidential value of Exhibit 
						'32'? Exhibit '32' was not a retraction of DW4's 
						evidence that on 29th January, 1989 he drove Dr. Ayeh 
						Kumi to the residence of Dr. Blay Miezah. My opinion is 
						that DW4 did not swear to the truth in Exhibit '32'. The 
						crucial date remained unchanged and remained as 29th 
						January, 1989.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendant brought 
						down to Accra from London Rigby DW4 to assist the court. 
						He testified in court. On the crucial issue whether or 
						not he drove Dr. Ayeh Kumi to the residence of Dr. Blay 
						Miezah on 29th January, 1989 he was cross-examined on 
						Exhibit '31' as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Q. It would seem that 
						one thing you wanted to correct was the date Sunday 29th 
						January, 1989 which you had given in Exhibit '31'</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp; Yes. It is correct.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp; Otherwise you did 
						not attack&nbsp; the facts you had given in Exhibit '31'</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes apart from the 
						date.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The cross-examination 
						proved that apart from the date in Exhibit '31' every 
						statement of fact in exhibit '31' was the gospel truth. 
						Some only of the statements made in exhibit '31'&nbsp; are 
						the following:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1) &#8220;That was the only 
						occasion DW4 drove Dr. Ayeh Kumi to Dr. Blay Miezah's 
						residence at the request of Dr. Blay Miezah.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) That was the last 
						time DW4 saw Dr. Ayeh Kumi; and</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(3)&nbsp; That shortly after 
						this occasion Dr. Blay Miezah departed UK for Ghana,&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The more serious 
						statement made by DW4 was the following statement in 
						Exhibit &#8216;32&#8217;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Since making that 
						statement (Exhibit '31) I have learned that or Blay 
						Miezah departed&#8230;&#8230;.on 29th January 1989 which my memory 
						erroneously placed at 3rd February, 1989 ..............I 
						must point out that nowhere in exhibit '31' did DW4 
						state that Dr. Blay Miezah departed for Ghana on 3rd 
						February 1989. This was the statement DW43 made in 
						exhibit '31'.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;On the morning of 
						Sunday 29th January, 1989, I received a telephone 
						instruction from Dr. John Ackah Blay Miezah 
						.................I was further instructed to proceed 
						using my own car and accompanied by Nana Aryo Buah to 
						the home of Dr. Ayeh Kumi............. I drove my 
						passenger (Nana Buah and Dr. Ayeh Kumi to 60 Avenue 
						Road............ London&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the above evidence 
						DW4 had not corrected the date stated in Exhibit '31'. 
						The&nbsp; defendants witnesses, DWl, DW3 and DW4 evidence 
						that Dr. Ayeh Kumi was not present in the residence of 
						Dr. Blay Miezah was not worthy of credit. The trial 
						judge cannot be faulted for rejecting it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Nana Buah, PW1 stated 
						he was present in the house of Dr. Blay Miezah on 29th 
						January, 1989. In Exhibit '31' DW4 swore that on 29th 
						January, 1989 he drove Dr. Ayeh Kumi and Nana Buah PW1 
						to the residence of Dr. Blay Miezah. DW4, Rigby did not 
						retract the evidence that he drove PW1 to the residence 
						of Dr. Blay Miezah. PW3 Shenton stated he was the one 
						who drove PW1 and Dr. Ayeh Kumi on 29th January, 1989 to 
						the residence of Dr. Blay Miezah. PW1 stated that the 
						driver on that occasion was PW2, Rice. Rice testified 
						that he did not drive PW1 and Dr. Ayeh Kumi on that 
						date. PW2 claimed PW1 made a mistake about the name of 
						the person who drove him. In my view the evidence of the 
						identity and name of the driver is not crucial in 
						deciding whether or not Dr. Ayeh Kumi and PW1 were 
						driven in a car to the residence of Dr. Blay Miezah. The 
						evidence was that &quot;a white man&quot; drove them to the house 
						of Dr. Blay Miezah on that date.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There was evidence from 
						Kaku DW1 which I find helpful in considering this issue. 
						DW1 Kaku testified in part as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Any time Dr. Ayeh Kumi 
						was visiting Dr. Blay Miezeh, Nana would send his driver 
						to fetch him: DW1 did not stop there, he continued his 
						evidence as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Dr. Blay Miezah would 
						not send any of his security officer to fetch Dr. Ayeh 
						Kumi.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The evidence of DW4 was 
						thus corroborated by that of DW1, that is to say, that 
						Dr. Blay Miezah always provided Dr. Ayeh Kumi with 
						transportation when-ever, he Dr. Blay Miezeh needed the 
						presence and person of Dr. Ayeh Kumi in his residence. 
						The faulty recollection of witnesses in the 
						circumstances of this case can be reasonably understood. 
						In the light of the evidence before the court, I find 
						that PW4, Mrs. Pennington and Dr. Ayeh Kumi were each 
						present in the residence of Dr. Blay Miezeh on 29th 
						January 1989</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The other issue raised 
						by lawyer for defendants was the signature of Dr. Ayeh 
						Kumi on the testamentary document, dated 29th January, 
						1989. It was contended that this was foraged. That Dr. 
						Ayeh Kumi did not attest that document as a witness to 
						Dr. Blay Miezah's signature. I must refer to evidence on 
						this issue on record which was not adverted to by the 
						trial judge. The signature on the face of Exhibit '21' 
						was made on the 29th February, 1989. Before the trial 
						court was evidence of a signature of Dr. Ayeh Kumi made 
						by Dr. Ayeh Kumi on the 24th January, 1989 that is to 
						say, a signature Dr. Ayeh Kumi made some five days 
						earlier. I refer to Exhibit '46' which was put in 
						evidence by the defendants Exhibit '46' bears the 
						signature of Dr. Blay Miezah. I reproduce the relevant 
						portion of Exhibit '46' as follows:&#8212;</span></p>

						late Dr. Kwame Nkrumah.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There is no evidence as 
						to where Exhibit '46' was signed by both Dr. Blay Miezah 
						and Dr. Ayeh Kumi. In my view, this document, Exhibit 
						'46' has the effect of considerably watering down the 
						claim that Dr. Ayeh Kumi was incapable of signing his 
						name in January, 1989. This piece of evidence proved and 
						established that five days before the 1989 Will was 
						attested by Dr. Ayeh Kumi he had witnessed the signature 
						of Dr. Blay Miezah on Exhibit '46'. This piece of 
						evidence further established that Dr. Ayeh Kumi was 
						capable of making his signature on documents. This 
						evidence was supported and corroborated by evidence from 
						PW7, Miss Amartey who testified that Dr. Ayeh Kumi 
						signed his name on cheques up to date of his death. PW7 
						stated she lived with Dr. Ayeh Kumi in the same house 
						for several years till he died. This is not challenged.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There was also the 
						evidence of the two expert witnesses that the signature 
						on Exhibit '21' was made by Dr. Ayeh Kumi. I find that 
						the trial judge finding on this issue is supported by 
						the evidence on record. This court cannot disturb the 
						finding that Mrs. Pennington and Dr. Ayeh Kumi attested 
						the signature made by Dr. Blay Miezah in their presence 
						and in the presence of each of them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel for defendants 
						submitted that the trial judge erred in rejecting the 
						first and earlier reports of the handwriting experts in 
						preference of the second and subsequent reports put in 
						evidence by them. They submitted that the trial judge 
						erred in law, suo moto, in ordering the handwriting 
						experts to report on some documents selected by her. 
						They argued that she had no right to select those 
						documents and order the hand writing experts to report 
						on them. Counsel for plaintiffs submitted that the trial 
						judge was right in the view she took of the evidence 
						before her. That she had power to order that the 
						documents in evidence which she found relevant be 
						examined and reported upon by them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I find it necessary and 
						desirable to state the law on the evidence of an expert 
						witness. I&nbsp; find the case of Commey vs. Bentum-William 
						(1984-86) 2 GLR. 301 is helpful, At holding (1) appears 
						the statement:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(1) A handwriting 
						expert was not required to state definitely that a 
						particular writing was by a particular person. His 
						function was to point out similarities or differences in 
						two or more specimens of handwriting submitted to him 
						and leave the court to draw its own conclusion.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This holding was 
						extracted by Abban JA. (as he then was) from the English 
						case of Wakefield vs London (Bishop) (1921) 90 LJ 174 at 
						179 P.C. Abban J.A. stated the law correctly in the 
						following words at page 309 of the report.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;.............. in the

						would therefore have been an undue and unwarranted 
						interference of it (the report) had gone further to 
						pronounce on the very issue which the court was called 
						to determine.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The conclusions reached 
						by the handwriting experts on the signatures presented 
						to them are therefore not conclusive and decisive proof 
						of the matters in dispute. In the present appeal, the 
						conclusion reached by one of the hand writing experts, 
						was stated as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(1) In view of the

						co-ordination creating extreme variations and 
						inconsistency in both the handwriting and signatures 
						during the period between the late 1989, it is concluded 
						that all signatures representing Dr. Emmanuel Ayeh Kumi 
						on Exhibit 21, 28, H, J, K, L and Q were produced by one 
						and the same persons &quot;This was the substance of the 
						report of CW3 Yakubu. Then there was a report from CW2

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1)&nbsp; the alleged

						Will of 1988; Exhibit 'H'; Exhibit 'J'; and Exhibit 'Q' 
						were all signed by the same person.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The hand writing 
						experts explained in some great detail the factors and 
						matters they considered relevant and helpful in arriving 
						at their respective conclusions. The defendants enjoyed 
						an unfettered right to put in evidence reports of 
						experts or their choice to prove and establish their 
						case of forgery. They did not exercise this right. They 
						did not offer any explanation for not doing so. The 
						opinion evidence of the two experts was accepted by the 
						trial judge. I have not found evidence on record which 
						even remotely demonstrate that the finding of the trial 
						judge cannot be supported. The issue that Dr. Ayeh Kumi 
						did not in his last days enjoy good health was proved 
						and established by unchallenged evidence. That the 
						condition of his health affected his ability to write 
						was not disputed. Five days earlier he had signed a 
						document. In all the circumstances the finding by the 
						trial judge that Dr. Ayeh Kumi made the signature on the 
						1989 Will was supportable by evidence before her.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is trite learning 
						that findings of fact made by a trial judge must not be 
						disturbed except in special circumstances. See on this 
						Darkwah vs. Denteh (1972) 2 GLR 305 C.A. and Appiah vs. 
						Takyi (1982-83) 1 GLR 1 C.A. In the recent Supreme Court 
						case entitled Barclays Bank (Ghana) Ltd. vs. Sakari 
						(1996-97) SCRIR 639 the court held at holding (3) as 
						follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(3) An appellate 
						court, like the Supreme Court could not set aside 
						findings of fact where they were based on the demeanour 
						of witnesses. But where the findings were based on 
						undisputed facts and documents, as in the instant case, 
						the appellate court was in decidedly the same position 
						as the lower court, and could examine those facts and 
						materials to see whether the lower court's findings were 
						justified in terms of the relevant legal decision an 
						principles&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This statement of the

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instant case 
						counsel challenged the power and the right of the trial 
						judge to refer, suo moto, some of the documentary 
						exhibits for examination and classification. Counsel did 
						not cite any law or rule which prohibited a trial judge 
						from exercising that power and right. I am not aware of 
						any law or rule that denied to a trial judge such power 
						and right. In this case, the documents were put in 
						evidence to enable the trial judge examine, evaluate and 
						determine what weight evidentially speaking, to attach 
						to each and every one of them. In my view, if the trial 
						judge reasonably and fairly believed that due to the 
						technical or special attribute or nature of the evidence 
						to be so considered she needed the opinion of an expert 
						witness in the particular discipline, the ends of 
						justice enjoined the trial judge to elicit the opinion 
						she needed. I think the mere exercise of the power and 
						right cannot be called in question. However, I am of the 
						view that in a case where the power and right were 
						exercised capriciously and oppressively to the 
						disadvantage of a party, the exercise of the power and 
						right must be impeached. In the instant case, the 
						defendants have not pointed to evidence to support and 
						establish the complaint that the reference, suo moto, by 
						the trial judge of the selected documentary exhibits was 
						unjustifiable, capricious and prejudicial to their case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						retrieved. In the said 1988 Will the deceased appointed 
						the 1st defendant the sole executor thereof. A codicil 
						to the 1988 Will was made on 16th August 1990. And so 
						too was a nuncupative Will made by the same deceased 
						person on 9th June 1992. They averred that they have 
						deposited all these testamentary instruments in court 
						and that the High Court has accepted them. It was their 
						contention that even if the 1989 Will was made which in 
						effect revoked the 1988 Will, yet since both the codicil 
						of 1990 and nuncupative Will of 1992 made reference to 
						the 1988 Will, the latter was revived. Accordingly the 
						defendants counter claimed for this basic relief that 
						the court should grant the 1st and 2nd defendants 
						probate of the 1988 will together with the 1990 codicil 
						and the 1992 nuncupative will</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">However, at the summons 
						for directions, the court rejected portions of the 
						defence and counter claim. Of immense significance, the 
						court in its ruling of 18th May, 1995, rejected all the 
						averments that dealt with the questions relating to the 
						1988 Will, 1990 codicil and 1992 nuncupative will as 
						irrelevant. The court's reason being that by the terms 
						of the order of the High Court presided over by 
						Akoto-Bamfo (Mrs.) J. (as she then was), the plaintiffs 
						were only ordered to issue a writ to determine whether 
						or not the 1989 Will was a forgery, so the parties were 
						bound by the terms of that order. In that same ruling 
						the court upheld the plaintiffs and the 1st plaintiffs 
						attorney's capacity in this action.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">With those decisions 
						against which no appeal was lodged, I would have thought 
						that all the parties, as well as the Lawyers and the 
						Court, had agreed to confine themselves to the validity 
						of the 1989 Will only. But as it turned out, the volumes 
						of evidence led took several other unrelated matters 
						into consideration. No doubt the Lawyers, and to some 
						extent the trial Judge herself, lost track of the only 
						issue open on the writ and the pleadings after the 
						ruling of May 18, 1995, and which was whether the 1989 
						Will was valid in the sense as known to the law. Counsel 
						pushed in, and the Court accepted, the other 
						testamentary documents, the very thing that had been 
						rightly rejected at the summons for directions. Going 
						through the remainder of the pleadings as they stood 
						after the court's ruling of 18th&nbsp; May, 1995, I 'm not 
						too surprised at the turn of events because para. 14 of 
						the statement of defence of the defendants was allowed 
						to stand, for what reason I do not know. That averment 
						reads: The defendants will contend that the late Dr, 
						Ackah Blay Miezah in his codicil dated the 16th August 
						1990 and nuncupative Will of the 9th June, 1992 
						specifically made reference to his Will of 8th&nbsp; May, 
						1988 which he had deposited in UBS and UOB in 
						Switzerland whereas there was no mention whatsoever of 
						the 29th January 1989 Will.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">With this averment 
						still intact, it made possible for Counsel for the 
						defendants to introduce those documents without 
						objection for their full force and effect. The trial 
						court then cannot be faulted for stating an opinion on 
						those documents in the light of the evidence before it. 
						But by that approach, the area of conflict rather than 
						being narrowed, was considerably widened. What then is 
						the effect of the decision/s taken in respect of these 
						testamentary documents? Any decision taken thereon would 
						give rise to what Diplock 1 J. decribed as an &quot;issue 
						estoppel&quot; in the case of THODAY VS. THODAY (1964) P. 181 
						at p. 198. This principle has since then been fully 
						embraced as a correct principle of law. It was further 
						given an exposition by Lord Denying, M.R. in the case of 
						FIDELITAS SHIPPING CO., LTD. VS. V/O EXPORT CHLEB (1965) 
						2 ALL ER 4 at pp. 8&#8211;9 where the learned judge said:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The law, as I 
						understand it, if this: if one party brings an action 
						against another for a particular cause and judgment is 
						given on it, there is a strict rule of law that he 
						cannot bring another action against the same party for 
						the same cause...........But within the cause of action, 
						there may be several issues raised which are necessary 
						for the determination of the whole case. The rule then 
						is that, once as issue has been raised and distinctly 
						determined between the parties, then as a general rule, 
						neither party can be allowed to fight that issue all 
						over again. The same issue cannot be raised by either of 
						them again in the same or subsequent proceedings except 
						in special circumstances, .........................&#8221;. 
						See these cases: CARL-ZEISS-STIFTUNG VS. RAYNER AND 
						KEELER, LTD. (No. 2) (1966) 2 ALL ER. 536 at p. 565 per 
						Lord Guest; BEDU and Others VS AGBI and Other (1972) 2 
						GLR 238 C.A. Thus is the determination of these 
						documents was necessary in determining the only issue 
						before the court, that determination would create an 
						issue estoppel against whoever lost it; if not, then it 
						could be used in matters of credibility only, if 
						necessary.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">From the record, part 
						of the evidence was taken in Accra and part in London. 
						Whilst attacking the totality of the judgment as being 
						against the weight of evidence, among several grounds of 
						appeal, the appellants appear to be particularly bitter 
						about the proceedings in London which they have attacked 
						as totally wrong in law and/or practice. Before the 
						court moved to London it had taken evidence from a 
						number of the plaintiffs&#8217; witnesses. And further 
						evidence was taken after the London trip. Thus besides 
						the London evidence, there was other evidence led. So 
						any meaningful decision in this appeal would have to 
						address the question whether, without what I have chosen 
						to call the London evidence, there was sufficient 
						evidence on the record to support the trial court's 
						conclusion, assuming the London evidence was wrongly 
						received in law or practice. I propose therefore to deal 
						with this appeal from three fronts, namely (1) the Accra 
						evidence only, (2) the London evidence only; and (3) a 
						combination of both evidence, if necessary. This 
						approach is in conformity with the requirements of 
						section 5(1) (2) of the Evidence Decree, 1975 (N.R.C.D. 
						323) which has these provisions:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) In determining 
						whether an erroneous admission of evidence resulted in a

						consider&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						court relied on that inadmissible evidence; and</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) whether an 
						objection to or a motion to exclude or to strike out the

						stage in the action; and</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) whether the

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(e) whether the 
						decision would have been otherwise but for that 
						erroneous admission of evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I begin then with the 
						Accra evidence. The 1st plaintiff&nbsp; testified about the 
						1989 Will. The relevant part of her testimony was what 
						she personally knew about this matter. She said the 
						deceased himself told her about a Will he had made. This 
						is what she said:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Dr. Blay 
						Miezah&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..told me that Dr. Kells was holding 
						everything concerning the Oman Ghana Trust. In short if 
						something happened to him, Dr. Kells was the only one 
						who was holding the will for the Trust. I was in Dr. 
						Blay Miezah's bedroom at Abelenkpe in Accra when the 
						above incident took place&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.After Dr. Blay Miezah's 
						death the will was still with Dr. Kells in 
						London................ Dr. Kells informed the Trustees 
						that he had the will.&quot; From the xxx of the 1st plaintiff 
						s attorney, it is clear the defence lawyers were more 
						interested in attacking her credibility as against the 
						substance of what she had said. She was an ex-fiance of 
						the deceased, and Counsel sought to portray her as an 
						insincere, unfaithful, crooked person who was sacked by 
						the deceased and so could not and should not be believed 
						by the court. That approach, it appear, did not find 
						favour with the trial court. It was through this witness 
						that a lot of the defendants' exhibits were put in 
						evidence, including an affidavit sworn to by Miss or 
						Mrs. Pennington, one of the attesting witnesses to the 
						1989 will. Miss or Mrs. Pennington is one and the same 
						person. I found it hard to reconcile the defendants' 
						position, as put across in the xx of the 1st plaintiffs 
						that both Dr. Kells and Mrs. Pennington were not present 
						in the deceased's residence in London on the day the 
						will was said to have been made, and their decision to 
						tender the same Mrs. Pennington's affidavit-exhibit 9 in 
						which she had made it clear who were there that day, 
						inter alia. I shall return to this exhibit later on. The 
						first witness for the plaintiffs was one Nana Arvo Buah, 
						(Pw1). His relevant testimony was that on 29 January 
						1989 he picked Dr. Ayeh Kumi and Mr. Rice from the 
						former's house and took them to the deceased's house in 
						London. Later he sent Dr. Ayeh Kumi back to this house.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The next witness was 
						Thomas Shenton, a consultant who worked for the deceased 
						in London. He said on 29th January 1989, he was sent by 
						the deceased to go and pick Dr. Ayeh Kumi from his 
						house. When he got there pw1 arrived in his own car so 
						the three of them went to the deceased's residence. He 
						said he had seen Dr. Ayeh Kumi sign his signature before 
						and had also seen it on some documents prior to the 
						hearing, so he identified it on the will-exhibit 21. 
						Under xx he denied a suggestion that he did not see pw1, 
						Dr. Kells and Mrs. Pennington in the deceased's house 
						that day.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Mr. Rice, also a 
						security personnel working for the deceased, testified 
						as pw3. He confirmed that it was pwl and pw2 who brought 
						Dr. Ayeh Kumi to the deceased's house that day. He said 
						he met Mrs. Pennington in London but she was unwilling 
						to travel to Ghana to testify in this case for several 
						reasons, that I may talk about later. She told him she 
						had left her written statement with the Ghana High 
						Commission in London so he should pick it and bring it 
						to the court in Ghana and he obliged. That document 
						happened to be an affidavit of what she knew about this 
						case. It was objected to when it was sought to be 
						tendered but the court overruled the objection and 
						admitted it in evidence as exhibit E. This exhibit is, 
						in content, similar to exhibit 9 that the defendants had 
						earlier put in evidence so I consider it odd for them to 
						seek to reject this one.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">From the record the 
						next witness for the plaintiffs whose evidence was taken 
						in Accra was Alhaji Bukari, a forensic expert with the 
						Ghana Police. He said in March, 1994 he was asked by one 
						Gregg Frazier to examine some documents to find out 
						whether the signatures thereon were produced by on 
						Emmanuel Ayeh Kumi. These were a passport, an indenture 
						dated 5/10/50 and a will of the deceased. After he had 
						completed the work, the documents were collected from 
						him by Gregg Frazier and that it was the applicant, that 
						is Frazier who told him &quot;which of the signatures were 
						authentic.&quot; He tendered his report in evidence as 
						exhibit G. According to the witness Frazier brought the 
						originals of all these documents to them for the 
						examination. He went on to say that &quot;a person's 
						signature may change as a result of something that may 
						happen to him, for example age, fatigue, illness and the 
						material on which he is writing itself ............. If 
						you compare signatures of say 40 years is more likely to 
						show greater change in the signature.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The next witness was 
						the wife of the late Dr. Ayeh Kumi who testified as pw7. 
						Her evidence concerned mainly the health situation of 
						her late husband especially towards the evening of his 
						life. The foregoing, in brief, represents the evidence 
						led by the plaintiffs. Before I go to the defence case, 
						let me consider at this state the evidence of those 
						persons who testified as court witnesses. The first of 
						these was a district registrar, called Simon Sonu, 
						attached to the Accra High Court. He was asked to 
						produce the 1989 will, but when he first took the 
						witness stand on 5/7/95 he said it was not available for 
						stated reasons. He admitted under xx that all four wills 
						were deposited with the court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The next court witness 
						was one John Albert Owusu, a documents examiner, who was 
						asked to examine certain documents germane to the case, 
						namely the 1989 will, the passport, the original as well 
						as a photocopy of the 1989 will. His conclusion was that 
						they were all made by Dr. Ayeh Kumi and the deceased. 
						There was another Court witness being the court 
						registrar but his evidence has no bearing on a 
						determination of issuers at stake. Pw6 returned to take 
						the witness stand, not on a re-call, but as a court 
						witness to testify about other aspects of the case but 
						still in his capacity as a forensic expert. This time it 
						was his boss who referred certain documents to him to 
						examine in June, 1996. These included the will of 1989 
						(exhibit 21), the two copies of the 1989 will (exhibit 
						28 and O), and the passport (exhibit 22) and he was to 
						determine whether they were made by Dr. Ayeh Kumi and 
						his conclusion was that &quot; all the four documents were 
						definitely without the slightest doubt produced by one 
						and the same person.&quot; But under xx the witness said 
						exhibit 21 could be a forgery but was positive that 
						exhibit 28 was a complete forgery.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">From the totality of 
						the evidence as recounted above, the following points 
						stand out:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1) the deceased 
						himself in his lifetime told the 1st plaintiffs attorney 
						that he had left his will with Dr. Kells, and from the 
						evidence the only will that was left with him was the 
						1989 will. This lady, apart from being an attorney from 
						the 1st plaintiff, was a competent witness in her own 
						right. This is borne out of the fact that by exhibit A, 
						she was interested in the funds at the disposal of the 
						deceased, so she was a person who had the right to know. 
						Thus her testimony that the deceased told her about who 
						was going to administer the funds after him was 
						creditworthy. Exhibit A is dated 20th August, 1991 long 
						after the 1989 Will had been made. It is addressed to 
						1st plaintiff&#8217;s attorney in her own name. The relevant 
						parts read: &#8220;I invited you from Germany to confirm 
						irrevocably that before the demise of your loving 
						brother, the late Hon. Kwasi Amoako Atta, I was 
						instructed to pay to you from his estate an amount of 
						$15,000,000.00 (fifteen million US dollars)&#8230;&#8230;now his 
						estate is classified as Amoaku Atta Foundation within 
						the Oman Ghana Fund which I, the undersigned, is (sic) 
						the sole beneficiary and trustee.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We will be meeting in 
						Brussels shortly and you are hereby invited to sit with 
						us at the bank for payment of the $15&#8230;&#8230;Million US 
						dollars&#8230;&#8230;..to any account you will designate.&#8221; Her 
						evidence was thus important and it confirms that the 
						deceased had made a will in favour of Dr. Kells and from 
						the record the 1989 will was the only one that meets the 
						description. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2)&nbsp; From the testimony 
						of pws l, 2 and 3, Dr. Ayeh Kumi was in the house of the 
						deceased that day having been sent for by the deceased 
						himself.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(3)&nbsp; By exhibit C dated 
						29/6/90 written by the deceased and addressed to Dr. 
						Kells, he made it clear that the other attesting witness 
						Mrs. Pennington as well as Dr. Kells were present in his 
						London home on 29/1/89, the day the 1989 will was said 
						to have been made and executed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(4) There is evidence 
						from pw2 that the signature on the will-exhibit D-is 
						that of Dr. Ayeh Kumi, whose signature he was familiar 
						with. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(5) There is acceptable 
						evidence, in the absence of any serious dispute, that 
						the deceased signed this will. The defendants sought to 
						say that it was a blank letter head signed by the 
						deceased that the plaintiffs lay hands on to fill in the 
						details. I&#8217;ll talk about this when I come to consider 
						the defence case. But for the plaintiffs' purpose it 
						suffices that the signature on the will was that of the 
						deceased.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(6) Despite the 
						confusion that pw6 who also testified later as a court 
						witness created by his inconsistent report and evidence 
						there was this acceptable evidence by the other forensic 
						expert Mr. Owusu that both the deceased and Dr. Ayeh 
						Kumi signed this 1989 will. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(7) Nana Arvo Buah 
						(pw1) said that day he was driving Dr. Ayeh Kumi home 
						and they were conversing on the way. In the course of 
						the conversation Dr. Ayeh Kumi said he was expecting him 
						(pwl) to take over from the deceased but he&#8212;the 
						deceased&#8212;had given all power to Dr. Kells, and he went 
						on to show him his copy of the will made by the 
						deceased. He spoke about his reaction but that is not 
						necessary. The relevance of this testimony was that one 
						of the attesting witnesses told him what the will 
						contained and even went on to show him the copy that was 
						with him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(8) Counsel for the 
						defendants introduced into evidence an affidavit made by 
						Mrs. Pennington in support of the application for 
						probate of this very will.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Under the rules namely, 
						Order 2 rule 1 and Order 6, rule 7 of the probate and 
						Administration Rules, 1991 (L.I 1515), such affidavits 
						are acceptable in support of due execution of a will. 
						Therefore in any subsequent proceeding in respect of 
						that will such an affidavit is admissible. If it is put 
						in by the proponent of the will, the other side can 
						insist on cross-examining the deponent, under order 38 
						rule 29 of the High Court (Civil Procedure), Rules, 1954 
						(L.N. 140A). But where, as in this case, it was tendered 
						by the other side the court is bound to give due 
						consideration to it, being the defendants' own exhibit. 
						In this exhibit, the deponent said she was present with 
						the deceased and Dr. Ayeh Kumi when the deceased signed 
						the will in the presence of both of them and the two of 
						them also signed in his presence. This affidavit 
						confirms the various pieces of evidence itemised 1-7 
						(supre). If the defendants really wanted to 
						cross-examine the deponent they should not have tendered 
						it themselves, an affidavit that had been sued in 
						previous proceedings between the parties and they had 
						thus become aware of what it contained. At that point in 
						the proceedings, I wonder why the plaintiffs' Counsel 
						put the estate to all those expenses in travelling to 
						London to receive from Mrs. Pennington the very evidence 
						that Counsel for the defendants had so graciously put in 
						evidence without any cost whatsoever. Exhibit E was also 
						a mere surplusagge since it is a literal recapitulation 
						of exhibit 9, which for its full force and effect, I 
						reproduce here:</span></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;I, MRS. EDDA ANGELINA 
						PENNINGTON of 7 Upper Wimpole St. London W1M 7TD, nurse, 
						make oath and say as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1.&nbsp; I am the second of 
						the subscribing witnesses to the late will and testament 
						dated 29th&nbsp; January, 1989 of the above named Dr. John 
						Ackah Blay Miezah, otherwise called Kolorah Blay or Nana 
						Ackah Nyanzu 11 or Linna Disca deceased.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2.&nbsp; The said Testator 
						executed the said will on the day of the date thereof by 
						signing the name at the foot thereof, as the same now 
						appears thereon, in the presence of myself and of Dr. 
						Emmanuel Ayeh Kumi, Company Director, the other and 
						first subscribed witness thereto, who regrettably died 
						on the 7th day of October 1989.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3.&nbsp; At the same time 
						when the said Testator signed the said Will in manner 
						aforesaid, both the said Dr Emmanuel Ayeh Kumi (since 
						deceased ) and I were present at the same time, and we 
						thereupon attested and subscribed to the said Will in 
						the presence of him the said Testator.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">With the foregoing, it 
						was clear the plaintiffs had satisfied due execution, 
						albeit prima facie. With the signatures duly proved and 
						that the testator signed in the presence of the 
						witnesses and vice versa, the requirements of the law 
						were duly satisfied. The burden was accordingly shifted 
						to the defence to prove that the signature were forged, 
						and/or to lead rebuttal evidence to show that the 
						signatories did not in fact sign it. The law is that 
						when it is alleged that signatures to a deed are forged 
						the onus of proof is on the party alleging the forgery 
						and must be strictly discharged, see QUARM VS. YANKAH II 
						and 1 Other 1930) 1 W.A.C.A. 80. Also, it is the duty of 
						those who propound a will to remove any suspicion and to 
						approve affirmatively that the testator knew and 
						approved the contents. When this is done the onus is 
						thrown on those who oppose the will to prove forgery or 
						whatever else they rely on to displace the case made for 
						proving the will. See TYRELL VS. RAINTON (1894) P. 151 
						at p. 157 C.A.&nbsp; per Lindley L.J. There was the point 
						about the standard of proof required in forgery. 
						According to counsel for the plaintiffs it was proof 
						beyond reasonable doubt by virtue of section 13(1) of 
						the Evidence Decree, 1975 (N.R.C.D 323) but the view of 
						defence counsel and the trial court was that in civil 
						matters the standard of proof in all civil cases was by 
						preponderance of probabilities. The Supreme Court has 
						held that by virtue of sections 11 (4) and 12 of the 
						Evidence Decree the standard of proof in all civil cases 
						was proof by preponderance of probabilities-no 
						exceptions were made. His Lordships' opinion, no doubt, 
						was in reference to where the issue to be established 
						was purely civil in character, for example, like the 
						case before them, a declaration of title to land. That 
						decision did not discuss s. 13 since there was no need 
						for it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Section 13(1) of the 
						Evidence Decree provides: &quot;In any civil or criminal 
						action the burden of persuasion as to the commission by 
						a party of a crime which is directly in issue requires 
						proof beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; This provides an 
						exception under s.12(1) of the Evidence Decree, which 
						reads: 'Except as otherwise provided by law, the burden 
						of persuasion requires proof by a preponderance of the 
						probabilities.' (The emphasis is mine.) The statute 
						recognizes that there are certain situations in a civil 
						trial where the standard of proof will have to be 
						upgraded to a higher pedestal than is otherwise the case 
						in order to cast a heavier burden on the party alleging 
						or imputing criminal conduct or activity to his 
						opponent. The rational for this requirement of proof 
						beyond reasonable doubt even in a civil trial is 
						provided in the Commentary to the Evidence Decree at 
						page 16 in these words: &#8220;....on a balance it is felt 
						that where the commission of a crime is at issue the 
						consequences on the reputation and life of the person 
						alleged to have committed the crime are so great that 
						the standard of proof applied in criminal actions to 
						protect those who are accused should equally apply in 
						civil actions. Let me turn to what the trial court 
						decided on this issued. The court referred to certain 
						English opinions especially that of Lord Denning LJ in 
						MILLER VS. MINISTER OF PENSIONS (1947) 2 ER 372 at pp 
						373-374 that in a civil case the court does not require 
						proof beyond reasonable doubt even when it is 
						considering a charge of a criminal nature. With respect 
						to the trial judge I think she erred in this, because 
						our legislation is completely at variance with the 
						English so there was no justification for reliance on 
						English authorities on this subject which I believe led 
						her into that error.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Under the legislation, 
						a court has to be satisfied that the particular issue or 
						question raised is criminal in character, especially in 
						relation to the act complained of; if it is, it has to 
						apply the criminal standard or proof under s. 13(1). So 
						the next obvious question is whether 'forgery' is 
						criminal. I do not believe it can be dispute that 
						forging a will is in the nature of a crime especially if 
						intent to defraud exists. See the case of R. V. MENSAH 
						(1959)G.L.R. 314 C.A. The ordinary dictionary meaning of 
						forgery as found in Oxford Advanced Learners dictionary 
						is this: 'crime or act of forging a document, picture, 
						signature etc.' In English law forgery is criminal and 
						as was decided in the very old case of R V. PARKES &amp; 
						BROWN (1797), 2 LEACH 775, forgery is the false making 
						of a note or other instrument with intent to defraud. 
						The essence of forgery is that a person forges a false 
						document to make it appear a genuine document. See these 
						cases: R V. SMITH (1858), DEARS &amp; B. 566, C.C.R; R V. 
						RITSON (1869), L.R. 1 C.C.R. 200. In my view forgery in 
						relation to somebody's will is criminal conduct, for 
						unless the forger intended to defraud the real 
						beneficiaries, there would be no point in deliberately 
						forging the will. Thus the issue of forgery raised in 
						this case ought to have been proved beyond reasonable 
						doubt. But even then the lower standard of proof on a 
						preponderance of probabilities could not be met by the 
						defence as found by the trial court as I shall shortly 
						unfold. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendants from 
						their pleadings, appeared to be blowing hot and cold. 
						Whilst rejecting the 1989 will, they also appear to be 
						admitting it, subject, however, to proof that the 
						persons named as being present were actually present. 
						This is from para. 8 of their defence whereby they 
						denied para 6 of the statement of claim and put the 
						plaintiffs to strict proof thereof. The said para. 6 of 
						the statement of claim reads: &quot;All the defendants assert 
						that the said 1989 will is a forged Will. The 
						plaintiffs, however contend that the said 1989 will was 
						made by the said testator at his residence at 6 Avenue 
						Road, St. John's Wood London NW. 8 in the presence of 
						the following persons, namely&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;it goes onto list the 
						names. (The emphasis is mine). The defendants are 
						denying the plaintiffs' averment that they&#8212;the 
						defendants are saying the 1989 will is a forgery. If the 
						defendants are not claiming the 1989 will is a forgery, 
						then what were they fighting about? Nonetheless taking 
						the totality of their pleadings into account I am able 
						to say this was an admission made by mistake for it is 
						clearly inconsistent with the rest of their pleadings 
						and they are entitled to be heard whilst they take steps 
						to amend it. For by the rule in HOLLIS VS. BURTON (1892) 
						3 CH 226, a party who has unwarily made an admission 
						will be allowed to withdraw or recall it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1. The totality of all 
						four defendants' case was based on these facts: that the 
						deceased did not make the will, the reason being that 
						the 1990 codicil and the 1992 nuncupative will both made 
						reference to the 1988 and not any other will. The other 
						reason is that the deceased was in the habit of signing 
						blank letter heads so the plaintiffs must have got hold 
						of one such letter head and typed the will on it. 
						Another reason is that the deceased, Dr. Ayeh Kumi, and 
						Mrs. Pennington did not meet at all that day. Yet 
						another reason they gave was that the deceased could not 
						have made a will giving all his assets to a stranger to 
						the total neglect of his family.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2.&nbsp; The signature of 
						Dr. Ayeh Kumi is a forgery.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3.&nbsp; The plaintiffs 
						presented another forged will dated 15/6/92, executed 
						after the death of Dr. Blay Miezah.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">4.&nbsp; There were such 
						contradictions in the plaintiffs' case that ought to 
						have led the court to reject their case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">5.&nbsp; The trial judge was 
						biased against the defendants </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I'll take these 
						seriatim. These are, to a large extent, summed up in the 
						evidence of the 1st&nbsp; defendant under xx as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Q.&nbsp; Were you with Blay 
						Miezah on 29/21/89? </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp; No, I was not.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp; Why do you, 
						therefore, say that the will was a forgery?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A. I was not there with 
						him, but it had been read to me and the circumstances 
						surrounding it from my knowledge of the facts I know, 
						convince me that it's a forgery. Certainly, Ayeh Kumi's 
						signature is a forgery. Secondly, to my knowledge, 
						during the lifetime of Dr. Ackah Blay Miezah, he had 
						signed letterheads on which he had signed his name and 
						some of his friends had copies. Because of my sight I 
						could not verify Ayeh Kumi's signature myself, but other 
						people did.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp; Who are those 
						people who verifies the signature for you?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A. 3rd and 4th 
						defendants, who are Blay Miezah's children, they knew 
						Ayeh Kumi's signature. Moreover, my colleague, lawyer 
						Kojo Erskine had verified it and he knew the signature 
						of Ayeh Kumi.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp; What are the other 
						circumstances, apart from knowledge of 3rd and 4th 
						defendants and Lawyer Erskine, that caused you to 
						believe that the will was forged?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A. &nbsp;(1)&nbsp; I have a view 
						that one of Blay Miezah&#8217;s signed letterheads must have 
						fallen into Dr. John Kell&#8217;s hand and must have been used 
						to forge the will.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) To my knowledge Dr. 
						John Kells was not a friend of Blay Miezah, apart from 
						my knowledge that Dr. Kells was teaching him these 
						Chinese exercises, so I found it very difficult that, a 
						shrewd businessman would have put into the 1989 will Dr. 
						Kells as his heir and executor.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(3) I found it very 
						difficult to believe that a shrewd man like Ackah Blay 
						Miezah would leave all his estate to Dr. John Kells to 
						the exclusion of his own brother, Kwesi Whajah and even 
						his own children. I cannot believe that Blay Miezah 
						could have said what was written in the 1989 will.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(4) I find it very 
						difficult that Kwesi Whajah himself could believe that 
						his brother left all his estate to John Kells, an 
						Irishman.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp; So on the basis of 
						these views you concluded that exhibit 21 was a forgery?
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp; Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Earlier on I quote para 
						14 of the defendants&#8217; statement of defence whereby they 
						averred that the deceased did not make this will because 
						he made no reference to it in his codicil of 1990 and 
						nuncupative will of 1992. The defence position on this 
						is summed up in the words of the 2nd defendant Kaku 
						Mensah when in his evidence-in-chief he said: &#8220;since 
						there was a codicil mentioning the 1988 will, the same 
						person could not have written a will of this nature.&#8221; I 
						don&#8217;t think I need waste time on this sort of reasoning 
						of argument, for it is simply &#8216;non sequitur&#8217;. The fact 
						that no mention was made in the codicil and nuncupative 
						will to the 1989 will did not mean it did not exist. The 
						reason why it was not mentioned in these other 
						documents, if at all they exist, was known to only the 
						deceased. Nobody is entitled to conjecture or speculate 
						reasons why he did that. And whatever might have been 
						the reasons, the important consideration is that it has 
						nothing to do with the existence or validity of the 1989 
						will.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Next, it was said the 
						deceased was in the habit of signing blank letter beads, 
						one of which the plaintiffs might have laid hands on and 
						typed in the will. The fact that the deceased signed 
						blank letter heads is not sufficient reason to conclude 
						that the l989 will was a forgery. If such a conclusion 
						is accepted the same reason could be assigned for every 
						document on which the deceased's signature appears. It 
						must be established positively that in fact the paper on 
						which the will was typed was a blank sheet previously 
						signed by the deceased that the plaintiffs laid hands on 
						to type in the will. That will be the best and only 
						acceptable evidence in the circumstances where the 
						burden of persuasion on the issue of forgery rests with 
						the defence. They do not prove it by speculation as to 
						what the plaintiffs might have possibly done, but what 
						they did as a matter of fact or at least on a balance of 
						probabilities. There is no evidence any of the 
						plaintiffs or their agents ever got hold of any such 
						blank but signed letter head, or that anybody saw or 
						even heard that any of the plaintiffs had caused this 
						will to be made. I think it's based on mere suspicion 
						which is not sufficient to prove forgery. The point 
						raised totally fails. The only probative value of this 
						point is that it confirms the defence do not reject the 
						signature on it to be that of the deceased, they only 
						deny that he signed it as a will.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The next point raised 
						was that the deceased would never have given his wealth 
						to a stranger to the total exclusion of his family. Let 
						me refer to what the 2nd defendant said on this : &quot;I 
						have with me a copy of the 1989 will. Knowing my cousin 
						very well and the confidence he had in me. Knowing him, 
						he could not have left everything he had to a Whiteman.&quot; 
						And under xx he was asked; &quot;You came to the conclusion 
						that Exhibit 21 was forged because you thought that by 
						Exhibit 21, Blay Miezah had given all his worldly 
						possessions to a whiteman.&quot; And his answer was this: &quot;I 
						said I knew my cousin very well and he could not made 
						such a will for a whiteman.&quot; From the record the 
						deceased knew Dr. Kells very well. But even if he did 
						not know him, was it a sufficient reason to conclude 
						that the will was a forgery? Certainly not. If a 
						testator gives away all his property to a total 
						stranger, it may only arouse suspicion, but if due 
						execution in accordance with law is proved, and that the 
						testator was of sound mind and executed it freely, the 
						court will have to give effect to his wishes regardless 
						of who the beneficiaries are. If any person believes he 
						is entitled to be catered for by the testator but was 
						left out, the law permits such a person to go to court, 
						not to have the will declared void but, for a share of 
						the inheritance. In effect the court is not interested 
						in the reasons why a testator made particular devices 
						the way he did, nor is a testator bound to assign 
						reasons for making any devices in his will. Some people 
						give the reasons but as I have just said it is not 
						obligatory, not being a requirement of the law. In the 
						case of IN RE AYAYEE (DECD); KUKUBOR and ANOTHER VS. 
						AYAYEE (1982-83) PT II GLR 866, the High Court presided 
						over by Cecilia Koranteng-Addow J. relying on the 
						English case of BANS VS. GOODFELLOW (1879) L.R. 5 Q.B. 
						549 said : &quot;A testator has an unfettered discretion to 
						dispose of his property as he chooses. The discretion 
						may sometimes be influenced by passion, caprice, the 
						power of new association or ties, or sinister influence 
						to the extent of excluding persons whom the law imposes 
						legal obligations on the testator to make provision for. 
						There are occasions too when the instinct and affections 
						and sentiments of mankind may safely lead one to make 
						better disposition on one's estate than a distribution 
						obtained through the stereotyped rules of a general law 
						.........&#8221;I hold this is no good reason for declaring a 
						will a forgery.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A point forcefully 
						canvassed against the execution of this will was that on 
						29/1/89 when the will was said to have been made and 
						executed, these persons namely, Dr. Kells, Dr. Ayeh 
						Kumi, Mrs. Pennington and Nana Arvo Buah did not come to 
						the deceased's house in London at all, and so could not 
						have signed or witnessed the will. This was the evidence 
						of James Kaku as well as Chang Han Kim and Peter Rigby 
						and it is not in dispute that all three of them were in 
						the house at one time or the other that day. It is also 
						not in dispute that Rice and Shenton both of who 
						testified for the plaintiffs were also in the house that 
						day. So either group of persons must certainly be lying 
						to the court. The man at the centre of all this 
						controversy, Dr. Ackah Blay Miezah, however, provides a 
						clear clue as to which group was lying. In his lifetime 
						the deceased wrote a letter dated 29th June, 1990 to Dr. 
						Kells and this was put in evidence as exhibit C which I 
						quote in extensor. It reads: &quot;RE: RELEASE OF SEALLS AND 
						DOCUMENT&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">About two months ago I

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This was the same James 
						Kaku who told the court Dr. Kells and Mrs. Pennington 
						never came to the house that day. This same witness said 
						they, that is he and the deceased, remained at home that 
						day prior to their departure to Ghana and he fed the 
						deceased with both breakfast and lunch at home. Where 
						then did the deceased give the sealed envelope to Dr. 
						Kells in the presence of he James Kaku and Mrs. 
						Pennington? Certainly it was in the deceased's house 
						since he did not go out apart from leaving for the 
						airport that evening. This exhibit clearly confirms the 
						plaintiffs version and portrays the others as 
						untruthful. The trial court was thus justified in 
						rejecting the defence and concluding that all these 
						persons were there with the deceased that day. This 
						exhibit also confirms the rather close relationship that 
						existed between the deceased and Dr. Kells. In the end 
						of the defence failed to satisfy the court that the 
						deceased did not sign the 1989 will exhibit 21.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The next line of attack 
						is the signature of Ayeh Kumi, which was waged from two 
						fronts, namely (a) that he did not go to the deceased's 
						house at all the day; (b) the signature on the exhibit 
						21 that purports to be his was not signed by him or was 
						not his true signature. I'll take them in that order. I 
						have already referred to the evidence of pwl that he 
						brought Dr. Ayeh kumi to the deceased's house that day 
						in the company of Rice. The person he called Rice was 
						identified by both Rice and Shenton (pw2) to be actually 
						Shenton. Pw2 testified that it was the decease who sent 
						him to go and fetch Dr. Ayeh Kumi and whilst he was in 
						Ayeh Kumi's house pwl came there and pick them in his 
						car to the deceased's house. As to the description of 
						himself (pw2) as Rice by pwl, Shenton (pw2) explained it 
						under cross-examination, and I'll quote extract from it:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp; Nana Buah had told 
						this court that when he left his house for Ayeh Kumi's

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp; Nana Buah must have 
						made a mistake as he did when he met me at the airport 
						on 1/7/95 and called me Rice.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp; This is what Buah

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp; The statement is

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp; Are you telling 
						this court that Nana Buah has mistaken you for Rice?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp; Yes&nbsp; 
						...............................</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp; How does Mr. Buah

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp; Sometimes Rice,

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp; How does he address

						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp;&nbsp; If Rice is around 
						I say that's Rice, I am Tom.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Mr. Rice himself has 
						confirmed that it was pw2 who together with pwl brought 
						Dr. Ayeh Kumi. The trial court found the explanation 
						satisfactory, and I have no reason to discredit the 
						finding on this. Pwl himself was not made to identify 
						who the Mr. Rice he was talking about was. If he 
						identified the Mr. Rice with pw3 or somebody else than 
						pw2, then it would been a different situation 
						altogether. It is not dispute that both pws2 and 3 were 
						in the house that day, and there is no evidence from 
						which to conclude they were colluding with Dr. Kells or 
						any other person in this matter. The evidence of pws 
						1,2, and 3, coupled with the untruthful evidence given 
						by James Kaku, Kim, and Rigby concerning the presence in 
						the house that day of Dr. Kells, Mrs. Pennington, pwl 
						and Dr. Ayeh Kumi, show clearly that the plaintiff&#8217;s 
						story was acceptable on a preponderance of 
						probabilities. The trial court was right in finding that 
						Dr. Ayeh Kumi was brought to the house of the deceased 
						that day 29/1/98.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The other point raised 
						was the signature of Ayeh Kumi. I have already referred 
						to the plaintiff account on this. The 1st defendant said 
						because of his eyesight he was unable to identify the 
						signature. But he gave reasons, which I have quoted 
						above when I was summing up the defendants' reasons for 
						alleging the 1989 will was a forgery. That made him 
						conclude it was not the signature of Ayeh Kumi that 
						appears on exhibit 21. We know that it is not the 1st 
						defendant's own signature that is in question, which he 
						could easily have rejected without even seeing it if 
						indeed he did not sign by such document, but we are 
						dealing with a document which, through nobody's fault, 
						he is unable to inspect with the eyes, and is thus not 
						in a position to give his own personal opinion about it. 
						Those that he mentioned as having given him the 
						information that the signature was forged are alive to 
						tell their story. His testimony is not helpful in 
						deciding whether or not the signature in question was a 
						forgery.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On this same issue, 
						James Kaku, Chang Ham Kim and Peter Rigby sought to say 
						it was not Ayeh Kumi who signed it because he did not 
						come to the house that day. But this has been found to 
						be totally false. Their evidence thus in no way advances 
						the defence case of forgery. The other witness who said 
						something about this issue was Alhaji Bashiru Kwaw 
						Swanzy, a lawyer, who said he felt the will was a 
						forgery. He became aware of this will after the death of 
						Blay Miezah. He was asking in xx: &quot;is that Dr. Blay 
						Miezah's signature on it? So why do you feel that this 
						was a forgery?&quot;, and his answer was:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;I knew from Dr. Blay 
						Miezah himself that he had made a will which was in the 
						United Bank of Switzerland. I knew from Dr. Blay Miezah 
						that this will was prepared by lawyers. I&nbsp; knew from him 
						that Dr. Ayeh Kumi was one of the people who signed that 
						will. I found it difficult to believe that this same Dr. 
						Ayeh Kumi would sign this will as he is purported to 
						have done. I happen to know that Blay Miezah left Ghana 
						on 29/1/89, so, how could he have made a will. He had 
						known he was going to leave for Ghana that day why wait 
						till that day? He is not that way.&quot; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">So that his feeling was 
						based on the fact that the same person who signed the 
						earlier will would not turn around to witness this one 
						too. A person's feeling is not evidence as such unless 
						it is founded on some expert knowledge of the particular 
						subject about which he testified. The witness's 
						reasoning is unacceptable in as far as it is illogical. 
						For if the testator himself was able to prepare a new 
						will, then what prevented the earlier witness from 
						witnessing this one too. There is nothing illegal or 
						otherwise that inhibits one person in witnessing several 
						wills made by another person at different times. His 
						evidence too was not helpful in any way. That's about 
						all the defence could offer in proof of the allegation 
						of forgery. The expert evidence too concluded after 
						considering several factors, including the health 
						condition of Ayeh Kumi, that he signed exhibit 21. If 
						one considers that Ayeh Kumi was specifically requested 
						to be brought by the deceased, it gives cause to believe 
						that he needed him for a purpose.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The rest of the 
						defendants' attempt at dislodging the 1989 will, dealt 
						with matters that go largely to credibility. And as 
						decided by the Supreme Court in ANKRAH VS. ANKRAH (1966) 
						G.L.R. 60, holding 6, matters of credibility and what 
						weight to attach to such evidence are questions of fact 
						for the trial court and an appellate court should not 
						interfere except upon well settled rules. Those matters 
						introduced by the defence to discredit the plaintiffs 
						included the fact that the plaintiffs were said to have 
						made or engineered the making of another false will in 
						favour of Dr, Kells. This is the relevant averment of 
						the defendants: &quot;The defendants will at the trial lead 
						evidence to establish that the plaintiffs and in 
						particular the 2nd plaintiff presented a will purported 
						to have be en executed on 15th June, 1992 in identical 
						terms as that of the 29th January 1989, which said will 
						was executed after the death of Dr. Ackah Blay Miezah.'</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This will was put in 
						evidence as exhibit 6, by the defendants. Beside the 
						signature of the deceased, it was witnessed by lsaac 
						Buah, Whajah Kabelah, James Y. Kaku, J.K. Whajah and 
						Nana Asemda VI. When the 1st plaintiff&#8217;s attorney 
						testified, it was suggested to her during xx that 
						exhibit 6 was engineered by her and pwl. She denied any 
						knowledge about it. This woman has at all material times 
						acted by a power of attorney given her by Dr. Kells. She 
						admitted an earlier probate suit no.600/94 that was 
						instituted by Dr. Kells. But she denied exhibit 6 was 
						the subject of that action. In para 3 (c) of an 
						affidavit&#8212;exhibit 5&#8212;she and the 2nd plaintiff deposed to 
						in that suit they categorically denied ever propounding 
						that will dated 15/6/92, and that it was not they who 
						produced it in court in the said suit. The defendants 
						could not rebut this, the defendants led evidence as to 
						how exhibit 6 was executed, which in effect was the 
						result of a conspiracy or collusion between some leading 
						members of the deceased's own family. Note that all the 
						witnesses to exhibit 6 were related to the deceased one 
						way or the other by blood. There is no sufficient 
						evidence that Dr. Kells engineered its preparation or 
						was even aware of it. From the very beginning each and 
						every power of attorney he gave was in respect of only 
						the 1989 will, these powers of attorney were put in 
						evidence as exhibit 1,2 and 3 and in all of these he 
						only made reference to the 1989 will and to none other.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">If there was any 
						wrongdoing it was committed by the deceased's own family 
						members for their own purposes. They held their own 
						meetings and took their own decisions without the 
						involvement of Dr. Kells. The only suspicion attaching 
						to him is the fact that by exhibit 6 he was made the 
						sole beneficiary of the deceased estate, so it could 
						very will be that he might have masterminded its 
						preparation, albeit from behind the scenes. But viewed 
						against the background that a good majority of the 
						deceased family members were in favour of the 1988 will 
						and even sent a delegation to Switzerland. To retrieve 
						it, they would also do anything to destroy the 
						credibility of the will held by Dr. Kells which they had 
						become aware of. Both reasons are purely speculative and 
						do not amount to proof of the question whether exhibit 6 
						was prepared for the benefit of Dr. Kells and with his 
						prior knowledge. There was not sufficient proof of any 
						linkage with Dr. Kells to this exhibit. The relevance of 
						introducing the evidence about exhibit 6 is in respect 
						of the credibility of the witnesses who had something to 
						do with it. But the purpose of which it was introduced 
						by the defendants failed because, as already said, there 
						is nothing to conclude that the 1st plaintiff was 
						involved in its preparation or execution. This attempt 
						also failed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I now turn to the 
						conflicts and/or discrepancies in the presentation of 
						the plaintiffs' case, which I'll consider alongside 
						other points raised by Counsel for the defendants. 
						Counsel listed 21 points which he described as 
						&quot;disquieting circumstances surrounding the making of 
						exhibits 21&quot;, with reference to the decision in IN RE 
						SACKITEY (deced); SACKITEY and Another VS. DZAMOJA 
						(1987-88) 2 G.L.R 434 C.A I'll at this stage refer to 
						the relevant ones of these 21 points, that is I'm 
						leaving out those concerning pw4, which are numbered 
						3,4, 5,6,9,10,15,17 and 18. I'll quote counsel's remark 
						or submission or point and then state my opinion on it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1.&nbsp; &quot;The variance of 
						the pleadings of the plaintiffs, with the evidence on 
						record that there were six persons present with the 
						testator when the will was executed. They called two 
						witnesses and the defence also called two of those who 
						according to their own pleadings were present, to rebut 
						their evidence.&quot; At the trial, the evidence the 
						plaintiffs led was to show that all those named in their 
						pleadings were present in the deceased's house that day 
						when the will was executed. It seems to be at variance 
						with the pleadings which portray the impression that all 
						of them were present at the place the actual execution 
						took place. In my view this does not detract from the 
						validity of the will if indeed it was signed by the 
						testator and witnessed by two persons at the same time 
						and by the plaintiffs were in the house so the 
						discrepancy does not materially affect the determination 
						of the issue of due execution by those named in the 
						will.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2.&nbsp; &quot;Evidence of pw1 
						that he drove Dr. Ayeh Kumi to the testator's residence 
						was rebutted by pw2&quot;. I've dealt with this and concluded 
						that the explanation was satisfactory and that pwl did 
						not identify the Mr. Rice he mentioned with the actual 
						Mr. Rice.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">7.&nbsp; &quot;DW5, Peter Rigby 
						was suborned by the Plaintiffs to give evidence that he 
						drove Dr. Ayeh Kumi to the house that day. If indeed it 
						was DW5 who drove Dr. Ayeh Kumi to the house that day, 
						then obviously PW1 was telling a lie&quot;. The said Peter 
						Rigby was not a witness for the plaintiffs, so how could 
						counsel talk of they having suborned him? Concerning the 
						evidence he gave, he is a person of full age and 
						understanding who spoke about some events which he later 
						retracted. So that if anything at all it was his own 
						credibility which was on the line and that should, if 
						anything at all, go against the party who called him. Be 
						that as it may, his evidence could be rejected as 
						unsupported or even untrue when considered alongside 
						that of PWs 1, 2 and 3.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">8.&nbsp; &quot;In spite of the 
						positive evidence of DW5 that he did not drive Dr. Ayeh 
						Kumi to the testator's house on that occasion, 
						plaintiffs' counsel insisted that it was DW5 who drove 
						him to the residence that day. And how does he reconcile 
						this form of xx with the evidence of his own witness, 
						PW1 ?&quot; There was just one noticeable, question on this 
						after Counsel had taken him on his own affidavit which 
						he had retracted. At any rate the plaintiffs and their 
						witnesses did not say that it was DW5 who drove Ayeh 
						Kumi to the house that day. So it appears the question 
						chipped in during the xx must have been a mistake on the 
						part of counsel, which should not be relied upon as 
						representing the plaintiffs' case. Besides, as already 
						pointed out, this witness had deposed to an affidavit 
						saying he drove Aye Kumi to the house that day, it was 
						later he changed that story, so it appears Counsel 
						should not be seriously attacked for the suggestion made 
						to the witness, DW3 whose Counsel erroneously describes 
						as DW5.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">11. &quot;The plaintiffs 
						deliberately kept the original of the alleged will from 
						the court because of erasures on it&quot;. What is the 
						evidence the original will was erased in parties? By 
						this assertion, it appears the defendants have that 
						original will or at least have seen it. They could thus 
						have tendered it or described the nature of the erasures 
						thereon. But even then the will, exhibit 21 was put in 
						evidence by the defendants. Why is their Counsel now 
						complaining about it? Before then the plaintiffs had, on 
						6/7/95, tendered this will in evidence through PW1 who 
						said he had earlier shown same to Lawyer Erskine. 
						According to the court notes it was admitted without 
						objection and marked as exhibit D. At that stage nobody 
						complained it was a duplicate, and even if it is a 
						duplicate, by section 166 of the Evidence Decree, 1975 
						(N.R.C.D. 323) it was admissible in evidence, unless a 
						genuine question as to its, authenticity was raised or 
						there were some circumstances at rendered it admission 
						unfair. And in such a situation, an objection must be 
						raised under section 6 of the Evidence Decree, failing 
						which the parties would be bound by the document for 
						whatever it was worth. I reject this allegation as mere 
						speculation, unproven and belated.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">12. &quot;PW6 gave evidenced 
						that the said will was a forgery. This is a witness 
						called by the plaintiffs&quot; This Particular witness gave 
						evidence twice in respect of the same matter. In the 
						earlier capacity as plaintiffs' witness, he testified 
						that it was a private person who engaged them to do this 
						examination and they did the work according to the 
						available information supplied. The next time he came in 
						as a court witness again to testify on this same Ayeh 
						Kumi's signature and he said this time he had more 
						information to work on hence he was able to contradict 
						his earlier report. Both reports are available, so it 
						was for the court to decide which of them was more 
						reliable giving reasons for the preference, if it found 
						the witness credible and that both reports were based on 
						information given to the witness. I have already 
						referred to the evidence of the second expert whose 
						conclusion was in favour of the plaintiffs. It would be 
						unfair to rely on only the first testimony of PW6 to 
						conclude that Ayeh Kumi did not sign this will. In fact 
						that would amount to rejecting his second opinion as 
						well as the opinion of the second expert without any 
						just cause. The trial court exhaustively dealt with this 
						question and I am in entire agreement with the law and 
						references made by it. I'll only recount the salient 
						points here. She referred to certain works that 
						represent an accurate process in investigating disputed 
						writings. Besides the visual observation that a court 
						could make by itself, the principal points to consider, 
						as noted by the trial judge, are: &quot;1. The amount of 
						writing available. 2. The similarity of subject-matter. 
						3. The relative dates of the disputed and standard 
						writing. 4. Conditions under which both questioned and 
						known specimens were prepared. 5. The type of writing 
						paper and instrument used&quot;. The learned trial Judge went 
						into extensive exposition of these points. The long and 
						short of it all was that the second opinion of the 
						experts was conducted in accordance with the known 
						principles especially the sufficiency of material to 
						work on.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">13.&nbsp; &quot;An examination of 
						exhibit 21 shows that there is no break in the signature 
						of all the documents tendered by the plaintiffs and the 
						defence, exhibit 21 is the only signature with break. 
						After the break the continuation was smooth and natural, 
						when Dr Aye Kumi was supposed to be suffering from 
						Parkinson disease and his hands were shaky. The 
						impression that he might have taken a medication to be 
						able to sign smoothly in a lifetime is preposterous&quot;. 
						There was the expert opinion. And it was firmly 
						established that he was a sick man and his hands shook 
						when he was writing, and one should thus not be 
						surprised to notice slight changes in his signature as 
						the expert opinion rightly concluded. It is not the case 
						that during that period in his life the man was not 
						writing or signing papers at all. If he did sign, the 
						fact that some changes became noticeable in his 
						signature did not give cause to reject it in any way. I 
						think the break in the signature only gave room for 
						suspicion but this has been satisfactorily explained by 
						the expert as to how it could happen. From exhibit 9 too 
						it was he who signed it in the presence of both the 
						deceased and Mrs. Pennington.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">14. &quot;Exhibit 46 ... was 
						the signature of Dr Blay Miezah signed on the 24th 
						January, 1989 and he is alleged to have signed exhibit 
						21&#8230;..on the 29th January, 1989, that is five days 
						between and yet the two signatures are miles apart&quot;. I 
						fail to appreciate this line of reasoning for there is 
						no link between these two exhibits. What is at stake is 
						exhibit 21 and whether the deceased signed it, which it 
						has been established he did sign. So that if the 
						signature on exhibit 20 is not his that is no business 
						of the plaintiffs, who do not rely on it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">15. &quot;Exhibits 20 and 21 
						were both made the same day 29th January, 1989 and 
						signed by the testator, yet the evidence of PW1 is that 
						the other signatures, that is Dr. Kells and the PWI on 
						exhibit 20 were written in 1993 after the death of the 
						testator&quot;. The implication of this point is that since 
						they bear the same date, if one is&nbsp; said to have been 
						fully executed in 1993, then the other must also have 
						been executed on a date later in time to the one 
						appearing on the face of the document. I don't think the 
						court has to buy such argument. And even the type of 
						deductive argument should not be encouraged lest the 
						court's attention should be diverted from the main issue 
						before it which was whether exhibit 21 was made by the 
						deceased on 21/1/89. There is sufficient evidence the 
						deceased signed the 1989 will.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">19. &quot;Plaintiff's 
						witnesses testified that Mr. Stephens Dw7 was present in 
						the house that day. His evidence by the production of 
						this passport proved the contrary. He arrived in Ghana 
						on 24th December, 1988 and up to date of giving 
						evidence, he had not traveled outside.&quot; This man 
						Stephens whoever he might be, was introduced in the 
						evidence by counsel for the defendants when he was cross 
						examining Pw2. I'll quote from the xx. Counsel asked the 
						witness: &quot;Q&#8212;When you came the car was going in?&quot; the car 
						in question belonged to the Ghana High Commission in 
						London. The witness answered in the affirmative. The 
						next question from counsel was this &quot; You said you 
						thought it was from the government. That car brought one 
						Mr. Stephens to the house..&quot; and he answered, &quot;Yes, Mr. 
						Stephens was also in the house.&quot; (The emphasis is mine.) 
						It was counsel who identified who the Mr. Stephens was, 
						and from the description he appeared to be somebody who 
						had something to do with the High Commission. And when 
						pw3 too said Mr. Stephens was in the house he did not 
						accept a suggestion the said Mr. Stephens was a 
						policeman. And truly dw7 was a policeman as at 29/1/89. 
						And there was evidence an official from the High 
						Commission was there that day, so how can we conclude 
						from the prevailing circumstances that the Stephens they 
						mentioned was dw7? And indeed from the encounter with 
						pw2 in the xx to pw3's inability to accept Stephens as a 
						policeman it cannot be concluded that they were talking 
						about dw7. I should have thought that when they 
						testified, if counsel knew the Mr. Stephens they 
						mentioned was the same as the person who later testified 
						as dw7 he ought to have give them the opportunity to 
						identify him in open court. In the absence of an 
						opportunity to identify who the Mr. Stephens they 
						mentioned was, and in the light of the evidence on 
						record which could point to somebody other than dw7 as 
						the Mr. Stephens, I do not accept that there was any 
						misleading or untrue statement by the plaintiffs' 
						witness.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">19. &quot;There is no 
						mention of the 1989 will in any of the codicils prepared 
						by the testator in 1990 and 1992. This is because on 
						such will existed.&quot; I think I have already disposed of 
						this question, so I need not repeat the reasons I gave 
						in rejecting it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">20. &quot;According to pwl 
						and pw2 when they took Dr. Aye Kumi to his house, his 
						wife pw7 told them that the testator had phoned and 
						wanted pwl to call him back. Yet when pw7 gave evidence, 
						she was not asked to corroboration this piece of 
						evidence.&quot; Unless a statute requires it, 'corroboration 
						is not a general requirement of law in the absence of 
						which the decision of the trial of fact will usually be 
						reversed', see page 5 of the Commentary on the Evidence 
						Decree. The court is allowed to act on the testimony of 
						a single witness only so long as he is a credible 
						witness who testifies from personal knowledge. The point 
						raised by counsel, if valid, would mean that a party 
						would lose a particular issue if there is no 
						corroboration from another witness who it is believed 
						knows something about that particular issue. That 
						certainly is not the law. If there is a witness who 
						could give evidence in support but does not do so, the 
						triel of fact would have to consider whether sufficient 
						evidence has been adduced in support of that issue. That 
						approach is among the best criteria for deciding 
						questions of fact. Even in criminal trials where the 
						prosecution assumes a greater burden of proof, that is 
						proof beyond reasonable doubt, failure to put across the 
						case to all witness called who know something about the 
						particular point will not be fatal, so long as there is 
						other sufficient evidence in proof of the charge. In 
						this case it was for the trial court to decide whether 
						the failure of pw7 to talk about these matters disabled 
						the plaintiffs from proving their case. It appears the 
						trial court did not even give very serious thought to 
						this omission, meaning the decision was uninfluenced by 
						the go with counsel for the defendants on the 
						&quot;disquieting circumstance&quot; he listed. In my opinion 
						therefore, this will of 1989 was sufficiently proved as 
						valid in law without the oral testimony of pw4 taken in 
						London. But a very serious issue was raised with regard 
						to the trial Judge's impartiality or bias in this 
						matter. I'll consider that at this stage.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I must state at the 
						onset that this point did not arise at the trial, it was 
						inferred from the proceedings at the trial, hence it was 
						first raised only when the 1st defendants grounds of 
						appeal were being formulate. This is contained in Ground 
						7 of the grounds of appeal as follows:&#8212; THE BIAS OF THE 
						TRIAL LEARNED JUDGES IS GLEANED THROUGH THE WHOLE 
						JUDGMENT, SHE IS AT, PAINS TO DEFEND THE PLAINTIFFS' 
						POSITION EVEN WHEN IT IS UNTENABLE. THE GROUNDS OF BIAS 
						WILL BE INCORPORATED IN THE ADDITIONAL GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
						ON RECEIPT OF THE RECORD OF APPEAL. SUFFICE TO SAY THAT 
						THE TRIAL LEARNED JUDGE'S JUSTIFICATION OF THE BREAK IN 
						THE SIGNATURE OF DR. AYE KUMI ON EXHIBIT 21 IS A CLEAR 
						EVIDENCE OF BIAS'.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">However, Counsel failed 
						to give the grounds in the additional grounds of appeal 
						which he filed on 12-8-98. It was in his statement of 
						case that counsel addressed this issue, and I consider 
						it necessary to quote same at length for its full force 
						and effect. It reads:&#8212; &quot;THE BIAS OF THE JUDGE Mrs. 
						Pennigton gave me a surprise. I had expected a buxon, 
						elderly lady with greying hair. She turned out to be 
						younger, quite attractive, intelligent and ladylike. 
						And, she spoke English that put her in the middle class. 
						Perhaps being a Catholic she attended a good Catholic 
						Convent. Why should the judge before seeing the witness 
						have expected a buxon, elderly lady with greying hair, 
						and where is the evidence that she attended a good 
						Catholic convent: How did the Judge come to that 
						conclusion?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Later ........... the 
						judge says about her; 'she both looked and sounded a 
						convincing witness of truth. She spoke without guile and 
						without embellishing her story ............. Her 
						evidence as the only available witness of the making of 
						Exhibit 21 is accepted by the court as quality evidence 
						as to the truth about the making of the 1989 Will&#8217; 
						.................... The Judge at this stage had made up 
						her mind to the exclusion of all other evidence on 
						record, for she said that &#8216;Mrs. Pennington left an 
						impression upon one that is indelible. I watched her 
						very closely. I watched for any hesitations as she 
						spoke. Her demeanour in the witness box was excellent. 
						She blushed twice, once during cross-examination.' 
						Finally, the trial learned Judge stated that Ms. 
						Penningtons' evidence stood 'as a gigantic mountain in 
						the midst of hills of varying sizes.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There are several 
						superlatives in her description of Ms. Pennington. 
						Indeed in her assessment of discrepancies in the 
						evidence of the witness, she always concluded by saying, 
						'in any event the issue is whether or not Mrs. 
						Pennington spoke the truth about the signing of exhibit 
						21 ...............This expression is scattered 
						throughout the judgment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is submitted that 
						the trial learned Judge was so clouded or mesmerised by 
						Mrs. Penningtion that nothing else mattered.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Supreme Court has 
						held in Sasu &amp; Anor. Vs. Amua Sekyi (1987-88) GLRD 30

						COURT SHOULD NOT BE SEEN TO BE A PARTY TO CREATE 
						SUPICIOUS.....................A court should be 
						dispassionate but the trial learned judge seemed to have 
						been carried away by passion and this clouded her 
						assessment of the evidence before her.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Having concluded that 
						Mrs. Pennington was a truthful witness what she sought

						conclusion.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Indeed I was at a loss 
						what counsel meant by all this unless he himself bore a 
						hidden suspicion of the judge that she would not be fair 
						to them. For I find it hard to believe that a Lawyer 
						could accuse a judge of being biased on account of the 
						judge's acceptance of a witness's testimony on oath as 
						the whole truth of the matter. If the judge is not there 
						to decide between conflicting evidence and decide which 
						one is the truth then I fail to realise what else the 
						judges are paid to do. A judge is not bound to use any 
						form of words in describing a witness of truth. And in 
						using words of praise for a particular person who the 
						judge has concluded has told the truth to the court, it 
						by no means makes the judge biased. I would even 
						encourage it as a healthy practice to encourage 
						potential witnesses to assist the court with the truth. 
						I concede, however, that it was unnecessary for the 
						trial judge to conjecture whether the witness might 
						&quot;perhaps&quot; have attended a Catholic convent but that per 
						se is not evidence of bias. The totality of counsel's 
						submission on this question appears to revolve on a 
						proper assessment of the evidence on record and what 
						weight to attach to it, because assuming the trial judge 
						considered only the evidence of Mrs. Pennington to the 
						exclusion of all other evidence, that in law does not 
						amount to bias.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Still on the issue of 
						bias, the 1st defendant sought, and was granted, leave 
						on appeal to adduce fresh evidence in support thereof. 
						This was prompted by two letters writing by the trial 
						judge to the plaintiffs herein, in response to request 
						for clarification of certain matters arising out of the 
						court's judgment. The subject-matter was a second grant 
						of probate made to the 1st plaintiff only. Both the 
						Chief Registrar of the High Court and the trial Judge 
						were called by the 1st defendant to give evidence before 
						this court. The substance of the Chief Registrar's 
						testimony was that two separate probates were granted by 
						the trial court. The first one was the direct result of 
						the judgment that is now on appeal; the second was the 
						result of an applicant made to the High Court presided 
						over by the same Judge. After these probates came the 
						letters to which I have made, reference., which the 
						trial judge admitted to have written. It is the 
						contention of the 1st defendant's counsel that the trial 
						judge was in communication with the plaintiffs, and was 
						either paid a monetary reward or was expecting such a 
						reward, hence the charge of bias. I am inclined to 
						reject outright the suggestion that the trial judge 
						either received a monetary reward or was expecting same, 
						this is purely speculative and has no foundation in fact 
						or law. The judge herself was in the witness stand, yet 
						no attempt was made to suggest anything of the sort to 
						her. The law is clear that where a witness is ought to 
						be saddled with any misconduct he/she ought to be given 
						the opportunity to defend that charge. And this is best 
						achieved if the witness is asked about it whilst he/she 
						is in the witness stand. It is most unjust to make such 
						allegations when the witness was never given the chance 
						through questioning to answer such very serious 
						allegations. Moreover the letters relied upon by the 
						defendants do not in any way make any reference to any 
						money already paid or to be paid to the witness. I do 
						not find any evidence of a pecuniary reward on the part 
						of the trial judge. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the contents of the 
						letters, it is clear that the trial judge went beyond 
						what the practice is, which is that normally letters 
						that come to the court are addressed to the registrar 
						who invariably reacts to them, sometimes upon the 
						judge's directives, where necessary. It's pure 
						administrative act, there is nothing judicial about it. 
						In this case the judge chose to reply directly, albeit 
						through the registrar, instead of instructing the 
						registrar to do so. But in my view this administrative 
						blunder, if I am allowed to call it so, should not be 
						interpreted as having influenced the trial judge's 
						decision which is the subject of this appeal. There is 
						nothing to show that the trial judge was influenced in 
						her decision so I'll. dismiss the charge of bias raised 
						against her.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I turn now to the move 
						to London to take the evidence of Mrs. Pennington. It 
						all began on 24/10/95 during the evidence-in-chief of 
						Bernard Rice&#8212;pw3. He said on 13/10/95 he met Mrs. 
						Pennington. He and pw2 tried to convince her to travel 
						to Ghana to attend court. She refused saying she was 
						afraid for her life having regard to the fact that 
						despite all the guarantees given to the deceased before 
						he left London, he had dies in Ghana. Moreover, she 
						herself had been assaulted and threatened in her own 
						home by a Peter Rigby. She had left an affidavit at the 
						Ghana High Commission in London which she asked him to 
						take to the court. This affidavit was tendered as 
						exhibit E. The records show that after this witness was 
						cross-examined by counsel of the defendants, they 
						applied on notice on 27/10/95 requiring &quot;the production 
						of Mrs. Angelina Pennington, the deponent of exhibit E 
						for xx at the trial.&quot; The plaintiffs applied to the 
						court to move to the Ghana High Commission in London to 
						take the evidence of the plaintiff and Mrs. Pennington. 
						This was opposed by the defence. The court ruled on 
						7/11/95 that it had the power to move to London to take 
						the evidence &quot;subject to such terms as the court may 
						deem fit and subject to confirmation by the Chief 
						Justice.&quot; The matter was put off to 10/11/95 for what 
						appears to be the court's terms to be decided. At the 
						sitting of 10/1/95, counsel for the defendants, Mr. 
						Annancy, told the court they were not prepare to bear 
						any part of the costs of the trip. He also asked for a 
						very heavy insurance cover should the court move to 
						London. Those discussions were out off again to 
						15/11/95. At the siting totally terms for the trip were 
						agreed upon. Mr. Annancy had told the court that 
						whenever he traveled with the deceased he paid him a per 
						diem allowance of $2000. A lot of things were also 
						talked about before they settled on the figures for per 
						diem allowances, tickets and other related matters in 
						connection with the impending trip. Two days later on 
						17/11/95, the defendants put in an application on notice 
						for &quot;an order for the safety of the defendants and their 
						counsel.&quot; The accompanying affidavit deposed to by Mr. 
						Annancy gave the reasons or grounds for the application. 
						Counsel for the plaintiffs, Mr. Adumoa-Bossman, deposed 
						to an affidavit in opposition. From the record, it is 
						not indicated whether this application was ruled upon. 
						But that is not very important because it had no 
						influence on the decision to travel since eventually 
						they left for London but without Mr. Annancy and the 1st 
						defendant. The indication from the record is that the 
						court convened in London at the Ghana High Commission on 
						6/12/95. Present were Mr. Adumoa-Gossman for the 
						plaintiffs, Mr. Erskine for the 2nd defendant, and Mr. 
						Blay for the 3rd and 4th defendants. The evidence of 
						Mrs. Pennington was taken as pw4 and was cross-examined 
						by the two defence lawyers present.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defence are not 
						satisfied with this and in ground 1 of the additional 
						grounds of appeal filed on 12/8/98, it is stated that: 
						the learned trial judge has no jurisdiction to move the 
						court to London for the evidence of Mrs. Pennington to 
						be taken. That the proceeding in London and any or all 
						decisions founded thereon are of no effect in law and 
						void ab initio. The judgment is basically founded on the 
						evidence of Mrs. Pennington and if the evidence is void 
						the plaintiff should have been non-suited. I think the 
						practice of non-suit does not exist in the High Court, 
						see EDUFUL VS. PAINTSIL (1966) GLR 27 S.C., it only 
						exists in the district courts, now community tribunals, 
						see ALHASSAN VS. DAKORA (1989- 90) 1 GLR 197. So that 
						the court will have to decide the appropriate relief to 
						grant if the ground of appeal is upheld, but certainly 
						not a non-suit.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial court relied 
						largely on Order 37, rule 5 of the High Court (Civil 
						Procedure) Rules, 1954 (L.N. 140A), in concluding that 
						the court had jurisdiction to travel abroad to take 
						evidence. The court also considered the English case of 
						ST. EDMUNDSBURY AND IPSWICH DIOCESAN BOARD OF FINANCE 
						AND ANOTHER VS. CLARK (1973) 1 Ch 323, the facts and 
						holding of which are sufficiently set out on the ruling. 
						Order 37, r.5 provides:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">'The Court or a Judge 
						may, in any cause or matter where it shall appear 
						necessary for the purposes of justice, make any order 
						for examination upon oath before the Court of Judge or 
						any officer of the Court, or any other person, and at 
						any place, or any witness or person, and may empower any 
						party to any such cause or matter to give such 
						deposition in evidence therein on such terms, if any, as 
						the Court or a Judge may direct.'</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the words of the 
						learned trial Judge, &quot;it is obvious that the Judge has 
						the power to make an order of the case to be adjourned 
						to 'any place' be it in Ghana, Timbuktu or Iceland, 
						because the section does not quality the word 'any' and 
						'any' means 'any'&#8212;an unspecified amount or number, 
						'every', no matter which.&quot; In fairness to the trial 
						Judge, she did not rely on rule 1 of Order 37 as counsel 
						for the defendants submitted in his statement of case. 
						It was counsel for the plaintiffs who made reference to 
						it in his application to the court. But as counsel for 
						the plaintiffs rightly pointed out, rule 1 of Order 37 
						has been repealed by section 180 (2)(a) of the Evidence 
						Decree. Counsel for the defendants submitted that &quot;Order 
						37 r.5 deals with examination and depositions not trial 
						and......... that (it) should pot be read in isolation 
						from Order 37 rules 6-28 ............ that the learned 
						Judge misconceived the scope of Order 37&#8230;..&#8221; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The rest of his 
						submissions relate to the consequences that flow from 
						what he called the void order to take evidence abroad. 
						Counsel for the plaintiffs supported the trial court's 
						decision to travel abroad to take evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I think this is a very 
						important point to consider not only in relation to this 
						case, but because of the very fact that it does not 
						appear to have a precedent that one may look up to, and 
						worse still the language of the rule does not explain 
						the operative phrase 'at any place'. Counsel for the 
						defendants made submissions that I place in the 
						following headings:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1)&nbsp; that Order 37 r.5 
						of the High Court rules is different from Order 35, r.3 
						of the English rules. Whereas the former regulates only 
						examination and deposition, the letter deals with 
						proceedings at the trial so the trial court erred in 
						relying on the English rule;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2)&nbsp; the rule 5 of Order 
						37 should be read in conjunction with rrs 6-28 of the 
						said order;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3)&nbsp; the Chief Justice 
						has no power to have a judge adjourn a trial to outside 
						this country;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">4)&nbsp;&nbsp; the adjournment of 
						a trial is governed by Order 36, r. 19 and it is 
						restricted to places within the Judicial Division to 
						which he is assigned;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">5)&nbsp; it is a question of 
						jurisdiction which the court did not have so whatever it 
						did was void ab initio.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel for the 
						plaintiffs' response to 1 and 2 supra is that the rule 
						''confers sweeping powers on the court of Judge 
						sufficient to permit moving the court to sit out side 
						its accustomed place of sitting;&quot; On 3, 4 and 5 the 
						submission was that so long as the Chief Justice granted 
						the permission and got the approval of the Ministry of 
						Foreign Affairs and the host country Britain, there was 
						no long any legal hurdle. Counsel also submitted that 
						&quot;the evidence of Mrs. Pennington still remains 
						admissible under the rule that, in civil suits, even 
						illegally obtained evidence is admissible in evidence.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I begin with the point 
						raised by counsel for plaintiffs that the court could 
						still use evidence illegally obtained. Reference was 
						made to the worlds of some prominent writers including 
						that of the Vinerian Professor of English law, Rupert 
						Cross. Briefly, I'll state what these learned writers 
						say on this subject. In the 3rd edition of Cross on 
						Evidence, at page 267, he writes that.&quot;.... if evidence 
						is relevant, it matters not how it was obtained, 
						although they recognized that the judge always has a 
						discretion to disallow evidence in criminal case if the 
						strict rules of admissibility would operate unfairly 
						against the accused.&quot; In the 3rd edition of Halsbury's 
						Laws of England, at para. 487 is stated this..&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
						fact that relevant evidence has been obtained improperly 
						does not necessarily render such evidence inadmissble.&#8221; 
						Similar views are expressed by Nokes in his work an 
						introduction to Evidence, 4th edn., at pp 458-461. The 
						attitude of the courts is summed up in this dictum of 
						Compton, J., in the case of R. VS. LEATHAM (1861), 8 Cox 
						C.C 498 at p. 503: &#8220;It matters not how you get it if you 
						steal it when, it would be admissable in evidence.&#8221; The 
						law then is that illegal obtained evidence is 
						admissible, provided it does not involve a reference to 
						an inadmissible confession of guilt, and subject to the 
						overall exclusionary discretion enjoy by the judge at 
						the criminal trial.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">But is the situation on 
						hand about obtaining evidence illegally? I think not. 
						It&#8217;s about the court&#8217;s jurisdiction to move beyond this 
						country on an adjournment to take evidence. If the court 
						has jurisdiction to go abroad to sit, the evidence so 
						obtained would not be illegal in the sense as known to 
						law, it would be perfectly legal evidence. A clear 
						distinction the has to be drawn here between illegally 
						obtained evidence intra vires, and evidence taken ultra 
						vires, whereas the form will stand, the latter will be 
						void ab initio. The cases cited by counsel for the 
						defendants are germane to this discussion. First, as Azu 
						Crabbe J.S.C. (as he then was) said in the case of 
						SHARDEY VS. ADAMTEY and SHARDEY VS. MARTEY and Another 
						(Consolidated) (1972) 2 GLR 380 at p. 3992 &#8220;no court can 
						make any effective order in any proceedings which are ab 
						initio a nullity in order to confer jurisdiction upon 
						itself&#8230;.&#8221; Then in the case of BAKUMA and Others. Vs. 
						EKOR and Others (1972) 1 GLR 133, Sowah J.A. (as he then 
						was) said at p. 139 that &#8220;&#8230;.if in the course of the 
						inquiry, the tribunal assumes more jurisdiction than is 
						lawful, then it exceeds its jurisdiction; there has 
						been, so to speak, &#8216;a usurpation of a jurisdiction&#8217; 
						which he has not got; in such a case, any pronouncements 
						made or order given on the premise of such usurpation 
						would be void and of no effect.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Thus the issue raised 
						is one of jurisdiction and not illegally obtained 
						evidence. The first point raised was that Order 35 r. 3 
						of the English rules on which the case of St. 
						Edmundsbury, etc. vs Clark was decided is not similar to 
						Order 37 r. 5 of our High Court rules. I have already 
						quoted Order 37, r.5 of our rules. Order 35, r.3 of the 
						English rules provides: 'The judge may, if he thinks it 
						expedient in the interest of justice, adjourn a trial 
						for such time and to such place, and upon such terms, if 
						any, as he thinks fit.' It is noted that this provisions 
						part of the general provisions relating to proceedings 
						at the trial. It is totally distinct from the provisions 
						under Order 39 of the English rules which deal with 
						evidence by deposition, examination or commission by 
						order of the court. The current Order 39 r. 1 of the 
						English rules is a revision of the previous Order 37, 
						r.5 which was couched in the same language as our Order 
						37, r. 5. And the present Order 35 r. 3 of the English 
						rules is an almost verbatim reproduction of the old 
						Order 36, r.34 which provided that: 'The Judge may if he 
						think it expedient of the interests of justice, postpone 
						or adjourn trial for such time, and to such place, and 
						upon such terms, it any, as he thinks fit.' Both the old 
						and new rules are placed under the heading TRIAL, and 
						this is an entirely different subject from Order 37 of 
						the old rules and Order 39 of the present English rules. 
						The closest provision in our rules is Order 36, r. 19 
						which provides, 'The Judge may, if he thinks it 
						expedient for the interests of justice, postpone or 
						adjourn a trial for such times, and to such place within 
						the Judicial Division to which he is assigned, and upon 
						such terms, if any, as he shall think fit.'</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the St. Edmundsbury 
						case, the court moved from London to Iken to take the 
						evidence of a sick witness by virtue of the clause 'and 
						to such place' that is contained in Order 35, r.3 (same 
						expressions used in our Order 36, r.19). but with all 
						due respect to both the trial Judge and counsel for the 
						plaintiffs, the St. Edmundsbury case is never an 
						authority for a court to adjourn a case to a place 
						outside the territorial boundaries of Britain to take 
						viva voce evidence. In the St. Edmundsbury case, Iken 
						was part of Britain so the court was only invoking the 
						phrase 'and such other place' to include a place outside 
						London (the usual place of sitting) but which other 
						place was nevertheless part of Britain. And indeed the 
						Judge was emphatic that he was relying on Order 35, r. 3 
						and not Order 39, r.l. Under Order 35, r.3, the court 
						could sit outside its normal place of sitting so long as 
						that place was within Britain. But under Order 39, r.l 
						the court could order evidence on deposition or 
						commission to be taken abroad. So the two procedures 
						have to be carefully distinguished. Counsel for the 
						plaintiffs cited&nbsp; the case of AMOAKO ATTA II VS. OSEI 
						KOFI II (NO.2) (1962) 1 GLR 384 and said in that case 
						the court moved from Accra to sit a Begoro. I can't find 
						it so, but even granting that happened, it would be akin 
						to the situation in the St. Edmundsbury case; the court 
						just moved from one town to the other both within the 
						territory of Ghana. It is no authority for the subject 
						under discussion.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Under the High Court 
						rules, a court can only adjourn a case to a place within 
						the Judicial division in which it is sited. Judicial 
						Division presently means a Region of Ghana. In this 
						connection, one must read Order 36, r.19 alongside Order 
						5 r. 1 (1)-(1 0) of the High Court rules as amended by 
						r. 1 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) (Amendment 
						Rules., 1977 (L.I. 1107). Under the latter legislation 
						the chief Justice is given power of transfer in certain 
						case but the power is limited to the regions in Ghana. 
						And by the provisions of section 104 of the Courts Act, 
						1993 (Act 459), the Chief Justice is given power of 
						transfer of case from one court of judge to another 
						court of judge, the case may be. But once again it is 
						exercisable within the limits imposed by law including 
						territorial restrictions. Under this power, the Chief 
						Justice can order a judge to sit on a case outside the 
						region where he normally sits. There can be no question 
						that the law makers did not have in mind the extension 
						of these rules and law outside the country.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was argued that the 
						court sat at the Ghana High Commission in London with 
						approval of the Chief Justice, and the consent of the 
						Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the host country, 
						Britain. But it must be stated that our Embassies and 
						High Commission abroad are not part of the territories 
						of Ghanaian as defined by Articles 4(1) of the 1992 
						Constitution which proves: 'The sovereign State of Ghana 
						is a Unitary republic consisting of those territories 
						comprised in the regions which immediately before the 
						coming into force of this Constitution, existed in 
						Ghana, including the territorial sea and the air space.' 
						Thus the fact that the hearing took place at the 
						premises of the High Commission does not give any 
						validity to the act. In view of the provisions in Order 
						36, r.l9, Order5, r.l as amended by L.I. 1107, Act 459 
						and Article 4(1) of the l992 Constitution, the court's 
						territorial jurisdiction is limited to the regions of 
						Ghana and the territorial sea and air space. Therefore 
						anybody or authority that is given power to do any 
						judicial act, or perform any administrative function in 
						relation to a judicial act, must necessarily be limit in 
						scope and operation by being confined to the country's 
						territories as by the Constitution defined. The role 
						played by the Chief Justice, the Ministry of Foreign 
						Affairs, and the host country was purely administrative. 
						The court took the judicial decision, thus if the 
						court's decision was wrong, so would it affect the 
						administrative decision taken to facilitate its 
						implementation. So much for the third ground.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I now return too the 
						second ground. Under the old Order 37,r.5 (now Order 39, 
						r.1) of the English rules, a court could only take 
						evidence abroad by deposition or commission as the case 
						may be. The 'any place' in rule 5 of Order 37 certainly 
						accedes a place outside Ghana. The Supreme Court 
						Practice, 1967 edition Vol. 1 at page 507 state that 
						'at' &#8216;any place' includes 'the&nbsp; residence of a witness 
						who is too ill to attend (RE BRADBROOK (1889) 23 
						Q.B.D.226 C.A.), any where in this county or abroad.' 
						But there are provisions made when the evidence is to be 
						taken abroad. As said earlier, our Order 37, r.5 is 
						couched in the same language as the old English Order 37 
						r.5. Under that rule it was not the judge himself who 
						was empowered to travel abroad to take the evidence. The 
						judge has to take the necessary evidence and decide 
						whether there is the need for a party or a wtiness's 
						testimony to be taken abroad. Among the reasons that 
						will influence a court to grant a request to take 
						evidence abroad are that the application is made bona 
						fade; that the issue on which the evidence is required 
						is one which the court ought to try, that the witness is 
						likely to give material evidence; that there is good 
						reason why the witness cannot be examined here. Where 
						the court is satisfied of the need to take the evidence 
						abroad, it ought to make the necessary order under the 
						extensive rules made under orders 37 r. 6 following. In 
						the first place by rules 6 it could be taken on 
						commission by a writ issue for that purpose before a 
						commissioner. Next, by rule 7 it could be done by the 
						issue of a request to examine the witness in lieu of 
						commission. By rule 9 the Ghanaian Consul in any foreign 
						foreign country with which a convention in that behalf 
						has been or shall be made, may be appointed a special 
						examiner for the purpose of taking evidence of named 
						person/s. Even in those cases where special conventions 
						exist with particular countries, a special examiner is 
						appointed to take the evidence. Special forms have been 
						designed for each of these rules and a reading of these 
						forms shows a total exclusion of the judge. The moment a 
						judge sits, he/she is clothed with all the powers 
						conferred by the Constitution and the Courts Act and any 
						other reliant legislation, including power of committal 
						for contempt. If the judge is not sitting here, how will 
						he be able to enforce any breaches of his order or even 
						the court process itself.&nbsp; Again, it is my view that so 
						long as special rules have been made for evidence to be 
						taken abroad, the general rule in rule 5 does not apply 
						to empower the judge to move out of the county; it is 
						the specific rules made for that purpose that must 
						apply. The court's own power of adjourn et l contained 
						in Order 36, r. 19 and it must be to a place within the 
						Region to which he is assigned, or to another Region on 
						with the consent of the Chief Justice. I hold the court 
						had no jurisdiction to move the court to sit in London. 
						Accordingly the evidence of pw4 which was taken there 
						was a nullity ab initio.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel for the 2nd 
						defendant/appellant, in his address, made extensive 
						reference to the law that a person leaves behind only 
						one will, but it may be found in several testamentary 
						instruments. No doubt this is a correct proposition of 
						law. Counsel's view was that the court should have taken 
						into account all other testamentary instruments made by 
						the deceased. Hence the additional ground of appeal 
						that&nbsp; 'the judgment of the court below is wrong in that 
						it granted probate of exhibit 21 without seeing the 
						testamentary instrument which to the knowledge of the 
						plaintiffs Blay Miezah made and deposited in Switzerland 
						to enable her decide if exhibits 21 is that last will 
						and testament of Blay Miezah.' Counsel made reference to 
						the fact that the plaintiffs were aware of the existence 
						of a will deposited in Switzerland in 1988 by the 
						deceased and said it was imperative for the plaintiff to 
						have produced that document too. The plaintiffs' said 
						awareness is contained in para. 2(b) of their reply to

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">5)&nbsp; Except with the

						affidavit sworn by him containing information referred 
						to in paragraph (1) has been filed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel's submission 
						was this: &quot;it is clear from the above that the Probate 
						and administration Rules puts the initial burden on the 
						plaintiff in a probate action to disclose to the court 
						the existence&nbsp; of all the documents of testamentary 
						character relating to the estate of the person whose 
						estate is the subject of the action of which he has 
						knowledge and produce them in court for purposes of the 
						action. Since by definition a will is the lad of all the 
						testamentary documents made by the deceased person in 
						existence at the time of his death and not just one, it 
						means that under rule 7 of Order 6 of L.I.1515, the 
						plaintiff in this action had a legal obligation to seek 
						probate not only in respect of the alleged 1989 will but 
						also of the 1988 will which, in paragraph 2(b) of the 
						reply to the 2nd defendant's statement of defence, was 
						acknowledge by them to be in existence in certain banks 
						in Switzerland, even without the two codicils whose 
						existence they denied. So without producing the original 
						1988 will of which they had knowledge or obtaining 
						unauthenticated copy of it and producing it she 
						plaintiff proceeded to propound only the 1989 alleged 
						will.&quot; With respect,' I think the rules I quoted above 
						impose an equal obligation on the defendants who were 
						positive about the exact location of this will and 
						claimed to have procured a copy thereof from the bank, 
						as against the plaintiff uncertainty, as borne out from 
						their pleadings, as to exactly in which bank in 
						Switzerland was lodged with. And even at the trial, the 
						copy they produced was not duly executed and so did not 
						qualify as a will within the meaning of the law. So it 
						appears that in this case the obligation lay on the 
						defendants to produce the will of 1988. The plaintiffs 
						did not say they had a copy of this will, nor did they 
						say they know precisely where it could be found.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Let me at this stage 
						address the response of counsel for the plaintiffs. To 
						being with, counsel referred to the fact that the 1989 
						will named Dr. Kells as the sole executor, so dodo the 
						1988 will appoint Dr. Ako Adjei as the sole executor of 
						the 1988 will. Counsel's submission was that &quot;from these 
						express appointments as executor it follows that 1st 
						plaintiff had no locus standi for propounding the&#8230;.1988 
						will or applying for probate thereof&#8221; just as must, 
						conversely, as the 1st defendant Dr. Ako Adjei had no 
						locus standi for propounding the 1989 will or applying 
						for probate thereof. All this is clearly because a 
						person not named as an executor of a will has no 
						capacity to apply for probate thereof&#8230;With respect I, 
						think Order 6, r.7 of L.I. 1515 does not impose on the 
						obligation on the executor to produce the will but on 
						any party to the case who has knowledge or possession 
						thereof. 'Party' as used here included a witness for the 
						party to the case. Thus whether the party is the 
						executor or not he is bound to disclose the extent of 
						his knowledge otherwise about any testamentary 
						instrument that he is aware, or in possession, of by 
						himself or his witness or even in the hands of a total 
						stranger. Next counsel argued that the argument by 
						counsel for the 2nd defendants that &#8220;the 1st plaintiff 
						should have propounded the 1988 will alongside the 1989 
						will places an unwarranted onus of proof on the 1st 
						plaintiff.&quot; Counsel contented that there was no need 
						&quot;for the 1st plaintiff to spend time, energy and money 
						to recover from the Swiss bank the 1988 will which the 
						1989 will had expressly revoked....&quot; I think rule 7 does 
						not require that party should propound every document 
						that appears to be a testamentary instrument that is in 
						his possession is aware of; the rule merely demands that 
						all known testamentary instruments be put before the 
						court, if possible, if not the fact why not should be 
						made known to the court. There is good reason for these 
						requirements, if only in satisfaction of the well 
						settled law that a person's will may be found in several 
						documents. Hence the need for the court to know about 
						all such documents so long as they exist, in determining 
						what the last wish or will of a testor was. Accordingly 
						I don't accept counsel's response to the points raised 
						by counsel for the 2nd defendant to whose submission I 
						now return.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I think counsel's 
						concern was answered when the defendant put in evidence 
						all three testamentary documents, namely the 1988 will, 
						1990 codicil and 1992 nuncupative will. These documents 
						were put in to show that the deceased could not have 
						made the 1989 will or that it did not exist, a view 
						concurred in by counsel for the 2nd defendant. Hence the 
						defence contention was that the 1988 will was valid when 
						viewed against the background that both the 1990 and 
						1992 testamentary instruments made reference to only the 
						1988 will but never to the 1989 will. Hence the trial 
						court became compelled to have regard to this averment, 
						the evidence led thereon and the arguments of counsel 
						and to decide on their validity in terms of due 
						execution and authenticity, in order to determine 
						whether they serve at least the purpose for which they 
						were introduced into this case. For it might be argued 
						that if the documents could be rejected for any valid 
						reason, then the court could not rely on them to impugn 
						the authenticity of the 1989 will. Hence a decision on 
						those documents or any one of them relied upon by the 
						dense to discredit the plaintiffs' case would create 
						what I earlier described as an issue estoppel into 
						parts. But upon a deep reflection have considered that 
						since the trial court decided to exclude a determination 
						of these other testamentary instruments from the trial 
						which by the order setting in motion these proceedings 
						was to determine the validity of the 1989 will only, any 
						determination on these documents would have to be 
						limited to whether, if in fact they exist, that fact per 
						se redress the existence of the 1989 will improbable or 
						untrue either in law or in fact. A determination on this 
						would surely create an estoppel and the evidenced there 
						on could be utilized in any future litigation, albeit, 
						to test the witness's credibility. A determination of 
						the validity or otherwise of these of there testamentary 
						instruments, in my view, was not necessary for a 
						decision on the only issue before the court. So the 
						condition required in the case I cited earlier in order 
						for an issue estoppel to arise did not materialise in 
						this case, as the court only had to decide whether the 
						existence of these other documents, if at all, 
						invalidated the 1989 will, and as I have already held it 
						did not and could not. That is the only relevance of 
						these exhibits to this case as borne out by para. 14 of 
						the defendants' statement of defence. In my conclusion, 
						there was sufficient evidence to justify the trial 
						court's conclusion that the 1989 will was valid, even 
						without the evidence taken in London, which, as I have 
						already held was not permissible under the rules of 
						court. But if for some reason I am faulted on the view I 
						hold about the court sitting in London, then the 
						evidence of Mrs. Pennington would be an added booster to 
						the plaintiffs' case for she was a person who, from all 
						accounts, was present with the deceased that day and 
						whose signature appears on the will. I will accordingly 
						dismiss the appeal filled by both the first and the 
						second defendants.</span></p>

						plaintiffs, because she typed Exhibit 21 the WILL said 
						to have been made and signed by Dr. Ackah Blay Miezah on 
						29/1/89. At page 250 she had this to say.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Dr. John Blay Miezah 
						rang Dr. John Robert Kells on Sunday morning and 
						requested him to go to see him. He also asked that I 
						would accompany him. If I had a typewriter to bring it 
						also. Dr. Kells asked me if I would be available to 
						accompany him in the afternoon. The 2 of us set off and 
						in taking the type writer I knew there was typing to be 
						done. The typewriter's make is BROTHER C.E. 30 made is 
						Taiwan. Its an electric typewriter. I got to the house 
						about 2 O'clock. I can&#8217;t be precise. The Mini cab 
						stopped at the gate and we announced who we were to the 
						security at the gate and the Mini cab drove to the front 
						door and we got out. We rang the bell. Dr. Blay Miezah's 
						Manservant opened the door and let us in. I knew this 
						personal servant KAKU, but I don't remember whether it 
						was Kaku or not. After we had been let in by the servant 
						we waited in the waiting room. It was a library. We 
						waited for about 20 minutes and we were escorted into 
						Dr. Blay Miezah's sitting room by Kaku. While, I, John 
						Kells, Blay Miezah and Ayeh Kumi were there, nobody else 
						came there. Dr. Blay Miezah asked me if I would do some 
						typing and I said &#8220;yes&#8221;. So I set up the typewriter on a 
						little ante-room on the left of Dr. Blay Miezah's huge 
						living room. He gave me several sheets of papers which 
						were hand written in BLOCK capitals so I would read it. 
						I had a quick look at the writing and said &quot;Yes I 
						would&quot;. I said I would come and see him if I had a 
						problem. He gave me one sheet of paper with the 
						Butterfly on it and I had to make a good job of it. The 
						emblem was a green Butterfly. Apart from that I think it 
						had OMAN GHANA TRUST FUND under neath the Butterfly. I 
						read the papers he gave me and made sure I could read 
						them before commencing the typing. I plugged the 
						typewriter. I was nervous because it was only one sheet. 
						I asked how he wanted to set out because I didn't think 
						it would all go on initially, but he said not to leave a 
						margin, but to type right across the page. I found that 
						I would do it and I was relieved. I then handed it to 
						Dr. John Robert Kells who handed it to Blay Miezah, who 
						then checked it. After he checked it, he took out his 
						pen and signed. He then passed the paper to Dr. Ayeh 
						Kumi who signed with his own pen which was an old 
						scratching pen. I saw Ayeh Kumi signing the paper. Dr. 
						Blay Miezah asked me if I&nbsp; could witness it, so I did 
						with my own pen. If I saw that piece of paper I would be 
						able to recognise it. I have with me the paper that I 
						typed and which was signed Exhibit 21&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have set out the

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial judge in her

						<span style="font-family: Arial">With the greatest

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Before examining these

						ADDO rule to see whether its invocation in the 
						circumstances was justified. Basically, this rule 
						requires and insists upon consistency. Any divergence or 
						deviation of pleadings from the evidence is fatal. In 
						Dam vrs. Addo courts are enjoined not to substitute a 
						case proprio motu, nor accept a case contrary to or 
						inconsistent with that which the party; himself has put 
						forward. The rule is so strictly observed that where a 
						reply sets up a new case or claim which is at variance 
						with the case put forward, in the statement of claim, it 
						is likely to bring the whole edifice of a suit tumbling 
						down. See Odoi vrs: Hammond [1971] 1GLR 375. Its 
						application sealed the doom of the plaintiff in Seraphim 
						vrs. Amuah Sekyi [1971] 2GLR. 132 CA. where fatal

						<span style="font-family: Arial">At page 406 of

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;It is my view that the

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Taylor J.S.C. also in

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;When a plaintiff 
						departs from his pleadings and his evidence is romancing 
						and conflicting, his credibility is at stake. I do not 
						think a plaintiff succeeds by just leading any evidence 
						in disregard of his pleadings, particularly in this 
						case, where a last minute amendment did not even succeed 
						in reconciling the conflict. Surely the true test is 
						that a party's evidence to win him success in a suit 
						must preponderantly be more probable than that of his 
						opponent. If the quantum does not tip the scale in his 
						favour he must fall. It is not correct to decide issues 
						on the basis that once the evidence is acceptable the 
						propounder of the evidence is home and dry.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is my considered

						WILL.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">But in his evidence

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the pleadings, Mr.

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Mrs. Pennington in her

						have been present, when the will was signed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 1st plaintiff who

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">But he never gave

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						<span style="font-family: Arial">But that is not the end

						have failed to discharge the onus placed on them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In her evidence which I 
						have quoted extenso, Mrs. Pennington said she did not

						document as witnesses, until Dr. Blay Miezah actually 
						asked them to sign and they did.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">But her evidence shows 
						that when she gave the document to Blay Miezah through 
						Dr. Kells, it did not contain the names and addresses of 
						the witnesses typed into the document and forming part 
						of it. Thus when the document was passed on Dr. Blay 
						Miezah, because she and Ayeh Kumi did not know they were 
						going to be witnesses, their names had not been typed on 
						the document.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">So when were their 
						names typed on the document as witnesses?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The witness never told 
						the court how this was achieved.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This court cannot 
						speculate, nor is it given to any court to speculate on 
						the evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A serious doubt is 
						therefore raised about the credibility of the witness, 
						whether indeed the document was typed at the time and 
						place it was said to have been typed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This doubt is further 
						strengthened by the fact that Mrs. Pennington said that 
						the letter head on which she typed the 1989 WILL bears 
						inscription &quot;OMAN GHANA TRUST FUND.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">But examination of 
						Exhibit 21 shows that the letterhead bears the 
						inscription OMAN GHANA FUND.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Now Dr. Blay Miezah had 
						many letterheads as shown in Exhibit 17,18, 21</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Exhibit 17 is written

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Exhibit 18 is written

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						on letterhead OMAN GHANA FUND.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Therefore if the 
						witness, Mrs. Pennington testified that she typed the 
						1989 WILL on a letterhead with the inscription OMAN 
						GHANA TRUST FUND then Exhibit 21 is not the WILL she 
						typed because Exhibit 21 has been typed on a letterhead 
						with inscription OMAN GHANA FUND.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Mrs. Pennington was

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Mrs. Pennington's 
						evidence stands as a gigantic Mountain in the midst of

						buttressed by Exhibit c which I have shown corroborates 
						her evidence of her presence in the house and the fact 
						that Blay Miezah gave a sealed envelope to Dr. Kells in 
						the presence of KAKU D.W.1 and herself&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Since she was such a 
						credible witness, she must be speaking the truth when 
						she said that she typed the 1989 WILL on a letterhead 
						with the inscription OMAN GHANA TRUST FUND.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This fact and her 
						inability to explain to the court how her name and that 
						of Dr. Ayeh Kumi came to be typed on the 1989 WILL at a 
						time when she did not know that she and Dr. Ayeh Kumi 
						would be called upon to sign as witnesses raise grave 
						doubts as to her credibility.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the basis of her

						Preponderance of evidence discharged the burden placed 
						upon them to show that the 1989 WILL is genuine.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;It is trite learning 
						that a court of appeal will not interfere with a

						and hearing the witnesses and watching their demeanour; 
						and that it is only in cases where it is manifestly 
						clear that the evidence weighs heavily against the 
						judgment of the court that the court of appeal will be 
						entitled to vary such judgment. In such a case the court

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Now the question is, 
						were these two attorneys for the 1st plaintiff, Ms. 
						Sophia Ofori-Atta and Nana Arvo Buah acting jointly or 
						jointly and severally?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There is no evidence 
						before the court that these two Attorney were acting 
						jointly or jointly and severally, Consequently I hold 
						that the power of attorney granted to Ms. Sophia 
						Ofori-Atta is invalid.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">MR. STEPHENS</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">One of the people, 
						claimed by the Plaintiffs to have been present at the 
						time Dr. Blay Ackah Miezah signed the 1989 WILL was Mr. 
						Stephens, a Police officer assigned by the Government to 
						Dr. Miezah as his guard.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This witness was able 
						to demonstrate to the court that he was not in London on 
						29/1/89, the day the said WILL was made. He tendered his 
						passport and plane ticket, which showed that he traveled 
						to Ghana on 24/12/88.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is what the trial 
						judge said about the inability of the plaintiffs to 
						prove their case, vol. 3 page 142:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Indeed it is strange 
						that Mr. Stephens was admittedly assigned by the Ghana 
						Government to be with Blay Miezah whenever he traveled; 
						he was assigned to keep his passport; yet evidence was 
						given that on the 29th of January, 1989 Blay Miezah 
						traveled without a passport and he traveled without his 
						guard. Be that as it may, the plaintiff could not prove 
						Stephens presence at 60 Avenue Road that day, nor that 
						he traveled with Blay Miezah. In view of the ticket and 
						the passport tendered in evidence, the court accept his 
						version that he was in Accra in 29/1/89&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is rather strange 
						that the plaintiff would claim that Mr. Stephen was 
						among those present at Blay Miezah residence that day 
						when according to him and indeed according to the date 
						on his ticket and in his passport he traveled to Ghana 
						on the 24th of December, 1988. Somebody was lying or had 
						genuinely made a mistake. It certainly was not Mr. 
						Stephen. The trouble emanated from the Plaintiff.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It seems to me that if 
						the plaintiff have made a claim that Mr. Stephen was 
						present at the time Dr. Blay Miezah signed the 1989 WILL 
						and the court has found as a matter of fact that this 
						claim was false, and that some body was lying or had 
						made a genuine mistake, and that it was not Mr. 
						Stephens, then the obvious and reasonable conclusion 
						which the court could arrive at, is that the plaintiff 
						have not been able to prove their case on the 
						preponderance of the evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">JAMES KAKU</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">James Kaku was a 
						witness for the appellants. But this is how p.w.2, 
						Thomas James Heath Shenton head of the security team who 
						worked for Blay Miezah and a witness for the Plaintiffs 
						described him:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Kaku was basically a 
						manservant. He looked after all the needs of Blay 
						Miezah. He cooked, went to the market and was with him 
						all the time unless he was in conference. He ushered 
						people in.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Any person who held 
						such a position in the house of Dr. Ackah Blay Miezah 
						must certainly be recognised as a very material witness 
						who could tell the court, what ever transpired in that 
						house in London on the 29th January, 1989, unless for 
						reasons which must be stated, the court decides not to 
						believe such a witness. No such reasons have been 
						advance by the trial judge why the evidence of this 
						witness should not carry weight. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Rather on page 132 vol. 
						3 the learned trial judge said:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The defendants called 
						three witnesses, who were present at 60 Avenue road on 
						the 29th January, 1989 Kaku D.W.l. KIM DW2 and Peter 
						Rigby D.W.3. They testified that even though they were 
						present in the house that day, they never saw Dr. Kells, 
						Mrs. Pennington or Nana Arvo Buah at 60 Avenue road, nor 
						did they see Blay Miezah sign any document. (They could 
						not call any eyewitness to rebut pw4, Mrs. Pennington). 
						So what they had to rely on was circumstantial evidence 
						which by the rule in the State vrs: Anani Fiadzo [1961] 
						1 GLR 461 and Ali Kessena vrs: The State [1962] 1 GLR 
						144, must lead to an irresistible inference of quilt.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is not exactly clear 
						what the trial judge meant by saying that they could not 
						call eyewitnesses to rebut PW4, Mrs. Pennington.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The fact is that DW1, 
						DW2 and DW3 were witnesses who testified for the 
						defendants. Their evidence, which directly contradicted 
						the evidence of PW4 who testified for the plaintiffs, 
						was that, they never saw PW4 at the house of Blay Miezah 
						60 Avenue Road London, on the 29/1/89. These witnesses 
						testified about what they heard and what they saw.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is not necessary in 
						law to call any other eyewitness to rebut PW4. The 
						evidence of PW4 is not a presumption which must be 
						rebutted. It is a matter of credibility as to which of 
						these witnesses is speaking the truth. It was therefore 
						a misdirection in law on the part of the trial judge, to 
						ask for eyewitnesses to rebut the evidence of PW4, Mrs. 
						Pennington.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In her judgment at 133 
						vol. 3 the learned trial judge found that Exhibit C 
						which was a letter written to Dr. Kells by Blay Miezah 
						and tendered in evidence by&nbsp; PW1 established that DW1, 
						DW2 DW3 were lying when they denied seeing Mrs. 
						Pennington on 29/1/89.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">But Exhibit C indicated 
						that the people present in the house of Dr. Blay Miezah 
						on 21/1/89 in London were Dr. Kells, James Kaku and Mrs. 
						Pennington. Dr. Ayeh Kumi was never mentioned as being 
						present. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">But it is quite obvious 
						that if he were present he would have been mentioned.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Therefore if Dr. Ayeh 
						Kumi was present as the plaintiffs claimed and yet he 
						was never mentioned in the letter, Exhibit 'C' cannot be 
						genuine. It could have been made like Exhibit 6 which 
						was allegedly prepared and signed by Blay Miezah when he 
						had been dead for some time.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The situation therefore 
						is that either Exhibit 'c' is genuine and therefore Dr. 
						Ayeh Kumi was never present in the house, or Dr. Ayeh 
						Kumi was present but the letter is not genuine.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">If Dr. Ayeh Kumi was 
						not present, then he could not have signed the WILL of 
						1989, as the plaintiffs claimed he did.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">If he was present he 
						would have been mentioned in Exhibit 'C'. Whichever way 
						the evidence is looked at, Exhibit 'C' is not a document 
						upon which the credibility of DW1, DW2 and DW3 could be 
						decided. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my considered 
						opinion, it was wrong therefore for the learned trial 
						judge to hold that based on Exhibit 'c', DW1 DW2 and DW3 
						were lying.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">An appeal is by way of 
						rehearing and an appellate court is entitled to draw an 
						inference from the admitted facts or evidence which is 
						different from that made by the trial judge.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this case, I find 
						that the doubt created by Exhibit 'C' are such that the 
						evidence of James Kaku the manservant of Blay Miezah is 
						preferable. And that is, that Dr. Kells and Mrs. 
						Pennington were never at the London house on 29/1/89.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">CASE FOR DEFENDANTS</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The case for the 
						Defendants was that the 1989 WILL had been forged. They 
						claim that the plaintiffs got hold of one of the signed 
						letterheads of Blay Miezah and typed the body of the 
						WILL on that letterhead.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">They were able to 
						demonstrate that Dr. Blay Miezah had indeed signed many 
						blank letterheads.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">An example was Exhibit 
						34. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial judge also 
						found at page 152 vol. 3 as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;It is most unfortunate 
						that Dr. Blay Miezah left blank signed headed note 
						papers. This was rather irresponsible and dangerous and 
						has no doubt created unnecessary problems for every 
						body.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">They were also able to 
						demonstrate that one of these signed blank letterheads 
						had been, used to prepare Exhibit 6, which has been 
						accepted as forged by the plaintiffs and defendants.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Indeed PW1 admitted 
						that Exhibit 6 was prepared after the death of Blay 
						Miezah. It is relevant to note that Exhibit 6, the 
						admitted forged WILL, is almost in exact terms as 
						Exhibit 21, the subject matter of this appeal</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">They defendants were 
						also able to demonstrate that Exhibit 20 which is also a 
						document signed by Dr. Ackah Blay Miezah, in which 50 
						million dollars and 25 million dollars respectively have 
						been given to Mr. Ako Adjei and Mr. Kojo Erskine for 
						their services and support rendered, was a fraudulent 
						document which was made on the 29th January, 1989, the 
						same day on which the 1989 WILL was made, and had a 
						similar typescript as Exhibit 21.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned trial judge 
						however found that this document was executed with the 
						knowledge and consent of Dr. Blay Miezah on 29/1/89. I 
						found that the trail judge erred on the evidence by this 
						holding, when PW1 Nana Arvo had admitted in 
						cross-examination that Exhibit 20 was a fraudulent 
						document&nbsp; prepared in November-December 1992 and made to 
						appear as if prepared in 1989.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendants also 
						demonstrated that the name of the Bank in the 1989 WILL 
						had been spelt wrongly.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendants further 
						demonstrated that the name of Blay Miezah's hometown has 
						been spelt Allenzura, instead of Allengenzule.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is what the 
						learned trial judge said of these two serious errors at 
						page155 vol. 3.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The wrong spelling of 
						the Bank's name and that of Allengenzule truly is 
						strange (that Blay Miezah would spell them wrong) but 
						the only way we could have found out why they were so 
						spelt was for the defendants to have cross-examined Mrs. 
						Pennington in respect of these.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It would appear from 
						this holding that the learned trial judge, did not 
						appreciate the case being put forward by the defendants.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendants were 
						saying that if Dr. Blay Miezah had made the 1989 WILL he 
						would not have mis-spelt the name of the Bank he had 
						been dealing with over the years, nor would be mis-spelt 
						the name of his own hometown. That the 1989 was made by 
						plaintiffs who could not spell the name of the Bank or 
						the hometown of Dr. Blay Miezah.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There was no legal 
						burden on the defendants to cross-examine the witness 
						Mrs. Pennington to find out from her why these names 
						have been wrongly spelt.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial judge 
						misdirected herself in law by holding that the 
						defendants had a duty to cross-examined Mrs. Pennington 
						to find out why Allengenzule had been spelt Allenzura 
						and why BAHNNOFSTASSE had been spelt BUNHASTRASSE.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendants were 
						asking the court to come to the conclusion that since 
						Blay Miezah would not have mis-spelt his own Bank and 
						Hometown names in the WILL if he had really made that 
						WILL, then that document, 1989 WILL could not have been 
						made by him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I find that these 
						points raise very serious doubts about the genuineness 
						of the 1989 WILL.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned trial judge 
						then posed this question at the page 163 vol.3 &quot;Can we 
						in the instant case say that the only irresistible 
						inference or conclusion that could be drawn from the 
						surrounding circumstances (the conflicts as to whether 
						Dr. Kells and Mrs. Pennington entered the yard with 
						Minicab or got out before the gate was opened by Rice, 
						whether Dr. Kells and Mrs. Pennington departed first or 
						Dr. Ayeh Kumi and Nana Arvo Buah went before they did, 
						whether or not it was Shenton or Rice who went with Nana 
						Arvo to fetch Dr. Ayeh Kumi etc.) is that Dr. Blay 
						Miezah never signed Exhibit 21 and it was never attested 
						by Dr. Ayeh Kumi and Mrs. Pennington?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There is no doubt that 
						there are few discrepancies in the times, events, and 
						movements of those who visited Dr. Blay Miezah in the 
						after noon of 29/1/89.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">If the trial judge has 
						found as a fact that there were few discrepancies in the 
						case for the plaintiffs, then she should have held that 
						on the preponderance of probabilities, they have not 
						been able to make out a case for the court to find for 
						them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A plaintiff must win on 
						the strength of his own case not on the weakness of the 
						defendants case:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">See SASU VRS: AMUA 
						SEKYI [1987&#8211;88] 2 GLR 221. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I find from the 
						evidence adduced by the plaintiffs that on the 
						preponderance of probabilities, they have not discharged 
						the burden placed on them by the law to merit the court 
						finding for them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">JURISDICTION</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellants have 
						also questioned the power of the trail court to move 
						from Accra, Ghana and to sit in London in the United 
						Kingdom. It is their case that the court had no 
						jurisdiction to sit in London.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This issue was raised 
						when it was submitted for the 1st plaintiff that his 
						life would be in danger, if he came to Ghana to testify 
						in this case. An application was therefore made on his 
						behalf for the court to move from Accra Ghana, to London 
						and take his evidence, and that of Mrs. Pennington.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendants 
						vehemently opposed the application, maintaining that 
						Ghana was a peaceful Ghana, where everybody was safe.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The court however ruled 
						that under order 37.5 of the Court rules, she had 
						authority to move from Accra to London to take the 
						evidence of the 1st plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Accordingly the court 
						was moved from Ghana to London and sat at the high 
						commission on the 6th of December, 1995. But 
						surprisingly the person for whose safety the court had 
						moved from Ghana to London did not appear before the 
						court to give evidence. For the three weeks when the 
						court was in London the 1st plaintiff did not appear 
						before the court. Mrs. Pennignton however did appear and 
						gave evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The question is did the 
						court have jurisdiction under order 37.5 to move outside 
						Ghana?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned trial judge 
						said she had jurisdiction to move to Timbuktu, or 
						Iceland under 0.37.5.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">But let me see what 
						order 37.5 says:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The court or a judge 
						may in any cause or matter where it shall appear 
						necessary for the purpose of justice, make any order for 
						examination upon oath before the court or judge or any 
						officer of the court, or any other person and at any 
						place, of any witness or person, and may empower any 
						party to any such cause or matter to give such 
						deposition in evidence therein on such terms, if any, as 
						the court or judge may direct.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned trial judge 
						said in her ruling as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;I think rule 5 gives 
						very very wide powers to the court. The criterion in 
						that section is &quot;where it shall appear necessary for the 
						purposes of justice&quot; and the operative words are make 
						any order for examination upon oath before the judge ... 
						at any place of any witness or person.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">So that it is obvious 
						that the judge has the power to make an order for the 
						case to be adjourned to &quot;any place&quot;, be it Ghana, 
						Timbuktu or Iceland because the section does not qualify 
						the word &quot;any&quot; and 'any' means &quot;any&quot; &#8212;an unspecified 
						amount or number, every, no matter which.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;It is my considered 
						opinion that this interpretation by the learned judge of 
						order 37 rule 5 is erroneous. It is trite law that the 
						jurisdiction of any court in any country, is limited to 
						the territorial boundaries of that country. That is why 
						we have extradition treaties, by which persons who flee 
						from one country can be brought back to that country, 
						since then court cannot move to sit in foreign lands.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There are practical 
						considerations which limit the jurisdiction of any court 
						to the territorial boundaries of its country. </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">One of them is that in 
						a foreign land, the court will not be able to exercise 
						its powers.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">If a witness commits 
						perjury or contempt in facia curia in foreign land, the 
						court would be powerless to deal with such a person, 
						since it could not commit him to prison or bring him 
						down to Ghana for punishment or punish him in any way.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">If a court has no power 
						or cannot enforce its orders, then it is no court. That 
						is what the court will be reduced to when it sits 
						outside Ghana. I therefore hold that order 37.5 does not 
						confer power on the court to sit anywhere, outside 
						Ghana. &quot;Any place&quot; should be interpreted to mean, any 
						place in Ghana.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial judge 
						therefore had no jurisdiction to sit outside Ghana. The 
						evidence obtained therefore is a nullity.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Lastly I come to the 
						handwriting experts. One of them supt. Alhaji Bukari 
						Zakubu in Exhibit G. and as PW6, testified that the 
						signature of Dr. Ayeh Kumi on the 1989 WILL was a 
						forgery.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Then as court witness 
						DW4 the same person testified that the signature he had 
						earlier declared to be a forgery was&nbsp; now genuine.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He explained the 
						apparent contradiction by stating that he was not 
						furnished with sufficient materials in his earlier 
						examination to enable him make a meaningful assessment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Whatever it is, the 
						fact remains that this witness has standing in his name 
						two reports which are diametrically opposed. It will not 
						be safe to act on such discredited evidence in a case in 
						which Billions of Dollars are involved.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Taking all these 
						factors into considerations it is my considered opinion 
						that this appeal must succeed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I shall therefore allow 
						the appeal and set aside the judgment of the High Court 
						dated 20th May, 1997.</span></p>
