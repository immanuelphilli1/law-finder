						<font face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US">This appeal is 
						from the judgment of the High Court, Sekondi dated the 
						20th day of February 2009 in which judgment was entered 
						in favour of the plaintiffs/ respondents, now the 
						Respondents against the 1st defendant company and the 
						2nd defendant church, now the Appellant church in 
						respect of a building at Takoradi known as &quot;SCOA 
						Building&quot; in the Western Region of Ghana. The appellant 
						church feeling aggrieved by the judgment is praying this 
						court to set aside the judgment and in its place enter 
						judgment in its favour on eight grounds of appeal. 
						However in his written submissions filed on 8th June 
						2009 learned counsel for the appellant argued only four 
						of the grounds of appeal. It is deemed therefore that 
						the other grounds of appeal have been abandoned and 
						consequently nothing will be said about them in this 
						judgment. The grounds of appeal argued are as follows: 
						&quot;(a) The learned trial judge misdirected himself in law 
						by granting to the plaintiffs reliefs which were not 
						endorsed on the plaintiffs writ of summons. (b) The 
						learned trial judge erred in law by holding that the 2nd 
						defendant/ appellant and the lst defendant/ respondent 
						had perpetrated fraud on the plaintiffs/ respondents for 
						lack of evidence to that effect. (c) The holding by the 
						trial court that the late Addo Twum paid half of the 
						purchase price of the SCOA building and thereby made him 
						the owner of the disputed premises is not supported by 
						the evidence on record. (d) The learned trial judge did 
						not give adequate consideration to the case of the 2nd 
						defendant/ appellants.&quot; The defendant company neither 
						filed an appeal against the judgment nor did it file any 
						statement of case in response to the appeal herein. It 
						is therefore not a party to this appeal. Briefly, the 
						facts of this case are that there is a building at 
						Takoradi called and popularly known as &quot;SCOA Building&quot;. 
						The SCOA Building which consists of an office and 
						business premises (warehouse) originally belonged to a 
						Limited Liability Company called &quot;SCOA Ghana Ltd.&quot;. By a 
						Lease dated 20th day of February 1961 between the 
						Government of Ghana and SCOA Ghana Ltd. (herein the 
						Company), Plot No. 50B in the Harbour Business area of 
						Takoradi on which the SCOA Building is situated or 
						erected, was demised or leased to the Company for a term 
						of fifty years (50 years) certain. On the 30th day of 
						December 1994, SCOA Ghana Ltd. by a Deed of Assignment, 
						assigned the unexpired or residue term of its Leasehold 
						interest in the entire SCOA Building to the Resurrection 
						Power &amp; Living Bread Ministries International (the 
						appellant herein) for a consideration of forty million 
						old cedis (¢40,000,000.00). The Deed of Assignment was 
						signed by the SCOA Ghana Ltd.&#8217;s attorney, one Mr. Xavier 
						Boucherit on behalf of the company and Rev. Bernard 
						Atta-Boateng, the then Regional Pastor of the appellant 
						church on behalf of the church. One Mr. Halifax 
						Addo-Twum (deceased) also signed the Deed of Assignment 
						as a witness on the side of Rev. Bernard Atta-Boateng. 
						The late Mr. Halifax Addo-Twum was a founding member and 
						one of the elders of the appellant church. This Deed of 
						Assignment was tendered in evidence during the trial as 
						Exhibit E. Exhibit E on its face has been stamped and 
						registered. S.G.S. (Ghana) Ltd. - the defendant company 
						herein was occupying the offices section of the SCOA 
						Building as tenants. It is alleged that the late Mr. 
						Halifax Addo-Twum contributed and paid half (i.e. 
						¢20,000,000.00) of the purchase price of the SCOA 
						Building and that because of that the appellant gave the 
						offices portion i.e. the warehouse of the building to 
						him. It is also the case of respondents who are the 
						administrators of the estate of Mr. Halifax Addo-Twum 
						that during his lifetime Mr. Halifax Addo Twum was 
						collecting the rents from the defendant company as owner 
						of that section of the SCOA building and continued to 
						collect those rents until his demise and that even after 
						his demise the respondents were collecting those rents 
						until somewhere later when the appellant wrote to them 
						to stop collecting these rents, claiming that the whole 
						of the SCOA Building was the property of the appellant 
						church. The appellant through its solicitor also wrote 
						to the defendant on 31-10-1995 informing it that the 
						whole of the SCOA Building was the property of the 
						church and therefore they (i.e. the defendant) should 
						cease any further payment of rent to the respondents. 
						The evidence suggests the defendant did not comply with 
						the church's request so the appellant church per its 
						Trustees issued a writ of summons in Suit No. E2/59/2006 
						against the defendant company at the High Court, Sekondi 
						claiming a recovery of possession of the portion or part 
						of the SCOA Building occupied by the defendant and an 
						order of perpetual injunction restraining the defendant, 
						its agents, assigns and workers from having anything to 
						do with the disputed property. The defendant after 
						entering appearance to the writ did not file any 
						statement of defence in the matter. In the course of the 
						proceedings the defendant and the appellant church 
						negotiated a settlement of the matter out of court and 
						subsequently filed terms of settlement. On the 13th day 
						of July 2006, the High Court, Sekondi accepted and 
						adopted the terms of settlement and entered a consent 
						judgment thereon in favour of the appellant church. When 
						the respondents herein got to know of the consent 
						judgment they became aggrieved. Consequently, on the 
						14th day of November 2006 the respondents as plaintiffs 
						issued a writ of summons in another High Court, Sekondi 
						seeking against the defendant company and the appellant 
						church the following reliefs. &quot;(1) An order to set aside 
						the consent judgment in Suit No.E2/59/2006 dated the 
						13th day of July 2006 obtained against the 1st defendant 
						and in favour of the 2nd defendant then plaintiffs on 
						ground of fraud. (2) An order to grant the plaintiffs 
						liberty to defend the suit.&quot; In their statement of claim 
						the respondents have pleaded the particulars of fraud in 
						paragraph 11 therein as follows. (11) The plaintiffs say 
						that the judgment was fraudulently procured. Particulars 
						of fraud (a) That the 1st defendant failed and or 
						refused to inform the plaintiffs of the action against 
						it by the 2nd defendant. (b) That at the time of the 
						consent judgment the defendants knew or ought to have 
						known that the plaintiffs were and are owners of the 
						property. (c) That the defendants condoned and connived 
						to keep the plaintiffs uninformed of the pending suit. 
						(d) That the 1stdefendant clandestinely refused to file 
						a defence so that the 2nd defendant would have a field 
						day which it indeed had.&quot; Each of the defendant and the 
						appellant resisted the action by filing a statement of 
						defence inter alia denying the allegation of fraud 
						levelled against them. The appellant also counterclaimed 
						for the following relief against the respondents: &quot;(1) 
						An amount of eight thousand dollars ($8000.00) being the 
						last rent collected from the 1st defendant without due 
						permission and lawful authority at the current bank 
						rate.&quot; l will first of all proceed to consider the 
						complaints of the appellant forming the basis of grounds 
						(a) and (b) of the appeal together. Essentially the 
						complaints and submissions of learned counsel for the 
						appellant on these grounds of appeal are that, (1) the 
						learned trial judge erred in law in granting to the 
						respondents reliefs which were not endorsed on the writ 
						of summons; (2) that the learned trial judge proceeded 
						on a wrong premise when he suo motu amended the 
						endorsement on the writ of summons and the relief in the 
						counterclaim of the appellant at the time he was writing 
						his judgment to include a declaration of title to the 
						disputed property, a relief not asked for particularly 
						by the respondents; (3) that the learned trial judge 
						erred in law when he ruled that the principle enunciated 
						in holding (1) of the case of Lamptey v. Hammond 
						(1986-87) 1 G.L.R. 327 applies to only default 
						judgments, when in fact that principle applies as a 
						general principle of law to all cases, and (4) finally, 
						that the learned trial judge erred in law in finding and 
						holding that the defendant and the appellant perpetrated 
						fraud on the respondents in respect of the consent 
						judgment when there is no evidence to support that 
						finding and conclusion. Learned counsel for the 
						appellant cited cases like Lamptey v. Hammond (supra), 
						Dam v. Addo &amp; Brothers (1992) 2 G.L.R. 200, Okofo 
						Estates Ltd. v. Modern Signs Ltd. (1991-92) S.C.G.L.R. 
						253 in support of his submissions. The response of 
						learned counsel for the respondents as contained in his 
						written answer filed on 9th February 2009 is that, (1) 
						even in the absence of proof of fraud all that the 
						respondents needed to set aside the consent judgment was 
						to disclose that there is a reasonable defence to Suit 
						No. E2/59/2006 available to the respondents to warrant 
						giving them leave to join and defend that suit and cited 
						the case of Adu v. Ankumah (1972) 1 G.L.R. in support of 
						that submission; (2) that the rule in Dam v. Addo &amp; 
						Brothers (supra) is not inflexible and it does not also 
						represent the present state of the law as indicated by 
						the cases of Butt v. Chapel Hill Properties Ltd. 
						(2003-2004) 1 S.C.G.L.R. 636; J.K. Serbeh &amp; Co. Ltd. v.

						2004 (C.1.47) and finally, (3) that in any case the 
						respondents had established fraud against the defendant 
						and the appellant and therefore the learned trial judge 
						was right in so finding and concluding. The law is clear 
						that setting aside a judgment or an order of a court is 
						entirely within the discretion of the trial court or 
						judge and therefore where a judge has exercised his 
						discretion and set aside or has refused to set aside a 
						judgment or order, anybody who seeks to impugn that 
						exercise of discretion, in order to succeed, must be 
						able to show that either the exercise of that discretion 
						was based on wrong principles of law or that it was 
						exercised on wrong or inadequate principles or 
						materials; or that the trial court acted or 
						misapprehended the facts. It is however equally true 
						that an appellate court like this one has the power and 
						the jurisdiction to interfere with the exercise of a 
						discretionary jurisdiction by a trial court if the above 
						factors stated herein above are established. See dictum 
						of Lord Atkin in Evans v. Bartlam (1937) A.C. 473, H.L. 
						at 480, and the local cases of Brempong II v. Amofa 
						(2001-2002) 2 S.C.G.L.R. 177, S.C. and Klimotechnik 
						Engineering Ltd. v. Skanska Jensen International 
						(2005-2006) S.C.G.L.R. 913 at 933, S.C. I will therefore 
						proceed to consider whether the learned trial judge 
						acted properly and procedurally in proprio motu amending 
						the endorsement on the writ of summons and the relief in 
						the counterclaim at the stage he did and whether he 
						rightly granted the consequential reliefs following that 
						amendment. The procedure for amending a writ of summons 
						and pleadings is provided under order 16 of the High 
						Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2004 (C.1.47). Under the 
						rules of court (C.1.47) there are two types of amendment 
						of a writ of summons and pleadings, namely, (1) 
						Amendment without the leave of the court and secondly, 
						(2) amendment with the leave of the court. The plaintiff 
						may amend the writ only once without the leave of the 
						court at anytime before the close of pleadings. See 
						order 16 rule 1(1) of C. 1.47. Also, a party may, 
						without the leave of the court, amend his pleadings once 
						at anytime before the pleadings are closed. See order 16 
						rule 3(1) of C. 1.47. Where the plaintiff or a party has 
						amended his writ of summons or pleadings, before the 
						close of pleadings the amended writ or pleadings must be 
						served on the defendant. The other or second type of 
						amendment is amendment of a writ or pleadings with the 
						leave of the court after the close of pleadings. See 
						Order 16 rule 5(1) and 7(1) of C.1.47. This type of 
						amendment may be applied for or may be ordered by the 
						court or judge suo motu at any stage of the proceedings. 
						Thus order 16 rules 5(1) and 7(1) of C. 1.47 provide as 
						follows: &quot;5(1) Subject to order 4 rules 5 and 6 and to 
						the following provisions of this rule the court may at 
						any stage of the proceedings upon an application by the 
						plaintiff or any other party grant leave to (a) the 
						plaintiff to amend the plaintiff's writ or (b) any party 
						to amend the party's pleadings on such terms as to costs 
						or otherwise as may be just and in such manner as it may 
						direct. 7(1) For the purpose of determining the real 
						question in controversy between the parties or of 
						correcting any defect or error in the proceedings, the 
						court may, at any stage of the proceedings, either of 
						its own motion or on the application of any party order 
						any document in the proceedings to be amended on such 
						terms as to costs or otherwise as may be just and in 
						such manner as it may direct. (2) This rule shall not 
						apply in relation to a judgment or order.&quot; It appears to 
						us that the learned trial judge purported to have suo 
						motu amended the writ of summons and the counterclaim 
						under order 16 rule 7(1) of the High Court (Civil 
						Procedure) Rules, 2004 (C.1.47). We think, however that, 
						order 16 rule 7(1) of C.1.47 does not confer power or 
						any jurisdiction on a court or judge to suo motu make 
						the amendment himself. What the rule authorizes is that 
						the court or a judge either on his or its own motion or 
						on the application of any party may order any document 
						such as a writ of summons or pleadings, to be amended on 
						such terms as to costs or otherwise as may be just and 
						in such manner as it may direct. In other words, what 
						order 16 rule 7(1) of 0.1.47 permits is that the court 
						or judge may on his or its own motion or application 
						order such an amendment as it may appear to be just and 
						in such manner as he or it may direct. This purpose of 
						order 16 rule 7(1) of C. 1.47 has been made abundantly 
						clear by rule 8 of C. 1.47 which provides that: &quot;8 Where 
						the court makes an order giving a party leave to amend a 
						writ, pleading or other document, then if that party 
						does not amend the document in accordance with the order 
						before the expiration of the period specied for that 
						purpose in the order, or, if no period Is so specified 
						within fourteen days after the order is made the order 
						shall cease to have effect but without prejudice to the 
						power of the court to extend the period&quot; (my emphasis). 
						Order 16 rules 9(1), (2) and (3) of C.1.47 then provides 
						the method of amendment. Under rule 9(3) of C.1.47: &quot;A 
						writ, pleading or other document which has been amended 
						under this order shall be indorsed with a statement that 
						it has been amended, specifying the date on which it was 
						amended, the name of the judge who made the order 
						authorizing the amendment and the date of the order or, 
						if no such order was made, the number of the rule of 
						this order under which the amendment was made.&quot; The 
						evidence on record does not show that the learned trial 
						judge complied with order 16 rule 7(1) of C.1.47. In the 
						instant case, what the learned trial judge should have 
						done if he thought the pleadings raised an issue of 
						title to the disputed property, was to have ordered the 
						parties earlier on in the course of the proceedings or 
						during the trial to amend the writ of summons and or the 
						counterclaim to reflect that in accordance with order 16 
						rule 7(1) of C.1.47. His power or jurisdiction was to 
						order the amendment and not to make the amendment 
						himself as the trial judge did in the instant case. He 
						had no power and or jurisdiction to do that. The law is 
						that after service, a writ of summons can only be 
						amended either upon application or ordered to be so 
						amended by the court or judge in accordance with the 
						rules, namely order 16 rules 5(1) and 7(1) of C.1.47. 
						However, under order 16 rule 10 of C.1.47 the court has 
						the power or jurisdiction to amend clerical errors in 
						the proceedings or in a judgment or order either on its 
						own motion on notice to the parties or on an application 
						without an appeal. In the instant case, the amendment 
						the learned trial judge proprio motu made at the time he 
						was writing his judgment was not the type of amendment 
						envisaged under either order 16 rule 7(1) or under order 
						16 rule 10 of C.1.47. We are of the view therefore that, 
						that amendment was made or done without jurisdiction. It 
						was an irregular exercise of jurisdiction. The amendment 
						is therefore null and void and is accordingly set aside. 
						At page 246 of the ROA, the learned trial judge also 
						said this as one of the reasons why he entered judgment 
						in favour of the respondents: &quot;Besides the plaintiff 
						(i.e. in Suit No. E2/59/2006) was not clothed with the 
						capacity to institute that action at the time he did. 
						Reverend Nti admits he is not a trustee of the church. 
						That action was instituted in the name of the Trustees 
						of the church on 27th January 2006. He admits he 
						instituted that action before he obtained the Power of 
						Attorney which was given on 22nd March 2006.&quot; The 
						conclusion by the learned trial judge that the 
						plaintiffs in Suit No. E2/59/2006 had no capacity to 
						institute that action is with all due respect to the 
						learned trial judge wrong in law and on the facts. The 
						learned trial judge has himself admitted in his above 
						pronouncement that, that suit was initiated in the name 
						of the Trustees of the appellant church. It was 
						initiated on 27th February 2006 and not on 27th January 
						2006 as stated by the learned trial judge (see a copy of 
						that writ at page 322 of the ROA). The writ of summons 
						in that suit was filed and signed by the appellants 
						Lawyers &quot;Messrs Tackie Otoo &amp; Co.&quot; Reverend Nti's name 
						does not appear anywhere on that writ of summons. The 
						Power of Attorney (Exhibit 3) did not also authorize 
						Reverend Nti to institute that action and he did not 
						institute it. It is clear on the face of Exhibit 3 (see 
						page 299 of the ROA) that the Power of Attorney only 
						authorized Reverend Nti to among other things represent 
						the Trustees of the church in court and prosecute that 
						case for and on behalf of the Trustees and that is 
						exactly what he did in that suit. Exhibit 3 (the Power 
						of Attorney) stated as follows: &quot;Power of Attorney We 
						bishop Akwasi Asare Bediako, Rev. Richard Kwasi Owusu, 
						Rev. Ernest kwadwo Pianin, Mr. Oppong Peprah and Mr. 
						Alex Opoku Fordwour, who are the Trustees of the 
						Resurrection Power and Living Bread Ministries, do 
						hereby donate this Power of Attorney to Rev. Kwame 
						Bugyei Nti of House No. 50, Harbour Area, Takoradi in 
						the Western Region of Ghana to do any or all of the acts 
						and things following: 1 To represent us as the 
						plaintiffs in the case before the High Court Sekondi 
						titled: The Trustees of the Resurrection Power and 
						Living Bread Ministries VS. G. S. Ghana Ltd. 2 To 
						prosecute the case mentioned in paragraph 1 (supra) and 
						also defend any action which might arise in connection 
						thereto. 3 To execute legal documents including 
						affidavits which might be necessary for the exercise of 
						the powers bestowed on the Donee in paragraph 2 supra. 4 
						And we hereby agree to ratify and confirm anything done 
						by the Donee by virtue of this Deed. Dated at Sekondi 
						this 22nd day of March 2006. Signed&quot; The signatures of 
						the Donors appear below at the right side of Exhibit 3. 
						It is abundantly clear on the face of Exhibit 3 that 
						Reverend Nti was only empowered by the Power of Attorney 
						to represent the Donors in court and prosecute the case 
						for and on behalf of the said donors. There is no 
						evidence on record to show that it was Reverend Nti who 
						instituted the action in that case or that the Donors 
						were not the Trustees of the appellant church at the 
						time that suit was instituted or that the Trustees of 
						the church had no capacity to institute that action. The 
						learned trial judge did not therefore comprehend 
						properly the facts stated in Exhibit 3, also he 
						misdirected himself on the legal effect of the Power of 
						Attorney (Exhibit 3). We will therefore, sitting as 
						appellate judges in this appeal, interfere with that 
						finding and conclusion by rejecting same and accordingly 
						reverse it. We hold that the plaintiffs (now appellants 
						in this case) had locus standi or capacity to institute 
						Suit No. E2/59/2006 and that the trial judge erred in 
						finding and concluding to the contrary. The next issue 
						to consider is whether the respondents being 'strangers' 
						to the consent judgment in Suit No. E2/59/2006 had the 
						locus standi or capacity to seek to have it set aside. 
						The law is that before a person not a party to a 
						judgment or order can apply for an order or seek by a 
						fresh action to set aside a judgment for the reason of 
						fraud or for any other reason must first of all prove or 
						establish his or her capacity or locus standi to do so. 
						See the cases of Asahin Industries Co. Ltd. v. Kofifoh 
						Boat Building Co. Ltd. (1984-86) 1 G.L.R. 453; Gbago v. 
						Owusu (1972) 2 G.L.R. 252, State Insurance Corporation 
						v. Opoku-Darkwa (1974) 1 G.L.R. 439 and Lamptey v. 
						Hammond (supra). In the latter case of Lamptey v. 
						Hammond (supra) this court laid down the procedure a 
						person not a party to a judgment may use to establish 
						his or her locus standi or capacity to have the judgment 
						or order set aside as follows in holding (1) thereof: 
						&#8220;&#8230;.(1) there are two well established modes whereby a 
						person who was a stranger to a judgment or order which 
						adversely or injuriously affected him could have it set 
						aside. He could either obtain the leave of the defendant 
						in the case to use his name and then apply to the court 
						in the defendant's name to have the judgment set aside 
						or if for some reason he could not use the name of the 
						defendant, he could take out a summons in his own name 
						but then the summons should be served on both the 
						plaintiff and the defendant asking for the leave of the 
						court to set aside the judgment and to be allowed to 
						defend the action on such terms of indemnifying the 
						defendant as the judge might consider just.&quot; Similar 
						sentiments were expressed in all the above cited 
						judicial decisions. It is also trite law that where a 
						party is seeking to have a judgment or order of a 
						competent court of justice set aside for the reason of 
						or on the ground of fraud the procedure is that he must 
						do so by a writ of summons or by a fresh action. It is 
						equally trite law that a consent judgment may be set 
						aside for reasons of fraud, or mutual mistake or some 
						other ground upon which a court can set aside an 
						agreement. Thus, it was held in holding (1) in the case 
						of In re Arthur (dec'd) Abakah &amp; Another v. Atta-Haggan 
						&amp; Another C.A. (1992) 1 G.L.R. 430 as follows: &quot;(1) a 
						consent order made by a court is binding on a party and 
						it cannot be withdrawn if it is made as in this case as 
						a result of a consent by counsel with authority and full 
						knowledge of the facts. However, it can be set aside if 
						the party discovers that counsel had exceeded his 
						instructions and also on the ground of fraud, mutual 
						mistake or on some other ground upon which a court can 
						set aside an agreement&quot; (my emphasis). In the instant 
						case, the evidence shows that the respondents had 
						adopted the second mode of seeking to set aside the 
						consent judgment in Suit No. E2/59/2006 because they 
						issued the writ of summons in their own names and had 
						same served on both the defendant and the plaintiffs, 
						now appellants in this case and they issued a writ of 
						summons because they are alleging fraud in respect of 
						that consent judgment. We hold therefore that the 
						respondents had adopted the right procedure in their bid 
						to have that consent judgment set aside. We are also 
						satisfied that the respondents had sufficiently 
						established their locus standi or capacity in seeking to 
						have the consent judgment set aside. We do not buy the 
						opinion expressed by the learned trial judge that the 
						principle enunciated in Lamptey v. Hammond (supra) 
						applies to only default judgments. Perhnps the learned 
						trial judge expressed that opinion or was influenccd in 
						making that pronouncement on the basis of the fact that 
						Lamptey v. Hammond (supra) like all those other cases 
						referred to supra were default judgments but in our 
						opinion that is no reason to conclude that the rule 
						applies to only default judgments. Under order 43 rule 
						11 of the High court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2004 (C. 
						1.47) a party to a judgment or order may apply for an 
						order of stay of execution of the judgment or order or 
						&quot;for any other relief&quot; relating to that judgment or 
						order. By the use of the words &quot;other relief&quot; we 
						understand that phrase to include for instance the 
						relief of seeking to set aside that judgment or order. 
						Furthermore, by the use of the words 'judgment or order&quot; 
						without specifying the type of judgment or order, we 
						shall construe those words to include any judgment or 
						order&quot;, whether it is judgment after trial or a default 
						judgment. In our view therefore, the principle or rule 
						enunciated by the court of appeal in Lamptey v. Hammond 
						(supra) is applicable as a general principle of law to 
						all judgments or orders whether after trial or in 
						default given or made by a competent court of 
						jurisdiction. Order 43 rule 11 of C.1.47 provides: 
						&quot;Without prejudice to order 45 rule 15, a party against 
						whom a judgment or order has been given or made may 
						apply to the court for a stay of execution of the 
						judgment or order or other relief on the ground of 
						matters which have occurred since the date of the 
						judgment or order, and the court may by order grant the 
						relief, on such terms as it thinks just&quot; (my emphasis). 
						A consent judgment, depending on the facts and 
						circumstances of each case may be interlocutory or in 
						default of a party allowing it to be entered by his 
						default of appearance or a defence or it may be a 
						judgment after trial or by settlement out of court (i.e. 
						by agreement) and conclusive on the matters in 
						controversy between the parties and it is binding on 
						them. Parties or any of them to a consent judgment or 
						order cannot withdraw or resile from such a consent 
						judgment unless they are or he is able to establish 
						that, that consent judgment was arrived at by the lawyer 
						of the party without his (the party's) consent or that 
						the lawyer exceeded his authority and instructions or 
						that the judgment or order was obtained by fraud or 
						mutual mistake or on some other good and sufficient 
						reason or ground. See the case of In re Arthur (dec'd) 
						Abaka &amp; Another v. Atta-Hagan &amp; Another (supra). I will 
						next deal with the issue of fraud. It is not disputed 
						that fraud when proved vitiates every transaction 
						including a judgment of a court of law. See Amuzu v. 
						Oklikah (1998-99) S.C.G.L.R. 141 and Sasu v. Amua Sekyi 
						and Another (2003¬2004) 2 S.C.G.L.R. 742, S.C. An 
						allegation of fraud for all intents and purposes 
						connotes a criminal conduct for which the sanction may 
						include incarceration in prison. Therefore it is not 
						without doubt that it is for this reason that the law 
						requires that in civil cases fraud must be specifically 
						pleaded and the particulars given so that the person or 
						persons against whom it is alleged is given the 
						opportunity to prepare adequately to meet his accuser in 
						court and fight that allegation boot for boot. The law 
						also provides that the person who alleges fraud bears 
						the burden of strictly proving it to the extent of 
						requiring proof of it beyond all reasonable doubt 
						because of its quasi criminal nature and implications. 
						An assertion of fraud must not therefore be based on 
						mere flimsy or baseless accusations. See Okofo Estates 
						Ltd. v. Modern Signs Ltd. (supra) and Zotope v. 
						Hahormemme III (1987-88) 2 G.L.R. 681. Now, a careful 
						examination and evaluation of the particulars of fraud 
						pleaded in paragraph II of the respondents statement of 
						claim reveals, in our opinion that even if those 
						particulars are true they certainly fall short of 
						establishing fraud. The defendant had no legal 
						obligation to have informed the respondents of Suit No. 
						E2/59/2006 against it. The defendant was a tenant in the 
						disputed premises and the evidence suggests that it was 
						prepared to pay the rent to whoever was proved to be the 
						owner of the disputed building. The evidence shows that 
						before that suit was commenced, the defendant was paying 
						the rent to the respondents (see Exhibit C series at 
						page 174-182 of the ROA) until it received the letter 
						(Exhibit 6) from the appellants Lawyer warning and 
						instructing them to cease paying the rents to the 
						respondents. In that letter, the appellants lawyer had 
						made it clear to the defendant that the appellant church 
						was the owner of the whole of the SCOA building. In the 
						teeth of these facts the respondents cannot be right in 
						alleging that the defendant knew at the time of the 
						consent judgment that they (respondents) were the owners 
						of the disputed property. Besides, there is even 
						evidence on record showing that the respondents were in 
						fact aware of the action in Suit No. E2/59/2006. Thus in 
						his own evidence in chief at page 95 lines 6-7 of the 
						ROA the 1st respondent (plaintiff) made this admission 
						and revelation: &quot;In 2006 I went to collect rents and I 
						was told second defendant had taken them (i.e. 
						defendant) to court claiming that the house they (i.e. 
						defendant) occupied belonged to second defendant and not 
						me...&quot; The question is this: When 1st respondent was 
						told this what did he do? Was this not sufficient 
						information to have put the respondents upon further 
						inquiry from the defendant or from the appellant about 
						that action? We find that the respondents were aware of 
						Suit No. E2/59/2006. We are also satisfied that the 
						respondent failed to strictly prove fraud against the 
						defendant and the appellant. They also failed to prove 
						collusion between the defendant and the appellant. 
						According to counsel for the appellant in granting those 
						reliefs to the respondents the learned trial judge acted 
						without jurisdiction. Learned counsel for the appellant 
						cited the Supreme Court case of Dam v. Addo and Brothers 
						(1962) 2 G.L.R. 200 in support of his submission. On the 
						contrary learned counsel for the respondents sought 
						refuge under order 1 rule 1(2) of the High Court (Civil 
						Procedure) Rules, 2004 (C.1.47) to justify the learned 
						trial judge's action in granting those reliefs in favour 
						of the respondents, contending that the learned trial 
						judge out of abundance of caution amended the statement 
						of claim and the appellant's counterclaim to encapsulate 
						the consequential orders he subsequently made giving due 
						regard to the pleadings and the issues filed for 
						determination by the appellant. In the view of learned 
						counsel for the respondents the case of Dam v. Addo and 
						Brothers (supra) only prescribed the substitution of a 
						new case by the court so that case is distinguishable 
						from the facts of the instant case and that in the 
						instant case the respondents had established that even 
						without proof of fraud they had a reasonable defence to 
						the action in Suit No. E2/59/2006 and cited the case of 
						Adu v. Ankomah and others already referred to above in 
						this judgment, in support of his submission. As a point 
						of correction the learned trial judge did not amend the 
						pleadings i.e. statement of claim and Reply of the 
						respondent and the statement of defence and 
						counterclaim. What he proprio motu amended is the 
						endorsement on the writ of summons and the relief in the 
						counterclaim. Secondly, the issue of the respondents' or 
						Mr. Halifax Addo-Twurn's ownership of the disputed 
						property was not made an issue for trial in the summons 
						for directions. It is only the appellant's ownership of 
						the disputed property that was made an issue for the 
						trial as issue number VII in the summons for directions. 
						In effect the issue of Mr. Halifax Addo-Twum's or the 
						respondents' ownership of the disputed propriety or any 
						portion of it was not joined between the respondents and 
						the appellants. Thirdly, the usual phrase of &quot;Any other 
						issue(s) raised by the pleadings&quot; is completely absent 
						from the summons for Directions (see same at page 39-40 
						of the ROA). It is therefore incorrect as contended by 
						learned counsel for the respondents that the learned 
						trial judge amended the statement of claim and the 
						appellant's counterclaim out of abundance of caution in 
						order to encapsulate the consequential orders he 
						subsequently made giving due regard to the pleadings and 
						the issues filed for determination. We have already held 
						that the learned trial judge committed a jurisdictional 
						error in suo motu amending the writ of summons to 
						include a declaration of title to the disputed property 
						and subsequently giving judgment on that relief and also 
						proceeding to make or grant the so called consequential 
						orders all in favour of the respondents. His act 
						amounted to substituting a new case for the respondents. 
						That was a jurisdictional irregularity which renders 
						that declaration of title and those consequential orders 
						null and void. See Dam v. Addo and Brothers (supra). In 
						the recent case of Nana Ama Amponsah v. Franklyn Amoah 
						Nyamah (2009) 6 G.M.L.R. 1 where the High Court granted 
						title to a house to the respondent but which house was 
						not one of the reliefs asked for by the respondent in a 
						petition and cross- petition for divorce and other 
						reliefs and that was upheld by the Court of Appeal, the 
						Supreme Court held allowing the appeal inter alia that: 
						&quot;In as much as the Atwima Afiashebon house was not a 
						relief that any party made in the petition and 
						cross-petition of the respondent and the appellant 
						respectively a ruling on it was irrelevant for the 
						reliefs sought. This is because it is the duty of the 
						court to make pronouncements on the reliefs that a party 
						seeks. Since a judge who makes an order for a relief not 
						sought can be held to have exercised a jurisdictional 
						irregularity the decisions of both courts below in the 
						circumstances as to the ownership of the Atwima 
						Afiashebon house were irregular exercise of 
						jurisdiction... Thus as the Atwima Afiashebon house was 
						never an issue it was not within the courts mandate to 
						make pronouncement as to the ownership of it. Therefore 
						the Court of Appeal's decision declaring Ama Amporisah 
						as the owner of H/No. Plot 38 Block A was done without 
						jurisdiction and same is accordingly set aside...&quot; The 
						case of Dam v. Addo and Brothers (supra) was cited with 
						approval. See also Amoyaw v. Amoyaw (1999-2000) 2 G.L.R. 
						124, C.A. and Allotey v. Quacoe (1981) 1 G.L.R. 420, 
						S.C. In the instant case, no issue was joined between 
						the respondents and the appellant on the ownership of 
						the disputed house or any portion of it or a declaration 
						of title of same by the respondents or Mr. Halifax 
						Addo-Twum. In other words, the respondents never asked 
						for the relief of a declaration of title to the disputed 
						house or any part of it in their writ or pleadings so 
						the trial judge had no business amending the endorsement 
						of the writ to include that relief. It was not therefore 
						the duty of the learned trial court to make any 
						pronouncement on that issue. The respondents did not 
						also ask for a relief that the defendant should be 
						ordered to attorn tenant to them or that the court 
						should order the appellant to convey the disputed 
						property to them or that the court should order that any 
						rents paid into court should be paid to them. The 
						respondents did not even plead ownership of the whole or 
						the entire SCOA building. It is clear from the statement 
						of claim and their Reply that the respondents were 
						asserting or claiming that Mr. Halifax Addo¬Twum having 
						paid half of the purchase price of the disputed house 
						became owner of the offices section of the disputed 
						property and that after his death, they were entitled to 
						the portion of the building allegedly transferred to the 
						deceased by Exhibit A. But the learned trial judge 
						decreed ownership of the entire SCOA building in favour 
						of the respondents. It is our view that, that 
						declaration as well as the consequential orders made 
						therein tantamounted to the substitution of a new case 
						for the respondents and were made without jurisdiction 
						and are therefore null and void and are accordingly set 
						aside. Grounds (a) and (b) of the appeal accordingly 
						succeed. This brings me finally to a consideration of 
						grounds (c) and (d) of the appeal. Ground (c) is 
						complaining that the learned trial judge's holding that 
						the late Mr. Addo-Twum paid half of the purchase price 
						of the SCOA building and thereby made him the owner of 
						the disputed building is not supported by the evidence 
						on the record whilst ground (d) complains that the 
						learned trial Judge did not consider the appellant's 
						case adequately. Since ground (c) is complaining that 
						that finding and conclusion is against the weight of the 
						evidence on the road, this court is entitled to peruse 
						and examine the totality of the evidence on the record 
						taking into consideration the undisputed or admitted 
						facts in order to arrive at our own decision on the 
						matter. See Akuffo-Addo v. Catheline (supra). It is also 
						settled law that it is the appellant who bears the 
						burden to prove that the judgment is not supported by 
						the evidence on record. However, since it is the 
						respondents who had asserted that late Halifax Addo-Twum 
						paid half (i.e. ¢20,000,000.00) of the total purchase 
						price of forty million old cedis (¢40,000,000.00) of the 
						SCOA building and therefore became owner of part of that 
						building the burden of proof and persuasion rested on 
						them to prove that issue. This burden never shifted 
						until and unless the respondents had adduced sufficient 
						cogent and satisfactory prima facie evidence of that 
						issue. In other words, the respondents had the duty to 
						establish a prima facie case of Mr. Halifax Addo-Twum's 
						said half contribution of the purchase price. See 
						sections 11(1) and (2) and (4) of the Evidence Act, 1975 
						(N.R.C.D. 323). On the evidence on the record, the 
						respondents based that claim on the following; (1) that 
						Mr. Halifax Addo-Twum paid half of the purchase price of 
						the SCOA building; (2) that by virtue of (1) and Exhibit 
						A the offices and warehouse portions of the SCOA 
						building became the property of late Halifax Addo-Twum 
						and after his death it became the property of the 
						respondents, and (3) that during his lifetime late 
						Halifax Addo-Twum collected rents from the defendant in 
						respect of that portion of the disputed property. I must 
						concede that the respondents evidence on the above facts 
						has been corroborated by Rev. Bernard Atta-Boateng (Pwl). 
						However, in our opinion, a careful evaluation of the 
						totality of the evidence on the record reveals that the 
						respondents did not at the end of the trial establish on 
						a preponderance of the probabilities that late Halifax 
						Addo-Twum contributed or paid half of the purchase price 
						of the SCOA building and became the legal owner of any 
						portion of the SCOA building. We are of the view that 
						Pwl is a fraudulent character who came to court to give 
						evidence in support of the respondents in an attempt to 
						absolve himself from his fraudulent misdeeds in the 
						whole affair in relation to the purchase of the SCOA 
						building. In the first place, apart from the oral 
						assertions or testimonies of the respondents and Pwl 
						that late Halifax Addo-Twum paid half (i.e. 
						¢20,OOO,OOO.00) of the purchase price of the disputed 
						property, there is no documentary evidence to support or 
						corroborate that claim or those assertions which have 
						been denied by the appellant. On the contrary, there is 
						documentary evidence on record which establishes that it 
						was the appellant church which alone bought the disputed 
						property. That documentary evidence is the Deed of 
						Assignment (Exhibit E). Quite interestingly, even though 
						Pwl in his evidence in court insisted that Halifax 
						Addo-Twum paid half of the forty million old cedis 
						(¢40,000,000.00) being the purchase price of the 
						disputed property he tendered Exhibit E which seriously 
						and fatally contradicts his testimony. Exhibit E 
						completely negatives the respondents and Pwl's 
						testimonies that Halifax Addo-Twum paid half of the 
						purchase price of the SCOA building and because of that 
						he became the owner of the offices and warehouse portion 
						of the SCOA building. No receipt whatsoever was produced 
						and tendered in evidence to support or corroborate that 
						claim of the respondents. Again, the receipts for 
						payment of the purchase price of the disputed property 
						tendered during the trial as Exhibits1A -1E (found at 
						pages 295--296 of the ROA), which are all in the name of 
						the appellant church seriously and fatally contradicts 
						and dents the claims of the respondents and that of Pwl 
						that Halifax Addo-Twum paid half of the purchase price 
						of the disputed property. In fact in his judgment, the 
						learned trial judge conceded that there is no 
						documentary evidence to support or corroborate the 
						respondents and Pw 1 's evidence that Addo-Twum paid 
						half of the purchase price of the disputed property (see 
						page 260 lines 17-19 of the ROA). Therefore, in our view 
						in the light of Exhibits E and1A-1E, the assertions of 
						the respondents and Pwl that Halifax Addo¬Twum paid 
						¢20,000,000.00 being half of the purchase price of the 
						disputed property should have been rejected by the 
						learned trial judge and accordingly we hereby totally 
						reject these assertions. Our finding and conclusion on a 
						proper examination and evaluation of the totality of the 
						evidence on the record especially having regard to the 
						undisputed facts on the face of Exhibits E and1A-1E is 
						that late Halifax Addo-Twum did not contribute half 
						(i.e. ¢20,000,000.00) of the purchase price of the 
						disputed building or property. We find that it was the 
						appellant church which alone bought and paid for the 
						entire or the whole SCOA building at Takoradi. Exhibit A 
						on which the respondents also relied on to establish 
						their claim is a worthless piece of information and it 
						is not worth the paper on which it is written. Exhibit A 
						which was addressed to the Manger of S.G.S. (Ghana) Ltd. 
						and copied to late Halifax Addo-Twum and was written by 
						Pwl reads in part: &quot;TRANSFER OF S. G. S. offices And 
						Warehouse in Takoradi On behalf of the Board of the 
						above church I will like to inform you that the building 
						of the S.G.S. office and warehouse, Takoradi has been 
						transferred to Mr. Halifax Addo-Twum of Halifax 
						Construction Ltd., P. 0. Box 172, Takoradi. Mr. Halifax 
						is now the owner of the said office and warehouse. 
						Contact him for any information arrangements or you 
						would like to make. Thanks. Yours faithfully, (Signed) 
						Re: Bernard Atta-Boateng Head pastor CC: Mr. Halifax 
						Addo-Twum CC:The Manager Halifax Construction Ltd. 
						S.G.S.(GH) Ltd. P .O. BOX 172 Takoradi.&#8221; Takoradi 
						Exhibit A is dated 6th February 1997 whilst the Deed of 
						Assignment - Exhibit E is dated 30th December 1994. By 
						virtue of Exhibit E, the whole of the disputed property 
						became the property of the Resurrection Power and Living 
						Bread Ministries International (the appellant herein). 
						Therefore, it was only the Trustees of the appellant 
						church that is clothed with the legal power and 
						authority to deal with or transfer the disputed property 
						or any part of it to any person or corporate body. The 
						Western Region Board of the appellant church or Pwl 
						therefore had no legal power capacity and authority or 
						right to transfer any portion of the disputed property 
						to late Halifax Addo-Twum. There is completely no 
						documentary evidence to support or confirm the 
						information carried by Exhibit A that the offices and 
						warehouse of the SCOA building had been transferred to 
						Halifax Addo-Twum by the Trustees of the appellant 
						church. But if the point is made that Exhibit A is the 
						document or Deed of Transfer itself, then the 
						respondents cannot rely on it to establish Mr. 
						Addo-Twum's claim of ownership to that section of the 
						disputed property. This is because Exhibit A which 
						touches and concerns land has not been stamped in 
						accordance with the Stamp Act nor has it been registered 
						in accordance with section 24(1) of the Land Title 
						Registry Act, 1962 (Act 122). Exhibit A cannot therefore 
						form the basis of a judicial decision. The learned trial 
						judge therefore erred in law in relying on Exhibit A to 
						declare title of the disputed property or any part of it 
						in favour of the respondents. See Thompson v. Mensah 
						(1957) 3 W.L.R. 240, A.C., Asare v. Brobbey (1971) 2 
						G.L.R. 331, Hammond v. Odoi (1982-83) 2 G.L.R. 1215 and 
						Nti v. Mantse (2008) 15 (G.M.L.R. 185. There is even no 
						evidence including the facts recited in Exhibit A that 
						the said Exhibit A was executed by Rev. Atta¬Boatend (Pwl) 
						and late Halifax Addo-Twum as a deed of conveyance of 
						the portion of the SCOA building in favour of the 
						deceased. Thus, if Exhibit A has any value at all at 
						best it is a mere letter conveying a piece of 
						information but an information can either be true or 
						false depending on the facts of each case. The facts in 
						the instant case establish that the information conveyed 
						by Exhibit A is false to the extent that there is 
						completely no evidence that the offices and warehouse 
						section of the SCOA building have been transferred to 
						the late Halifax Addo-Twum by the Trustees of the 
						appellant church. The respondents also assert that late 
						Addo-Twum collected rents from the defendant during his 
						lifetime and that the respondents stepped in after Mr. 
						Halifax Addo-Twum's death to collect these rents and 
						therefore that this further shows that late Halifax 
						Addo-Twum became part owner of the SCOA building. The 
						evidence on record establishes that that assertion is 
						partly correct and partly false. For example in Exhibit 
						6 (page 310 of the ROA), the appellant's solicitors 
						(Messrs Tackie Otoo &amp; Co.) made this admission: &quot;WesternLaw 
						Chambers 3B/20 Maxwell Rd Valley P.O. Box 657 Sekondi, 
						Ghana, W/A 31-10-05 The Managing Director S.G.S. (Ghana) 
						Ltd. Accra Dear Sir, Re: The Takoradi Office of S.G.S. 
						(Ghana) Ltd. Payment of Rent. We write for and on behalf 
						of the Resurrection Power and Living Bread Ministries: 
						the Bona Fide owners of your Takoradi office. As you are 
						aware in the past all rents accruing from your Takoradi 
						office was collected by Mr. Halifax Addo-Twum and after 
						his death by his widow. The couple were collecting the 
						rent in respect of the demised premises by virtue of an 
						arrangement between our clients and the said couple. We 
						are instructed to inform you that the authorization 
						given to the couple to be collecting the rent has been 
						withdrawn and therefore henceforth all rents should be 
						paid to our clients at its Takoradi office... Yours 
						faithfully, (Signed) Solicitor for Resurrection Power 
						And Living Bread Ministries.&quot; Consequently, on the basis 
						of the admission by the appellant church contained in 
						Exhibit 6 that in the past all rents in respect of the 
						offices of the S.G.S. (Ghana) Ltd. in Takoradi were 
						collected by Mr. Halifax Addo-Twum, We find that between 
						1994-1997 i.e. from 1994 until the death of Addo-Twum in 
						1997, the deceased was collecting the rents in respect 
						of the portion of the SCOA building occupied by the 
						defendant herein. We find however that there is no 
						conclusive and proved evidence on record on how much 
						rent Mr. Addo-Twum collected from 1994 until his death 
						in 1997. There is also no satisfactory evidence to 
						support the respondents' claim that late Halifax 
						Addo-Twum collected those rents because he was the owner 
						of the portion of the premises occupied by the defendant 
						or that it was because he paid half of the purchase 
						price of the entire SCOA building. We therefore reject 
						those claims and or assertions as not supported by the 
						evidence on the record. On the contrary, there is 
						evidence which we accept that late Halifax Addo-Twum 
						collected those rents with the authorization and 
						approval of the appellant church and that he collected 
						those rents as a set-off of an amount of eight million 
						old cedis (¢8,000,000.00) which he gave to the appellant 
						church as financial assistance through Pwl towards the 
						payment of the purchase price of the SCOA building. See 
						Exhibit 6 (supra) and Exhibit B. Exhibit B shows clearly 
						that because Halifax Addo-Twum was receiving rents until 
						his death in 1997 that prompted the respondents to 
						continue to collect those rents and to enter into a new 
						tenancy agreement in respect of the rent with the 
						defendant. It is also clear that it was on the basis of 
						Exhibits A and B that the respondents continued 
						collecting the rents from the defendant after the death 
						of Addo-Twum in 1997. Thus, paragraphs 2 &amp; 3 of Exhibit 
						B state as follows: &quot;We refer to a letter dated 6th 
						February 1997 addressed to you by the Resurrection Power 
						and Living Bread Church informing you that our client 
						had purchased the above property. Our client is prepared 
						to enter into afresh tenancy with you in respect of the 
						above property with effect from 1st March 1997.&quot; The 
						letter &quot;dated Oh February 1997&quot; referred to in Exhibit B 
						is Exhibit A. The Exhibit C series i.e. Exhibits C1 - C9 
						(pages 274¬283 of ROA) further show that between 
						1997-2004 it was the respondent who collected the rents 
						from the defendant. But it is clear on the evidence on 
						the record that the appellant church never accepted the 
						late Halifax Addo-Twum or the administrators of his 
						estate (respondents) as the owners of the portion of the 
						SCOA building the defendant occupied. This is so because 
						there is documentary evidence from Exhibit 2 (page 298 
						of ROA) that on 8th February 1995 i.e. even during the 
						lifetime of Halifax Addo-Twum, the appellant church 
						wrote to the defendant informing the defendant they were 
						to pay a monthly rent of ¢350,000.00 and that the 
						defendant should pay two years advance rent of eight 
						million, four hundred thousand old cedis 
						(¢8,400,000.00). There is also further evidence in 
						Exhibit 2A (page 277 of ROA) that in July 1995 the 
						appellant church had or was negotiating with a company 
						called Supermaritime (Ghana) Ltd. to rent the offices 
						and warehouse portion of the SCOA building i.e. the 
						portion occupied by the defendant company to it. The 
						facts in Exhibits 2, 2A and 6 therefore show or 
						establish a reasonable inference that between 1994-1997 
						it was the appellant church which had effective and 
						actual control and possession of the entire SCOA 
						building or the disputed property and that it was the 
						appellant church which authorized late Halifax Addo-Twum 
						and after his death the respondents herein to collect 
						the rents from the defendant and not that Addo-Twum or 
						the respondents collected those rents as owners of the 
						offices and warehouse section of the disputed property, 
						and we so find and accordingly conclude. Further in a 
						letter dated 11th November, 2006 from the appellants' 
						solicitors to the respondents solicitors - Exhibit F 
						(page 294 of the ROA) the appellant gave reasons why it 
						permitted the late Addo-Twum to collect the rents from 
						the defendant. Paragraphs 3 and 4 of Exhibit F read as 
						follows: &quot;Dear Sir, Re: S. G. S. Premises in SCOA 
						Building Our instructions are that our client is the 
						sole assignee in respect of the whole of the said 
						premises (please see attachment). We are further 
						instructed that when the premises was put out for sale, 
						the said Halifax Addo-Twum gave our client 08 million as 
						financial assistance to make up the purchase price and 
						that to enable Halifax Addo-Twum recoup his 08 million 
						and all accruals thereon our client permitted him in his 
						lifetime and his wife for sometime after the demise to 
						collect rent from the tenants of our client who were 
						occupying parts of the premises.&quot; Paragraph 3 of Exhibit 
						F is true because it is supported by Exhibit E - the 
						Deed of Assignment. Paragraph 4 of Exhibit F is also 
						supported by the facts established by Exhibits1A-1E,2&amp; 
						2A, 6 and Exhibit B. Again, that is also supported by 
						the fact that there is completely no evidence to support 
						the claim that Addo-Twum paid half of the purchase price 
						of the SCOA building. It is further supported by the 
						absence of evidence documentary or oral about how much 
						rent Addo-Twum collected during his lifetime. In our 
						view in the absence of evidence to the contrary, we can 
						safely find and conclude that whatever rent late 
						Addo-Twum collected was meant to set off the eight 
						million cedis (¢8,000.00) Mr. Addo-Twum had assisted the 
						appellant church financially to purchase the SCOA 
						building. Thus, it is not surprising that late Halifax 
						Addo-Twum was putting pressure on Pwl, according to Pwl 
						himself to give him a receipt, obviously in respect of 
						the amount he advanced to Pwl to enable Pwl buy the 
						disputed property when he got to know that Pwl was going 
						on transfer from Takoradi. We think it is reasonable to 
						infer and we do infer that it was under that intense and 
						persistent pressure for a receipt that Pwl wrote Exhibit 
						A. This finding and conclusion finds support in Pwl 's 
						own evidence in which he tried to explain the 
						circumstances leading to his giving Exhibit A to Halifax 
						Addo-Twum. At page 116 of ROA Pwl testified inter alia, 
						as follows: &quot;... When I came back (from general meeting 
						of Senior Pastors at headquarters in Kumasi), I had a 
						meeting with the Takoradi branch and I listed and gave 
						to them the things I did and bought in the name of the 
						church. This Included the SCOA building. It was because 
						of that I wrote Exhibit A to show the portion that 
						belonged to Halifax Addo-TwuTn so that whether I was 
						there or not it would be known that it is his. My last 
						meeting with the elders was in March. At that meeting 
						Halifax Addo-Twum demands I get him a receipt. I told 
						him I could not give him a receipt until a demarcation 
						was done. I gave him Exhibit A to enable him deal with 
						S.G.S.&quot; (my emphasis). It is not clear what Pwl wanted 
						to demarcate when Exhibit A stated clearly that it was 
						the offices and the warehouse portion of the SCOA 
						building that belonged to Halifax Addo-Twum. The most 
						reasonable inference we draw from this evidence is that 
						it was because at that time Halifax Addo-Twum had not 
						completely set off or exhausted the eight million cedis 
						(¢8,000,000.00) and because Pwl was due for transfer 
						that he (Mr. Addo-Twum) wanted a receipt for his 
						¢8,000,000.00 so that he would not have any problem with 
						Pwl's successor as to the collection of the rents from 
						the defendant towards the full liquidation of his 
						¢8,000,000.00. Besides, Exhibit E (Deed of Assignment) 
						overwhelmingly serves as an insurmountable block to 
						whatever claim of ownership late Halifax Addo-Twum or 
						the respondents herein to have in respect of the 
						disputed building or any portion of it. The law is that 
						facts recited in a written document are conclusively 
						presumed to be true as between parties to it and all 
						persons claiming through them. It is also trite law that 
						where a party, by his own statement, act or omission 
						intentionally and deliberately caused or permitted 
						another person to believe a thing to be true and to act 
						upon such belief, the truth of that thing shall be 
						conclusively presumed against that party or his 
						successors in interest in any proceedings between that 
						party or his successors in interest and such relying 
						person or his successors in interest. This legal 
						position concerning written documents is provided 
						statutorily in sections 25(1) and 26 of the Evidence 
						Act, 1975 (N.R.C.D. 323). Sections 25(1) and (2) and 26 
						of N.R.C.D. 323 provide. &quot;25(1)Except as otherwise 
						provided by law, including a rule of equity, the facts 
						recited in a written document are conclusively presumed 
						to be true as between the parties to the instrument or 
						their successors in interest. (2) This section does not 
						apply to the recital of consideration. 26 Except as 
						otherwise provided by law including a rule of equity, 
						when a party has by his own statement, act or omission 
						intentionally and deliberately caused or permitted 
						another person to believe a thing to be true and to act 
						upon such belief, the truth of that hung shall be 
						conclusively presumed against that party or his 
						successors in interest in any proceedings between that 
						party or his successors in interest and such relying 
						person or his successors in interest.&quot; Late Halifax 
						Addo-Twum supported Rev. Bernard Atta-Boateng (Pwl) to 
						sign and execute the Deed of Assignment (Exhibit E) by 
						signing Exhibit E as a witness. There is evidence on 
						record that Mr. Addo-Twum was literate i.e. he could 
						read and write. The recitals in Exhibit E are that the 
						original Lessees of the SCOA building, SCOA Ghana Ltd. 
						had assigned its unexpired or residue interest in the 
						SCOA building to the Resurrection Power and Living Bread 
						Ministries International for a consideration (or 
						purchase price) of forty million old cedis 
						(¢40,000,000.00). Exhibit E has described SCOA Ghana 
						Ltd. as the vendor and the Resurrection Power and Living 
						Bread Ministries International as the purchaser. No 
						mention whatsoever is made in Exhibit E of Mr. Halifax 
						Addo-Twum as either a co-purchaser or co-assignee of the 
						disputed property or any part of it or that he has an 
						interest of any kind in the SCOA building. Mr. Halifax 
						Addo¬Twum must have read and appreciated the contents of 
						Exhibit E before he signed it as a witness. The law is 
						that a person of sound mind and full age who signs a 
						written document is bound by it whether he read it or 
						understood it or not. There is no evidence that Mr. 
						Halifax Addo-Twum (deceased) was either a minor or of 
						unsound mind at the time he signed Exhibit E as a 
						witness. There is no evidence whatsoever that late 
						Addo-Twum raised any objection to the recitals of 
						Exhibit E at anytime during his lifetime. The 
						respondents did not plead and prove that Exhibit E is 
						tainted with fraud or that for any sufficient reason 
						Exhibit E is not valid. On the contrary, Exhibit E on 
						its face has been stamped and registered. In consequence 
						in the absence of evidence invalidating Exhibit E the 
						late Halifax Addo¬Twum and his successors in interest 
						are bound by Exhibit E. By intentionally and 
						deliberately signing Exhibit E and causing the appellant 
						church to believe that it is the sole purchaser or 
						assignee of the entire SCOA building and acting on that 
						belief by writing Exhibits 6, and F. Mr. Halifax 
						Addo-Twum and his successors in interest to wit the 
						respondents herein are estopped by conduct from 
						challenging the appellant church's title or ownership of 
						the entire SCOA building. The facts recited in Exhibit E 
						are conclusively presumed to be true as between the 
						appellant church and late Mr. Halifax Addo-Twum and his 
						successors in interest the respondents herein. Exhibit E 
						created an estoppel by a written document (statutory 
						estoppel) and binds Mr. Halifax Addo-Twum (deceased) and 
						his successors in interest and the respondents herein 
						and secondly, the legal effect of late Halifax 
						Addo-Twum's act in signing Exhibit E and failing to 
						raise any objection to the recitals therein, is that 
						Halifax Addo-Twum and all persons claiming through him 
						are statutorily estopped from asserting ownership of the 
						SCOA building or any part of it. The respondents herein 
						have failed to establish that this case falls under the 
						exception created under section 25(2) of N.R.C.D. 323. 
						See the recent case of Kusi &amp; Kusi v. Bonsu Civil Appeal 
						No. JA/14/2009 dated 29th April, 2010, S.C. In that case 
						the defendant was a co-signatory to a petition to the 
						Asantehene in respect of a portion of land at Adum, as 
						family property that was originally compulsorily 
						acquired by the Government of Ghana but was subsequently 
						released to the family. The reconveyance Leasehold was 
						executed in the name of the defendant with the knowledge 
						of the family. The defendant took advantage of that and 
						started dealing with the land as if it were his 
						self-acquired property including using it to obtain a 
						loan from one Kofi Aboagye. When the family got wind of 
						this they redeemed the land from Mr. Aboagye but the 
						reconveyance Lease of the property still remained in the 
						name of the defendant. Unperturbed the defendant again 
						took advantage of that and pledged the land to one Grace 
						Nsiah. When Grace Nsiah died and her customary successor 
						applied to the High Court for Letters of Administration 
						in respect of the estate of Grace Nsiah and listed the 
						disputed property in the inventory, the plaintiff, now 
						head of the defendant's family caveated the application 
						and then took out a writ of summons claiming title to 
						the land as family property. The High Court dismissed 
						the plaintiff's action. On appeal to the Court of Appeal 
						the Court of Appeal reversed the High Court's decision 
						for the reason that the reconveyancc Lease was not 
						registered in accordance with section 24(1) of Act 122. 
						On further appeal to the Supreme Court, the Supreme 
						Court held, inter alia, that: (1) Exhibit B (the 
						petition to Asantehene that was co-signed by the 
						defendant created an estoppel by written document and 
						was also binding on the defendant, (2) that the legal 
						effect of that declaration against his interest was that 
						the defendant and all persons claiming through him were 
						estopped from asserting otherwise and, (3) that the 
						defendant failed to establish that his case fell under 
						the exceptions created under section 25(2) of N.R.C.D. 
						323. In the instant case, late Halifax Addo-Twum signed 
						Exhibit E against his interest. He and all persons 
						claiming through him are all estopped from asserting 
						ownership of any portion of the SCOA building. In effect 
						at the close of the trial aside other pieces of evidence 
						on the record entitling the appellant church for 
						judgment in its favour, Exhibit E (the Deed of 
						Assignment) stood out as a solid and impenetrable rock 
						against the claims of late Halifax Addo-Twum and all 
						persons including the respondents herein claiming 
						through him. We therefore agree with learned counsel for 
						the appellant that the learned trial judge did not give 
						adequate consideration to the case of the appellant. On 
						the facts and evidence we conclude that the respondents 
						had no good or reasonable defence to the action in Suit 
						No. E2/59/2006 to warrant giving them leave to join that 
						suit. The appeal on grounds (c) and (d) also succeed. In 
						conclusion the appeal succeeds and is allowed on grounds 
						(a), (b), (c) and (d). The judgment of the learned trial 
						judge together with all orders made therein is hereby 
						set aside. In its place judgment is entered in favour of 
						the appellant on its counterclaim. Interest on the 
						$8,000.00 rent collected by the respondents after they 
						had been warned from receiving same by the appellant is 
						granted to take effect from the date of the trial
