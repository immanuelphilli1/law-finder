						<span style="font-family: Arial">ARYEETEY, J.A.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A brief background to 
						this appeal is as follows: The late Comfort Mateko was 
						the sister of the late Yodjo who died in 1953 leaving 
						behind his four children namely the plaintiff/appellant 
						and his three sisters. Comfort Mateko, whose only child 
						was the first defendant, took care of her deceased 
						sister&#8217;s children and played the role of their foster 
						mother. It is the case of the plaintiff that before the 
						death of Yodjo, his mother, the late Comfort Mateko and 
						her late mother had jointly purchased a piece of land on 
						which they built three rooms. The late Mateko 
						customarily adopted the plaintiff and his siblings as 
						her own children. Her adopted children helped her in her 
						trading and she was able to increase the rooms in the 
						house to seven with the plaintiff helping physically 
						with the construction work. Thereafter the late Mateko 
						lived in the house with the plaintiff and his sisters 
						until 1987 when she suffered a stroke, which stopped her 
						from engaging in any gainful employment. It is the case 
						of the plaintiff that when the late Comfort Mateko lay 
						on sick bed the first defendant connived with her son, 
						the late Winfred Ofoe Semaha, who was the original 
						second defendant and sold the house in dispute to the 
						third defendant without the knowledge and consent of the 
						head and all members of their family.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The family got to know 
						of the fraudulent transaction in November, 1992 and that 
						prompted the head of the family and two principal 
						members of the family to approach the late Mateko on her 
						sick bed and questioned her about the sale of the house. 
						She expressed surprise and denied any knowledge about 
						sale of the house. When the first defendant was asked to 
						give explanation for her conduct she could not do so. 
						When Comfort Mateko died the family had the information 
						that the house in dispute had indeed been sold to the 
						third defendant. Meanwhile the plaintiff was appointed 
						successor to the late Comfort Mateko at a general 
						meeting of the family and authorised to write to the 
						third defendant about his unlawful occupation of the 
						house in dispute. The third defendant refused to accept 
						the letter on the basis that he had nothing to do with 
						the plaintiff's head of family. The plaintiff on his own 
						behalf and on behalf of his family first took action 
						against the third defendant for Declaration of Title and 
						Recovery of possession of House No. B.20, Asesewa as 
						depicted in the proceedings of the Somanya District 
						Magistrate Grade 1 Court recorded at page 119 of the 
						record of appeal. The Statement of Claim, which the 
						plaintiff filed in that case reads:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;1. Plaintiff is the 
						eldest son of the late Comfort Mateko Matey the original 
						owner of House Number B 20 at Asesewa and lives at 
						Manyakpongunor.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2. The defendant is a 
						Northerner and presently living at Asesewa.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3. Comfort Mateko now 
						deceased was a mother of many descendants living in 
						various places including House No. B 20, Asesewa. That 
						she died in January, 1993 at Manyakpongunor.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">4. That defendant is 
						never a member of the Matey Oddah family of which 
						Comfort Mateko formed part but has now trespassed into 
						the house and started renovation on the house.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">5. That when the family 
						noticed the defendants trespass into the house, the 
						plaintiff was empowered to write a warning to the 
						defendant and invite him to appear before the family so 
						as to know how the defendant got into the house.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">6. That the letter was 
						accordingly written and served on the defendant by the 
						plaintiff, the defendant refused accepting the letter 
						saying that he has no letter writing with the family.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">7. That by defendants 
						behaviour I believe the same dubious deal might have 
						happened or is happening somewhere that if steps are not 
						taken to check the situation it will cause a very great 
						harm to the family and mostly the plaintiff &quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendant who 
						happens to be the third defendant/respondent in this 
						appeal filed a defence denying the claim of the 
						plaintiff. An interesting development in the case was an 
						application for joinder as co-defendant by Emmanuel Narh 
						Matey who described himself as head of the plaintiff's 
						family. His affidavit in support of the application for 
						joinder is as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;I, Emmanuel Narh Matey 
						of Manya-Kpongunor make oath and say as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1. That I am the 
						deponent herein.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2. That I have got to 
						know of this Suit (Counsel will refer to all the 
						processes filed)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3. That I am the head 
						of the Matey Oddah family of Manya-Kpongunor on whose 
						behalf the plaintiff claims he brings this action.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">4. That the plaintiff 
						is not the head of family and he has not my authority to 
						bring this action.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">5. That I know one 
						Comfort Mateko who was my sister sold the house, House 
						No. B 20, Asesewa, subject matter of this suit to the 
						defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">6. That the said house 
						was the self acquired property of Comfort Mateko. That 
						the action is brought in bad faith,</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">7. That my title as the 
						head of family is at stake in this suit&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The record of 
						proceedings of the Somanya District Court Grade 1 dated 
						28th April, 1994 shows at page 120 of the record of 
						appeal that after the application had been moved on 
						behalf of the applicant the plaintiff's response was to 
						inform the court that he had brought to court one 
						Otseame Donkor, an elder in his family who wished to 
						attempt an out of court settlement in the case. 
						Applicant's counsel objected to what he perceived as 
						interference in the action &quot;because all along the 
						plaintiff has been disturbing the peace of mind of the 
						defendant in the enjoyment of the property.&#8221; 
						Subsequently the court ruled that &quot;As the plaintiff has 
						expressed the intention of himself and elders of 
						settling this action outside court, then the action is 
						otiose and hereby struck out.&#8221; The court awarded 
						¢30,000.00 costs in favour of the defendant. On 2nd 
						April, 1996 after the death of the head of family, 
						Emmanuel Narh Matey the plaintiff/appellant as 
						&#8220;successor of the late Comfort Mateko suing for himself 
						and on behalf of Yodjo descendants&#8221; filed a writ of 
						summons in Odumase-Krobo circuit court claiming for the 
						following reliefs:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;(a) Declaration of 
						title to House No. B 20 at Asesewa, which 1st and 2nd 
						defendants unlawfully sold to the 3rd defendant without 
						the prior consent and knowledge of the head of family.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) An order of the 
						court to declare the sale of the house No. B 20, Asesewa 
						which 1st and 2nd defendants sold unlawfully to 3rd 
						defendant, null and void.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) An order of the 
						court to compel the 3rd defendant to return all 
						documents pertaining to House No. B 20, Asesewa to the 
						plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d) Perpetual 
						Injunction restraining the defendants, their agents, 
						workmen or servants from interfering with the House No. 
						B 20, Asesewa.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(e) General Damages.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Meanwhile the second 
						defendant died and upon application his sister, Ruth 
						Ogbo Semaha was substituted as the second defendant 
						which is not reflected in the title of the case. Also 
						the first defendant could not testify in court on 
						account of ill health.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendants&#8217; version 
						of the case is that the late Comfort Mateko did not buy 
						the plot of land jointly with the plaintiff&#8217;s mother, 
						Yodjo. Also, they deny Comfort Mateko ever adopting the 
						plaintiff and his three sisters as her children even 
						though she brought them up and cared for them. She built 
						the rooms in the house, which she never shared among her 
						daughter, the plaintiff and his three sisters. It was 
						the late Comfort Mateko herself who sold the house in 
						dispute to the third defendant who immediately went into 
						possession and carried out extensive renovation works. 
						The third defendant counterclaimed for Declaration of 
						Title and &#8220;Perpetual Injunction against the plaintiff 
						and his agents, assigns, workman etc. from interfering 
						with the said house No. B 20 Asesewa in whatsoever 
						manner.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial circuit court 
						dismissed the plaintiff&#8217;s claim in its entirety and gave 
						the third defendant judgment in respect of his 
						counterclaim. The plaintiff appealed and filed three 
						grounds of appeal namely:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">i.&nbsp; The judgment is 
						against the weight of evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">ii. The learned trail 
						judge was biased and wrong in preferring the evidence of 
						Ruth Ogbo Semaha and Rev. W.K. Semaha, not members of 
						the plaintiff&#8217;s family to that of the head of family, 
						George Mate.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">iii. The learned judge 
						was wrong in admitting exhibit 3, which was not pleaded 
						and relying heavily on it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">His additional grounds 
						of appeal are so follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) The learned judge 
						was wrong and biased in accepting exhibit 4, described 
						as conveyance, which was not registered and thumb 
						printed without a jurat.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) The learned judge 
						showed bias when he declared in his judgment as follows: 
						&#8220;How much can a kenkey seller make in a town like 
						Asesewa to enable her feed herself and leave some money 
						to undertake a building project&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) The learned trial 
						judge was wrong in law then he held that H/No. B 20, 
						Asesewa which was sold to the 3rd defendant was valid, 
						in the face of the overwhelming evidence on record that 
						the rooms in the house were shared to Plaintiff and his 
						three sisters and the 1st defendant for which customary

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I would follow the same 
						order pursued by counsel for the appellant in his 
						written statement of the appellant's case. I take ground 
						(ii) of the original grounds of appeal first, namely: 
						&#8220;The learned trial judge was biased and wrong in 
						preferring the evidence of Ruth Ogbo Semaha and Rev. 
						W.K. Semaha, not members of the plaintiff&#8217;s family to 
						that of the head of family, George Mate.&#8221; In his written 
						submissions counsel for the appellant sounds as if the 
						case was pursued along family ownership of the property 
						in dispute. However, a cursory look at the description 
						of the plaintiff in the writ of summons reveals that he 
						portrays himself as &#8220;successor of the late Comfort 
						Mateko suing for himself and on behalf of Yodjo 
						descendants&#8221;. That means the interest of his family is 
						not as stake. So far as he was concerned those who have 
						interest in the disputed property are himself, his 
						siblings and their descendants. He did not include the 
						only daughter of the late Comfort Mateko and her 
						descendants. In any case what the witnesses mentioned in 
						the ground (ii) of the grounds of appeal related to 
						ownership of the land by the late Comfort Mateko and the 
						sale by her. In his judgment the learned circuit judge 
						took time to examine the testimonies of all the 
						witnesses before him in relation to the issues for 
						trial. He gave ample reasons why he preferred the 
						evidence of the defendants' witnesses to that of the 
						plaintiff's witnesses. At pages 105 and 106 of the 
						record of appeal we see the carefulness with which the 
						learned circuit judge examined the evidence of the 
						plaintiff's witnesses before he came out with his 
						conclusions. He states in his judgment as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Mr. George Mate, P.W.3 
						who described himself as head of family said in his 
						evidence that both Comfort Mateko and Yodjo jointly 
						bought and put up a two room house on it. He said before 
						they put up the house they offered a sheep and a bottle 
						of Schnapps to the Matey Oddah family that they were 
						putting the house under the care of the family. The 
						family accepted the offer and slaughtered the sheep. 
						After the two rooms have been put up the family divided 
						the rooms and gave one to Mateko and another to Yodjo. 
						He stated that Yodjo died not long afterwards. According 
						to P.W.3 the house in dispute is family property.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I think that I would 
						like to state here and now that there is no evidence 
						that the property in dispute is family property. I do 
						not believe the evidence of P.W.3 that as soon as Mateko 
						and Yodjo put up the house they gave it to the family 
						and that from that day the structure became a family 
						house. P.W.3 did not state why Mateko and Yodjo found it 
						necessary to give the house to the family. If they did 
						that then it is most unusual. I do not however believe 
						that Mateko and Yodjo, women with children would do 
						that. I do not believe that the two rooms or three 
						rooms, which were allegedly put up by Mateko and Yodjo 
						were divided by the family and each given one room to 
						occupy. I believe that the evidence of P.W.3 is a 
						fabrication and I reject it as unworthy of 
						consideration. Again there is conflicting evidence as to 
						the number of rooms, which were initially put up. While 
						P.W.2 stated in his evidence that three rooms were 
						initially put up P.W.3. stated that only two rooms were 
						constructed&#8230;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The evidence is however 
						indisputable that the land was bought by Comfort Mateko 
						alone, Exhibit B, which is a receipt, indicates that the 
						late Mateko paid an amount of 9 pounds sterling as the 
						value of the land and it was paid to Tei Bigoe on 
						17/11/53. The name Yodjo was not indicated on the 
						receipt as joint purchaser. When the plaintiff&#8217;s 
						attention was drawn to this during cross-examination he 
						only said that that cannot be true and if a receipt like 
						that exists then Madam Mateko&#8217;s name was used in the 
						receipt because she was senior to Yodjo. Plaintiff also 
						said that Yodjo&#8217;s name was excluded from the receipt 
						because it was issued after her death. I am afraid the 
						above explanation cannot be accepted having regard to 
						the evidence on record. According to the plaintiff Yodjo 
						died in 1958. According to exhibit 3 the receipt was 
						issued on 17/11/53. if Yodjo died in 1953 then this 
						receipt was issued five years before she died. The 
						plaintiff&#8217;s evidence that the receipt covering the land 
						was issued after the death of Yodjo cannot be true. The 
						plaintiffs evidence that the land was acquired jointly 
						by Madam Mateko and Yodjo cannot therefore also be 
						true.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I am of the view 
						therefore that in evaluating the evidence adduced at the 
						trial the learned circuit judge did not look at the 
						personalities involved and their relationship with the 
						family of the plaintiff. As expected what engaged his 
						attention was the truthfulness of the witnesses or 
						otherwise in the light of circumstances of the family of 
						the late Comfort Mateko as well as the undisputed 
						documentary evidence respecting the sale of the land. 
						The conclusions of the learned circuit judge were not 
						actuated by bias and right in every respect and they 
						should not therefore be disturbed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We now move on to 
						ground (iii) of the grounds of appeal namely: &#8220;The 
						learned judge was wrong in admitting exhibit 3, which 
						was not pleaded and relying heavily on it.&#8221; In his 
						submissions apart from pointing out that exhibit 3 was 
						not pleaded learned counsel for the appellant did not 
						demonstrate how that affected the conclusions of the 
						court below. I would do well to reproduce the relevant 
						part of the written submissions of the appellant&#8217;s 
						counsel appearing at page 4 of his written submissions 
						as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Exhibit 3 purported to 
						be the document purporting to transferring the interest 
						of the one Teye Biyoe to one Mateko. Exhibit 3 appears 
						on page 124 of the record of proceedings. Exhibit 3 was 
						issued to Madam Mateko of Dorm, Nuaso. The person Mateko 
						who is the center of the dispute was Comfort Mateko of 
						Manya Kpongunor. There is no evidence that Comfort 
						Mateko ever lived at Dorm Nuaso. It is submitted that if 
						the trial judge had examined exhibit 3 critically he 
						would not have arrived at the conclusion that the name 
						on the document referred to Madam Comfort Mateko.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">With due deference to 
						learned counsel for the appellant his above submission 
						in respect of the content of exhibit 3 defies logic. In 
						the first place the document was supposed to have come 
						from the late Comfort Mateko herself. Even if we go by 
						the plaintiff&#8217;s version that the first defendant, taking 
						advantage of her mother&#8217;s illness and her custody of the 
						box containing the belongings of her late mother 
						discovered documents on the house, which she in 
						connivance with the second defendant sold to the third 
						defendant/respondent, we are still faced with the fact 
						that exhibit 3 came from the late Comfort Mateko 
						herself. Therefore the description of the late Comfort 
						Mateko on exhibit 3 does not in any affect the 
						document&#8217;s relevance to the third defendant&#8217;s 
						counterclaim, the basis of which is that he purchased 
						the house from the late Mateko and obtained exhibit 3 
						from her. On the description of Mateko as &#8220;from Dorm, 
						Nuaso&#8221; there is no evidence that the late Mateko never 
						lived in that area. Therefore it would not be reasonable 
						to come to the conclusion that the suggestion in exhibit 
						3 that she lived in a place other than Manya Kpongunor 
						meant that she was not the person described in the 
						document even though she had the document in her 
						possession.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The next ground of 
						appeal tackled by counsel for the appellant is 
						Additional Ground (a), i.e. &#8220;The learned judge was wrong 
						and biased in accepting exhibit 4, described as 
						conveyance, which was not registered and thumb printed 
						without a jurat.&#8221; The defendants led evidence as to why 
						the late Mateko decided to sell the house, the decision 
						to sell the house and the steps that were taken by the 
						late Comfort Mateko for the sale to be effected. The 
						substituted second defendant, Ruth Semaha testified as 
						D.W.2. She was a grand daughter of the late Comfort 
						Mateko and a daughter of the first defendant. According 
						to her evidence her grand mother was paralysed because 
						of stroke and she took care of her. Her grand mother 
						faced financial difficulties and when a tenant in her 
						Asesewa house, Alhaji Issah visited her at 
						Manyakpongunor she offered to sell the house to him. 
						Since Alhaji Issah was not in the position to buy the 
						house the late Mateko asked him to look for a buyer. Two 
						weeks later Alhaji came with the third defendant and 
						other men who were all Hausa people. Alhaji Issah 
						introduced the third defendant as the man who was 
						interested in the purchase of the house. The agreed 
						price of the house was ¢500,000.00. The late Mateko sent 
						the late Ofoe, the original second defendant, to 
						Agomanya to call in a letter writer, which he did. The 
						Letter writer was asked to prepare the document 
						evidencing the sale of the land by the late Mateko to 
						the third defendant. When the letter writer brought the 
						prepared document, he read the contents to the late 
						Mateko who collected it from the letter writer and gave 
						it to the late Ofoe to read. After that the late Mateko 
						thumb printed it and so did the third defendant. Four 
						other persons who accompanied the third defendant also 
						thumb printed the document. The first defendant thumb 
						printed it while the late Ofoe signed it. Finally a copy 
						of a photograph of the late Mateko was given to the 
						letter writer who pasted it on the document. The 
						document did not have a jurat on the face of it. The 
						evidence of Ruth Semaha found support with the 
						testimonies of Alhaji Issah and the third defendant who 
						were present at the sale. In the case of Kotokoli v. 
						Sarbali reported in [1981] G.L.R. 497 it is recorded in 
						the head notes as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The general rule of 
						evidence was that where an illiterate executed a 
						document, any other party to the document who relied 
						upon it should prove that it was read over and if 
						necessary interpreted to the illiterate. That was a rule 
						based mainly on common sense. Evidence should be 
						preserved of the fact that illiterate natives who were 
						parties to conveyances had the contents of such 
						conveyances clearly interpreted to them in their own 
						native language and that they fully appeared to 
						comprehend the nature and effect of the transactions 
						evidenced by the document. However where the document 
						does not bear a jurat on the face of it but the party 
						who executed it did not object either to it or the 
						transaction which it sought to evidence, the general 
						rule should not be allowed to defeat the document on the 
						mere technical ground of lack of a jurat. In the instant 
						case, the receipt which counsel sought to avoid was 
						issued by one illiterate to another and it bore no jurat 
						but it could be inferred from the evidence that the 
						appellant understood and fully appreciated its meaning 
						and effects and he was therefore bound by its contents.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Waya v. Byrouthy (1958)

						G.L.R. 90 and Youhana v. Abboud [1973] 1 G.L.R. 258 
						cited.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instant appeal 
						there is every indication on the face of the record that 
						the late Mateko fully appreciated the meaning and effect 
						of the document, which evidenced the sale transaction. 
						She gave all documents respecting her ownership of the 
						house to the third defendant/respondent after she had 
						received payment of the price of the house. The 
						respondent was allowed to go in to possession with 
						Alhaji Issah, the former tenant of the late Mateko 
						becoming his tenant. The late Mateko did not challenge 
						his ownership and possession of the house until her 
						death in 1993. It would therefore not be proper at this 
						stage to allow the absence of jurat on the document to 
						defeat the ends of justice.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Ground (b) of the 
						Additional Grounds of Appeal reads: The learned judge 
						showed bias when he declared in his judgment as follows: 
						&#8220;How much can a kenkey seller make in a town like 
						Asesewa to enable her feed herself and leave some money 
						to undertake a building project&#8221;. I think we would be in 
						a better position to appreciate the import of the above 
						quotation from the judgment of the circuit court if we 
						are made to see the context in which the statement was 
						made. I would therefore reproduce a relevant portion of 
						the judgment appearing at page 107 of the record of 
						appeal as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The plaintiff tried to 
						suggest to the court that his sister worked with Comfort 
						Mateko and there by in various ways contributed to the 
						continuation of the house. He said that Mercy Matey, 
						Dandjie assisted and sold kenkey and Adjo assisted 
						Mateko to sell cloth and that it was from these trading 
						activities that Mateko was able to extend the house to 
						seven rooms.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I do not believe that 
						the two sisters of the plaintiff made any contribution 
						toward the continuation of the house. How much can a 
						kenkey seller make in a town like Asesewa to enable her 
						feed herself and leave some money to undertake a 
						building project. I do not believe that they are capable 
						of making any financial contribution towards the 
						continuation of the house. If however they helped in any 
						way then it was because they were staying with Comfort 
						Mateko and were being fed by her and so they might have 
						carried sand or water while the construction was taking 
						place. They do not thereby [become] joint owners of the 
						house with Comfort Mateko&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Looking at the context 
						within which the statement complained of was made by the 
						learned circuit judge I do not think that that evidence 
						bias on his part. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I would like to take 
						the last two grounds of appeal argued by counsel for the 
						appellant together, namely ground (c) of the Additional 
						Grounds of Appeal and ground (i) of the original Grounds 
						of Appeal. Ground (c) of the Additional Grounds of 
						Appeal reads: &#8220;The learned trial judge was wrong in law 
						when he held that H/No. B 20, Asesewa which was sold to 
						the 3rd defendant was valid, in the face of the 
						overwhelming evidence on record that the rooms in the 
						house were shared to plaintiff and his three sisters and 
						the 1st defendant for which customary &#8216;aseda&#8217; was 
						provided.&#8221; Ground (i) of the original grounds of appeal 
						also reads: &#8220;The judgment is against the weight of 
						evidence.&#8221; I must say at this stage that Ground (i) of 
						the original grounds of appeal has been looked at in 
						some respect as we considered other grounds of appeal in 
						this judgment. All the same we can still look at some 
						other aspects of that ground. The conclusion of the 
						learned circuit judge is that the house in dispute is 
						not family property but the self acquired property of 
						the late Comfort Mateko. In his bid to establish that 
						the house in dispute was family property and not the 
						self acquired property of the late Mateko the plaintiff 
						led evidence to show that before the death of Mateko she 
						had allotted rooms in the house to the sisters of the 
						plaintiff and two uncompleted rooms to the plaintiff as 
						gift in respect of which they provided the customary &#8220;aseda&#8221;. 
						The gift of the rooms to the plaintiff and his siblings 
						was supposed to have been preceded by the help and 
						support the plaintiff and his sisters gave to the late 
						Mateko in building four more rooms in addition to the 
						existing ones. The circuit court did not accept the 
						evidence in that regard as reliable. It must not be 
						forgotten that the focus of that line of evidence was 
						aimed at establishing that the house in dispute is 
						family property. As demonstrated in the plaintiff&#8217;s 
						Statement Claim in the case against the third 
						defendant/respondent before the District Court, Grade 1, 
						Somanya, the plaintiff made admission of the fact that 
						the late Mateko was the original owner of the house in 
						dispute. The plaintiff alleged in that Statement of 
						Claim that he was authorised by the family to proceed 
						with the case. As demonstrated by the proceedings of the 
						Somanya District Court quoted above, when one Emmanuel 
						Narh Matey applied to be joined as co-defendant in that 
						case and his counsel actually moved the Motion for 
						Joinder the plaintiff interrupted the proceeding on the 
						pretext that the elders of the family would settle the 
						case. The case was struck out and the third defendant, 
						the defendant in that case was awarded costs. Since 
						there is no evidence in the record of appeal that the 
						plaintiff did anything to facilitate settlement in that 
						case I am inclined to come to the conclusion that his 
						intervention in the application was a ploy to avert the 
						determination of the applicant, Emmanuel Narh Matey to 
						bring the truth to light. After all if the plaintiff did 
						not accept the challenge that the applicant for joinder 
						was the head of family and that the plaintiff had no 
						backing of the family to take action against the 
						defendant in that case, who had purchased the self 
						acquired property of the late Mateko prior to her death, 
						he could at least have filed an affidavit in opposition. 
						In my view he calculatingly misled the district court to 
						strike out the case when he had no intention to take 
						steps to facilitate settlement in the case. No doubt he 
						took action before the Circuit Court sometime after 
						Emmanuel Narh Matey had died. I am of the view that the 
						circuit court came to the right conclusion that the 
						house in dispute was self-acquired property of the late 
						Comfort Mateko, which she sold to the third 
						defendant/appellant. For the reasons given in this 
						judgment the appeal is dismissed as being devoid merit.</span></p>
