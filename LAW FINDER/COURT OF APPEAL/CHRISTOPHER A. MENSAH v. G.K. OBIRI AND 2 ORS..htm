						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The judgment of the

						Baddoo J. A.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">My lords, the question 
						with which we are concerned in these proceedings in my 
						view turns upon the determination of a simple question 
						which may be posed thus: Was the Applicant/Respondent 
						entitled to be allotted the l0% shares contained in a 
						special resolution by the 3rd Defendant/Appellant 
						company dated 3rd August 1986? There is no doubt that 
						this question essentially was the main plank of the 
						controversy at the trial with the other reliefs 
						dependent upon its resolution in that it raised the 
						question whether the applicant (respondent herein) was a 
						member of the said company within the intendment of 
						Section 30 of the companies Code, Act 179?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At the trial, while the 
						applicant contended that he was, the respondent 
						contended to the contrary. At the end of the trial, the 
						learned trial judge in his delivery, the subject matter 
						of these proceedings, made a determination in favour of 
						the respondent herein that he was entitled to the title 
						in the said shares and further ordered that the 
						respondent issue him with a share certificate in respect 
						of the said shares.&nbsp; Following the said delivery, 
						appellant lodged on onslaught against the judgment by 
						filing a notice of appeal to this court on the following 
						grounds:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1)&nbsp; that the judgment 
						was against the affidavit evidence tendered by the 
						parties.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) The judge erred in 
						law by giving judgment for the applicant/respondent when 
						the whole case was based on estoppel contrary to the 
						well-established rule that no cause of action can be 
						founded on estoppel.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(3) The learned trial 
						judge wrongly shifted the burden of proof on the 
						respondent/appellant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I wish first of all to 
						refer to the submission urged on us by the appellants 
						through their counsel on the issue of estoppel; I think 
						that the said point actually missed the real nature of 
						the applicant's case. It would appear that the use of 
						the word estoppel was in relation to the denials of the 
						appellants of their own prior acts one which arises in 
						the realms of evidence, the effect of which is that a 
						party is precluded from denying the bounden effect of 
						his prior acts. I think that although much time and 
						effort was put in the submissions on the said point, it 
						is clear from a careful reading of the entire 
						proceedings that the action which originated before the 
						trial court by means of a notice of motion was not based 
						on estoppel but rather the unequivocal acts of the 
						company the effect of which if I understand the 
						respondent's case is that, the appellant cannot having 
						regard to the consequences which the law places on them 
						be enabled to reside therefrom. Accordingly, the point 
						based on the said estoppe is dismissed as a 
						misconception. I hope that in dismissing the said ground 
						in comparatively few words, I shall not be taken to be 
						disrespectful to the arguments submitted to us on the 
						same.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I now turn to the main 
						issue for determination in these proceedings and have 
						come to the view that the judgment of the trial judge, 
						the subject matter of this appeal was right in all the 
						circumstances of the case. As stated earlier on, the 
						main point which fell before the trial court to decided 
						was whether the respondent herein was entitled to the 
						shares allotted to him by the special resolution of the 
						company dated 3rd August 1986? In considering this 
						question in my opinion, it is important to consider the 
						subsequent steps taken on the said resolution. In 
						particular the following acts may be noted.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1) the filing of CAM1, 
						a copy of the special resolution registered under 
						section 176 of the companies code, </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) the filing of 
						Exhibit CAM2 under section 43 of the companies code by 
						which the alteration in the shareholding of the company 
						was notified to the Registrar of companies,</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(3) the filing of CAM 
						3, an alteration in the stated capital of the company 
						under section 66 of the companies code.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">These acts were all 
						statutory steps taken under the companies code and filed 
						before the Registrar companies on 3rd August 1987 the 
						regularity of which has not been raised either in this 
						court or the court below. In my thinking, by their 
						combined effect, the title of the respondent herein to 
						the shares allotted to him was completed and he was 
						therefore at the date when he made a demand on the 
						respondents to have the share certificate issued to him 
						right in so doing. As can be discerned from the 
						authorities on the issue of allotment and the same 
						subsequently entitling the allottee to the issue of the 
						shares, what is important is to look at the intention of 
						the parties from the surrounding circumstances of the 
						case. Indeed in the Ghanaian case of Conte v. Kpeglo 
						[1964] GLR 643 311 Ollennu JSC (as he then was) quoting 
						from SPITZEN v. CHINESE CORPORATION LTD. (1889) 80 LT 
						347 @ 351 had this to say at 315:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;In the first place, I 
						have to consider what meaning is to be attached to these 
						words (allotment and issue). First of all, what is on 
						allotment of shares? Brooding speaking, it is on 
						appropriation by the directors or the managing body of 
						the company of shares to a particular person. The legal 
						effect of the appropriation depends on the 
						circumstances.&nbsp; Thus it may be an offer of shares to the 
						allottee or it may be an acceptance of an application 
						for shares by the allottee, but of itself the allotment 
						does not necessarily create the status of membership. 
						The allotment may be, and probably generally [where it 
						is an offer] such as to give title in the shares the 
						moment the allottee communicates his acceptance of it to 
						the company whose directors make the allotment; but it 
						seems to me that the allotment may be subject to a 
						condition as for example, that the allottee should not 
						only indicate acceptance, but perform same other act, 
						such as payment of a sum of money. In other words, I 
						think that the company may offer specified shares to A.B 
						on the terms that the titles of A.B should not arise 
						until he has paid a sum of money to the company and this 
						being so a contract may provide, as I think that the 
						allotment shall be subject to conditions&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Again, in Halsbury's 
						Laws of England volume 7, 4th Ed. Para 368 @ 264, the 
						learned authors writing on this same point provide 
						substantially to the same effect as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The term issue of 
						shares is also used in connection with shares which are 
						signed for by the signatories to the memorandum are 
						issued when the company is registered. As regards other 
						shares, when a person who has agreed to take shares is 
						entered in the register as a shareholder, the shares 
						have been issued to him although he has not obtained the 
						share certificate. But a resolution to allot shares is 
						not necessarily the issue of them, and the term seems to 
						mean allotment followed by registration or possibly some 
						other act, distinct from allotment whereby the title of 
						the allottee becomes complete&quot; see Halsbury's&nbsp; 4th 
						Edition vol. 7(1) Reissue Para. 425 @ 279 (2) CLARK'S 
						case (1878) 8 Ch. D 365.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1) POOL'S case (1887) 
						35 Ch. D. 579.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have upon a careful 
						reading of the above statements come the view that they 
						apply equally to the Ghanaian situation particular in 
						view of section 30 of the Companies code, which describe 
						who a member of a company is. It is important in my 
						opinion for their purpose to refer in particular to 
						section 30 (2) which reads:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Every other person who 
						agrees with the company to become a member of the 
						company and whose name is entered in the register of 
						members shall be a member of the company&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I think that by the 
						acts evidenced in these proceedings as Exhibits CAM1, 
						CAM2 and CAM3, if the special resolution of 3/8/86 was 
						not ultra vires the company within the provisions of 
						section 22(b) of the companies code, then the allottee 
						by these subsequent steps taken on the said resolution, 
						has thereby become a member of the company. In 
						particular, I wish to say that by filing the particulars 
						of the said special resolution which had the effect of 
						amending the regulation of the company the allottee had 
						constituted thereby in his favour, a binding contract 
						between him and the company within the provision of 
						section 21 of the companies code, Act 179. To my mind, 
						the effect of the said act in particular in terms of its 
						consequence is one which the respondents cannot lightly 
						displace as they sought to do in the court below. I have 
						examined the record of proceedings as well as the points 
						which were taken by the appellants and I do not think 
						that they raise the question of the said special 
						resolution being ultra vires, therefore I am of the 
						thinking that the allottee namely the respondent&nbsp; herein 
						had his title to the said shares completed and or 
						perfected in his favour. I wish to say that whiles the 
						appellants herein do not deny that the shares were paid 
						for their concern is that they were not paid for by the 
						respondent. In my view, the said point is not one which 
						was credibly taken having regard to the fact that 
						section 36 of the code provides to the following effect: 
						&quot;the register of members shall be prima facie evidence 
						of any matters in this code directed or authorized to be 
						inserted therein&quot;. From the said provision, it is clear 
						that the entries contained in CAM2 and CAM3 in 
						particular that the shares have been paid for is 
						decisive of the company having received the 
						consideration for the allotment and I do not think that 
						the bare denial by one of the allottees in that they did 
						not pay for them operates to defect the legal 
						consequence of the said unequivocal acts done by the 
						company of which he is a director.&nbsp; I also venture to 
						say that the said unequivocal act, operate to defeat the 
						situation provided for in section 42(2) of the code 
						which specifically provides that where shares are issued 
						otherwise than wholly in cash, the company shall deliver 
						to the Registrar of Companies for registration a copy of 
						the said agreement duly stamped embodying the true value 
						of the consideration to be provided by the person in 
						whose favour the said shares have been issued.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Speaking for myself, I 
						think that the fact that in filing CA 1, the company did 
						not do this means as that it is indeed true that the 
						shares were paid for. It is important to ask whether the 
						company would have taken the steps evidenced by CAM1, 
						CAM2 and CAM3 if the condition attached to the allotment 
						was not met by the allottee? I do not think so; I think 
						on the contrary these acts provide evidence that the 
						conditions (if any) attached to the allotment have been 
						satisfied. I also do not think that the mere fact that 
						the returns were not filed within the period provided 
						affects it subsequent registration as was contended for 
						by counsel for the appellant at the trial below. I am of 
						the opinion that since the transaction relating to the 
						shares as can be discerned from CAM2 was expressed to be 
						in cash, the company was not obliged to comply with 
						section 42(2) in terms of the 28 days provided for the 
						registration of the agreement, it being applicable to 
						non-cash transactions in respect of shares. On the 
						contrary, in my opinion if anything having regard to the 
						fact that the stated capital of the company was 
						increased and or raised by the cumulative effect of the 
						said exhibits if there was a default in satisfying 
						section 66(2) of the code by not having the particulars 
						thereof registered within 28 days this by itself does 
						not defeat the shares so issued but the registrar of 
						Companies may apply, the sanction provided for in 
						section 66(3) for as long as the default continued.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my judgment 
						therefore the instant appeal fails and the judgment of 
						the learned trial judge is affirmed together with the 
						order declaring title to the said shares in the 
						respondent as well as the order that the respondents 
						issue a certificate to him in respect of the said 
						shares. I would however, having regard to the powers of 
						this Court by virtue of rules 32 of CI. 19 wish to vary 
						the order made upon the respondent by directing that the 
						certificate to, be issued by them be done within 30 days 
						from today I think that having regard to the 
						circumstances of this case it is desirable that the 
						respondent be given a time limit&nbsp; within which to comply 
						with the order relating to the issue of the share 
						certificate and it is so ordered.</span></p>
