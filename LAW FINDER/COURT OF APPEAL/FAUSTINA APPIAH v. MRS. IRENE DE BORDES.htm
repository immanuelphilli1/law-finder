						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">ARYEETEY, J.A.:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A brief background to 
						this appeal is as follows: The late Mr. Harold Smith 
						Boatin, the testator herein was married to Mrs. Rebecca 
						Boatin in 1939 and had children by her, one of whom is 
						the defendant/respondent. Due to the illness of his wife 
						the couple were separated. The late Harold Boatin who 
						was also known as Papa Boatin cohabited with the 
						plaintiff/appellant in House number 32, Kwadaso and had 
						two children by her. The appellant maintains that the 
						relationship between her and the late Harold Boatin was 
						that of husband and wife under customary marriage. 
						Before his death on 8th March 1988, the late Papa Boatin 
						approached a lawyer by name Mr. J. A. Darko to prepare a 
						will for him. After the testator had approved the draft 
						of the said will the lawyer caused it to be typed by his 
						secretary, Anna Ewusi-Amoako (PW4). He then asked his 
						secretary to take the completed will to the testator for 
						execution to be carried out. Upon direction from the 
						secretary the testator invited two witnesses who arrived 
						at his residence to play the role of attesting 
						witnesses. The will, exhibit A was duly executed. After 
						the death of the testator one of the executors named in 
						the will applied for probate of the said will only to be 
						confronted with a caveat from the respondent. The caveat 
						was based on the following grounds: (a) That the 
						signature on the said will was not that of the testator, 
						(b) That the late testator lacked the mental capacity to 
						have given instructions for the making of his Will 
						neither did he give instructions to the lawyer for the 
						making of the purported Will.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Consequently the 
						plaintiff as beneficiary under the will was called upon 
						to prove the will in solemn form. On 21st October, 1988 
						she filed a writ of summons before the Kumasi High Court 
						claiming the following reliefs: &#8220;(a) A Declaration that 
						the LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT of the late HAROLD SMITH 
						Boatin made on the 8th day of February, 1988 is valid. 
						(b) An order that the plaintiff is as against the 
						defendant, entitled to a grant of probate of the said 
						WILL of the said deceased person who died on the 8th of 
						March, 1988. (c) Any other and further orders as are in 
						the circumstances of this case, just in terms of Order 
						63 Rule 6. The issues that were spelt out for the 
						determination before the trial court as listed in the 
						summons for the directions were as follows: (1) Whether 
						or not the last Will and Testament of the late Harold 
						Smith Boatin dated the 8th of February, 1988, is valid 
						or was his act or deed. (2) Whether or not the late 
						testator had the testamentary capacity to make or 
						execute the said will. (3) Whether or not the plaintiff 
						is entitled to the reliefs claimed by her.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In her judgment the 
						learned trial judge looked at the evidence adduced on 
						both sides respecting the mental capacity of the 
						testator and concluded as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;In determining whether 
						a testator had the mental capacity to make a will, the 
						law required that there should be a sound disposing mind 
						both at the time when the instructions for the will were 
						given and when the will was executed. See the case of IN 
						RE COLE (Decd): CUDGOE VRS. COLE, [1977] 2 G.L.R.315. 
						According to PW5, the deceased gave him instructions on 
						6/2/88, a day after DW1 had seen him and said nothing 
						about his condition. On that same 5/2/88, the deceased 
						wrote exhibit CW1, a letter to the Regional Manager, 
						State Housing Corporation, telling him of the loss of 
						his lease in respect of H/No. E32, Kwadaso. In that 
						letter he asked for a duplicate copy of the lease to be 
						made available to him at his earliest convenience. He 
						notified him of a change in his former address.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have looked at the 
						letter and I am unable to accept the assertion that the 
						deceased person&#8217;s mental capacity was in any way 
						impaired at the time&#8230; In the case of BANKS vrs. 
						GOODFELLOW (1870) L.R.5 Q.B.549 at 564 referred to in In 
						Re Cole, Cockburn, C.J. in his illuminating judgment 
						laid down a test for determining mental capacity to make 
						a will. He said and I quote: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8216;It is essential to the 
						exercise of such a power that a testator shall 
						understand the nature of the act and the effects, shall 
						understand the nature of the property of which he is 
						disposing, shall be able to understand and appreciate 
						the claims to which he ought to give effect, and with a 
						view to the latter object, that no disorder of the mind 
						shall poison affections, perverse his sense of right, or 
						prevent the exercise of his natural faculties.&#8217; &#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Even though the learned 
						trial judge was of the view that the testator was of 
						sound mind at the time that he was supposed to have 
						executed the will, she came to the conclusion that the 
						signature on the will exhibit A did not come from him. 
						She was of the view that the signature on the will 
						differed materially from the known signatures appearing 
						on various documents. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In evaluating the 
						evidence of the expert witness the learned judge 
						reminded herself of the decision in the Court of Appeal 
						case of Sasu v. White Cross Insurance Co. Ltd. [1960] 
						G.L.R. 4, to the effect that expert evidence is to be 
						received with care. At page 83 of the record of appeal 
						the learned judge expressed her views in the following 
						words:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Counsel submitted that 
						in the light of the evidence led by the plaintiff in 
						proof of due execution of the will, the burden shifted 
						onto the defendant to prove the contrary. In this case 
						does it appear on the face of the WILL that it was 
						executed by the deceased? Looking at the signature on 
						the face of the WILL, there is something which is 
						conspicuous and which does not appear in any of the 
						known signatures of the deceased. There is a line 
						beneath the signature on the WILL.&nbsp; This line does not 
						appear on any of the documents with the admitted 
						signatures of the deceased. In a letter written by the 
						deceased to the Regional Manager of State Housing 
						Corporation dated 5/2/88, three days before the will was 
						allegedly executed, this line does not appear. CW1, the 
						handwriting expert to whom the signature on exhibit A 
						and other known signatures of the deceased were sent for 
						comparison, told the court in his report, exhibit CW6 
						that in his opinion the deceased did not sign exhibit A. 
						He had arrived at that conclusion because of the 
						dissimilarities, which he detected as indicated in 
						exhibit CW5. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Admittedly, such 
						evidence of an expert is to be received with reserve and 
						does not absolve or preclude a judge from forming his 
						own opinion on the evidence as a whole. The handwriting 
						expert was a court witness. He was not called by any of 
						the parties. He gave me no cause to believe that he came 
						to court to fight a cause or with a biased mind&#8230; I have 
						considered his opinion in the light of the totality of 
						the evidence and I am inclined to accept it as 
						representing the truth of the matter. I therefore find 
						as a fact that the signature on exhibit A is not that of 
						the deceased.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellant filed 
						three grounds of appeal as follows: (1) That the 
						judgment is against the weight of evidence adduced. (2) 
						That the learned trial judge erred in law when she 
						preferred the expert opinion of the court witnesses to 
						the evidence of PW1, PW3 and PW4 (the attesting 
						eyewitnesses) which was corroborated in the relevant 
						material issue of the signature of the testator, by the 
						evidence of DW3, the testator&#8217;s brother of the full 
						blood. (3) That the learned trial judge therefore erred 
						in law when she pronounced against the validity of the 
						said will. I intend to take all the three grounds 
						together since they are closely interrelated. It is the 
						submission of the appellant&#8217;s counsel in the main that 
						since the evidence of the witnesses, including the 
						attesting witnesses to the execution, who were present 
						at the time of the execution of the will, was not 
						effectively challenged the learned trial judge should 
						have at least given some explanation as to why she did 
						not take that into account in arriving at her conclusion 
						that what appears on exhibit A is not the signature of 
						the testator.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Having come to the 
						conclusion that the testator had the mental capacity to 
						make the will the remaining all important issue to 
						determine was whether or not the last Will and Testament 
						of the late Harold Smith Boatin dated the 8th of 
						February, 1988, was valid or was his act or deed. The 
						plaintiff called as her witnesses the two attesting 
						witnesses, Kwadwo Owusu Banahene (PW1) and Daniel 
						Quainoo (PW3) as well as Anna Ewusi-Amoako (PW4) who 
						typed the will upon the instructions of the lawyer whom 
						the testator engaged to make his will. What came out 
						clearly in their evidence is that all three of them were 
						present at the same time when the late Papa Boatin 
						signed the will followed by the two attesting witnesses 
						who signed. The first to sign after the testator was PW1 
						followed by PW3. When the three witnesses were 
						cross-examined they stood their ground.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At page 83 of his book, 
						Law of Wills in Ghana, Mr. Justice Azu Crabbe, explains 
						the effect of attestation as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Where the document 
						propounded as a will appears to be duly signed and 
						witnessed in accordance with the requirements of section 
						2 of the Wills Act, 1971 (Act 360) unless the contrary 
						is alleged the maxim omnia presumumtur rite esse acta 
						applies, unless the contrary is alleged, and thus 
						shifting the burden of proof on the person propounding 
						it&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is obvious that the 
						requirements of proper form and due execution are no 
						mere technicalities. They form part of the substantive 
						law and they are &#8220;the first line of defence against 
						fraud upon the dead&#8221;: see In the Estate of Fuld (No.3); 
						Hartley v. Fuld [1968] P.675 at p. 719. I quite agree 
						with counsel for the appellant that the learned trial 
						judge should have at least commented on the testimonies 
						of the attesting witnesses PW1 and PW3 as well as the 
						evidence of PW4. Even though the testimonies of the 
						three witnesses tended to show beyond doubt that the 
						will, exhibit A was duly executed, they were completely 
						ignored by the trial judge. When the plaintiff 
						successfully adduced evidence to show that exhibit A was 
						duly signed and executed the burden certainly shifted on 
						the defendant.&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Alhaji Bukari Yakubu, 
						CW1, testified as court witness. His evidence related to 
						the genuineness or otherwise of the testator&#8217;s 
						signature. The effect of his report is that the late 
						Papa Boatin did not sign exhibit A. The conclusion 
						reached by the expert witness was preferred to that of 
						the evidence coming from the three witnesses who were 
						supposed to be present when the will was executed. The 
						complaint of the appellant&#8217;s counsel is that the trial 
						court completely disregarded the evidence of 
						eyewitnesses to the execution of the will and relied on 
						alleged discrepancies in the known signatures of the 
						testator and the one appearing on exhibit A.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have taken sometime 
						to examine the enlarged versions of the four known 
						signatures appearing at page 105 of the record of appeal 
						and I notice a short line appearing underneath the 
						letter &#8216;S&#8217; contained in the disputed signature. That 
						line does not appear in any of the known signatures as 
						observed by the learned trial judge. I have also had a 
						good look at the four known signatures of Papa Boatin at 
						page 105 of the record of appeal. The &#8216;o&#8217; and &#8216;a&#8217; in 
						Boatin appearing in exhibits 1 and 2 stand separately. 
						On the other hand the &#8216;o&#8217; and &#8216;a&#8217; in Boatin appearing in 
						exhibits AB and BN are joined together by lines at their 
						tops. In case of exhibit AB the line is longer and 
						stretches from the initial &#8216;B&#8217; and passes over the top 
						of &#8216;o&#8217; and continues to &#8216;a&#8217;. That demonstrates that the 
						signatures in the &#8216;known&#8217; and undisputed column are not 
						identical. In my opinion, therefore, it is dangerous to 
						base any conclusion as to the authenticity of the 
						signature of the testator appearing in exhibit A on 
						supposed discrepancies or otherwise, which were not 
						adequately explained in the short testimony of the 
						expert witness, rather than the credible evidence of 
						witnesses who were supposed to be present at the time 
						the will was executed and two of whom duly attested to 
						the signature of the testator.&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The three witnesses 
						testified that they actually saw the late Boatin append 
						his signature to exhibit A followed by signatures of the 
						two attesting witnesses. Their testimony does not 
						encounter any effective challenge from the defendant. I 
						am therefore inclined to agree with counsel for the 
						appellant that the learned trial judge erred in ignoring 
						their evidence and relying solely on the alleged 
						discrepancies appearing in the signatures. I will 
						therefore allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of 
						the trial court. I give judgment in favour of the 
						appellant in respect of reliefs (a) and (b) of her 
						claim.</span></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;I agree with the very 
						well reasoned judgment of my brother and would only add 
						these few words. The principal relief sought by the 
						appellant, was for a declaration that the disputed will 
						of 8th February 1998 was valid. At the court below, the 
						respondents raised several objections to the validity of 
						the alleged will, one of them being that those whose 
						names appear on the purported will as attesting 
						witnesses did not subscribe it at the request of, and in 
						the presence of the deceased nor did the deceased sign 
						in their presence. The gentlemen themselves gave 
						evidence to the contrary and indeed there is no evidence 
						on the record to discredit them. The trial judge herself 
						took the position, and rightly so in my view, that their 
						prima facie evidence was unassailable, hence her 
						conclusion that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220; The plaintiff who is 
						seeking to rely on the will led evidence to establish 
						its due execution&#8221;.&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The respondents 
						evidence that they did not subscribe to the will at his 
						request was intended to be inferred from their main 
						contention that the signature is a complete forgery I 
						shall therefore determine that issue shortly. If the 
						answer to that question turns out to be in the positive, 
						then of course their claim will naturally fall flat on 
						its face.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The next complaint is 
						that the deceased was so sick as to be unable to give 
						instructions for a will and execute same. On this issue, 
						the trial judge made no finding one way or the other, 
						although she did review the evidence on both sides of 
						this legal divide. We are therefore at this rehearing 
						under a duty to determine that question on the basis of 
						the available evidence. The law is that, where the 
						sanity of a testator is impeached, the burden of proving 
						the necessary testamentary capacity, lies on the 
						propounder of the will. It must be proved clearly that 
						the testators mind was sufficiently clear when he made 
						his will or when he gave instructions for its 
						preparation, vide In re: Sackity Decd 1982-82 GLR 12. On 
						this issue, again, the appellant relied not only on her 
						evidence, but that of the Pw1, Pw2, Pw3, Pw4 and Pw5, 
						who prepared the will. The learned trial judge appears 
						to have placed very little value on the evidence in 
						particular of the Pw5, for the reason that all he could 
						tell the court was that the deceased was in good 
						condition at the time he gave the instruction. Of course 
						she was expecting him to speak pointedly about his 
						mental condition. I however think that her judgment on 
						the Pw5 was rather harsh and not in the least supported 
						by the record. My reasons are that he did more than 
						speak about his physical health or condition. He 
						unmistakably testified about his state of mind both at 
						the time he gave instructions and when he read through 
						the draft and approved of it. I reproduce a portion of 
						his testimony. &#8220;I prepared the will on the instructions 
						of the late Boatin and at the time he was of sound 
						disposing mind. He could remember events which took 
						place in 1987 and told me about them when I took the 
						draft to him for him to read through.&#8221;&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Earlier on in his 
						evidence, he had given a detailed description of the 
						process they i.e. the testator and himself, went through 
						in the preparation of the draft will. According to him, 
						he even walked him to a distance to pick a taxi back 
						home. The next day saw him at the testator&#8217;s house with 
						the draft which he read through and approved of. Two 
						days before these events the testator had written the 
						clearly unimpeachable Exhibit Cw1. The respondent had 
						alleged in her pleadings that, a serious illness on the 
						27th December has affected him so mentally and 
						physically as to deprive him of his testamentary 
						capacity. I however find no evidence in proof of these 
						material allegations. On the contrary, when questioned 
						about her condition as around the 30th of December, her 
						answers negate any suggestion that he was mentally and 
						physically unwell. I reproduce her answer.&nbsp; </span></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Why must we reject 
						these piece of cogent evidence in preference to the 
						Dw1&#8217;s testimony which the court found to be baseless, in 
						view particularly of the Exh. Cw1 and the fact that he 
						did not see him either on the 8th of February, and did 
						not also indicate from his report that he was unwell 
						when he was with him on the 5th?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Additionally, the sum 
						total of the respondents main objections to the claim as 
						are contained in the paragraphs 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 
						of the amended statement of defence filed on the 26th 
						November, 1992 is that the will is a forgery. I would 
						like to produce the relevant portions of the paragraphs 
						8, 10 and 11.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">8&nbsp; &#8220;The defendant says 
						that through the concubinage the deceased impressed upon 
						the plaintiff that the Patasi property plot no 32, 
						Kwadaso Estate, Kumasi would be a gift to his children 
						by his wife Mrs. Rebecca Boatin who together with one of 
						the children had paid so much of the price thereof.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">10&nbsp; The defendant says 
						further that the purported will </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Failed to benefit 
						persons such as one of the deceased&#8217;s daughters,

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">11.&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8220;The defendant 
						contends that by reason of the alleged matters above he 
						did not know and approve of the contents of the 
						purported will, did not have testamentary capacity at 
						the material time, did not give instructions for the 
						preparation of the purported will, the contents of which 
						were known to the plaintiff even before the said will 
						was read.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">12. The defendant says 
						the purported will does not bear the true signature of 
						the deceased; and it was not signed by him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">True the respondents 
						did not expressly allege nor charge the appellant with 
						forgery, and understandably therefore no particulars are 
						pleaded thereof in support of that. But quite plainly 
						the substance of the matters articulated very clearly in 
						the defence, particularly paragraph 12, is to accuse the 
						appellant with criminal conduct of the gravest kind in 
						the preparation of and or the making of the said will. 
						She therefore stands out either as the real perpetrator 
						or as an aidder and abettor.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Under our evidence 
						Decree 1975, NRCD 323, one cannot in a civil or for that 
						matter a criminal action, allege the commission of a 
						crime directly in issue by his opponent and succeed by 
						offering in proof of the matter alleged, the lower 
						burden of proof that obtains in civil cases i.e. proof 
						on the balance of probabilities. The degree of proof 
						required in such cases is proof beyond reasonable doubt, 
						the collorary being that, if the crime alleged is not 
						directly in issue one could safely get away with the 
						lighter burden of proof. The self explanatory rule 
						stipulates:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">13. &#8220;(1) In any civil 
						or criminal action the burden of persuasion as to the 
						commission by a party of a crime which is directly in 
						issue requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">With the main complaint 
						of the appellant being that the judgment is against the 
						weight of evidence, the two critical questions that 
						arise for our consideration are, whether the respondent 
						discharged the burden that fell on him by virtue of the 
						above provision. The critical question then would be 
						this? Would any reasonable tribunal exercising criminal 
						jurisdiction, if called upon to, find the appellant 
						guilty of the crime alleged?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Pure suspicions no 
						matter how numerous cannot in law amount to guilt. The 
						respondent accusers evidence in proof of the allegations 
						was made up of only her own evidence that she knows her 
						fathers signature so well that, that which appears on 
						the will is not his and the opinion evidence of the 
						expert. As opposed to that, we also have for the accused 
						appellant, who had to raise a reasonable doubt only in 
						her defence, we have the evidence of the lawyer who 
						prepared the said will, his clerk, the attesting 
						witnesses as well as the deceased testators own brother. 
						None of the persons who took part in the preparation and 
						execution of the will were discredited under cross 
						examination, thus making it difficult to understand the 
						basis of the trial judges finding that the presence of 
						the straight line under the disputed document is 
						overwhelming proof of the forgery. The weight of 
						evidence adduced at the trial points more to the fact 
						that he signed it than the contrary. Nonetheless, even 
						if we took the position the trial judge did, namely that 
						the burden shifted onto the defendant to prove that he 
						signed the will, the understanding being that the burden 
						on the respondent was the lighter burden that exits in 
						criminal cases, the fact still remains that the 
						appellants evidence was weightier than the respondents 
						and one cannot in all good conscience prefer their 
						evidence to the appellant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Finally, by the par 7 
						of the defence, the respondent alleges that the 
						relationship between the deceased testator and the 
						appellant was such that he could not possibly have given 
						all his properties to her children use to the exclusion 
						of his other ten children by four other women. Though 
						respondent catalogued in great detail the conduct of the 
						appellant, (it included continuous neglect, failure to 
						take care of him and provide food and etc) describing 
						their marriage as an unhappy one, she led not a shred of 
						evidence in support of them some of which were in any 
						case was denied by the appellant. The respondent never 
						elicited any such information about the marriage from a 
						person who is bound to know if such was their marriage. 
						No marriage is a perfect one. All marriages have faults. 
						But I am unable to hold on the facts of this case that 
						there are circumstances which are bound to excite the 
						suspicion of this court. In which case the appellant has 
						no duty to erase any for none is demonstrated here.</span></p>
