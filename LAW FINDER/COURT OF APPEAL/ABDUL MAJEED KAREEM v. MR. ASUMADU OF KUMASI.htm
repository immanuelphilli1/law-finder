						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						This is an appeal against the judgment of Kumasi Circuit 
						Court dated 4th August, 1997 which went against the 
						Defendant Appellant. The Plaintiff/Respondent's claim in 
						the Court below was for</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						(a) A declaration that the said Abdul Kareem Kwabena 
						Kareem is the owner lessee of all that piece or parcel 
						of land more particularly described as Kumasi-Boadi, 
						Plot 6, Block &#8220;A&#8221;.</span></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						The Defendant/Appellant also counter-claimed as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						(a) A declaration that the Defendant is entitled to Plot 
						6, Block &#8220;A&#8221;, Kumasi-Boadi.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						(b) Order of Injunction to restrain the Plaintiff by

						interfering with the Defendant's occupation and use of 
						Plot No. 6, Block &#8220;A&#8221;, Kumasi- Boadi or continuing any 
						acts of trespass.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						(c) Damages for trespass.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						The facts which were not disputed before the trial Court 
						were as follows: On 24th September, 1984 Nana Huahi 
						Tutuwaa II succeeded her grandmother as Obaapanin of 
						Boadi near Kumasi. Her predecessor Obaapanin Akosua 
						Addae had abdicated on account of her old age. After her 
						enstoolment, Nana Huahi Tutuwaa II (PW1) was shown the 
						stool&#8217;s properties. It came to her notice that one of 
						the stool&#8217;s properties, Plot No.6, Block A. Boadi had a 
						building structure on it. Upon enquiry, it was revealed 
						that the structure on the land had been put up by the 
						Defendant/Appellant. PW1 therefore caused her solicitors 
						to write to the Defendant inviting him to see PW1. The 
						relevant portion of the letter dated 16th June, 1986 
						reads as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						&#8220;Our client informs us that you are in occupation of her 
						land Plot No. 6, Block A, Boadi and you have developed 
						the land without her consent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">By 
						this letter, we wish to indicate to you that our client 
						has instructed us to write that you are given a week 
						from the date on receipt of this letter either to see 
						our client or otherwise in absence of that, we shall 
						issue writ of summons against you at High Court for 
						declaration of title against you&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						That letter is marked Exhibit 2. The Defendant/Appellant 
						explained that he was put in possession of the land 
						after he had approached elders of the stool for land and 
						after accredited representatives of the Queenmother 
						Obaapanin Akosua Addae and Odikro Opanin Kwadwo Dabo of 
						Boadi had shown him the land and collected ¢6,000 from 
						him as customary drinks. He obtained a receipt, Exhibit 
						One from the elders which reads:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						&#8220;I, C. K. Amoako, head of family, have received an 
						amount of ¢6,000 as Customary drinks on a piece of land 
						at Boadi allocated to Mr. Patrick Asumadu, of State 
						Fishing Corporation on this day 15th day of February, 
						1981 on behalf of Queenmother Obaapanin Akosua Addae and 
						Odikro Opanin Kwadwo Dabo of Boadi. Allocation paper 
						would be issued after new site plan has been approved by 
						the Town Planning Department, Kumasi&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						Exhibit One was signed by C. K. Amoako, who described 
						himself as head of family and Malam Issah Donkor who 
						became the Akwamuhene of Boadi and known as Nana Issah 
						Tabi (DW2).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						Eventually, the Defendant/Appellant and PW1 met at the 
						Chambers of the Solicitors of PW1 where PW1 asked the 
						Defendant to pay her ¢140,000 if he were to retain the 
						land. Even though that money was not paid to PW1, the 
						threat in Exhibit 2 to issue a writ against the 
						Defendant/Appellant was not pursued by PW1. However, 
						when he realised that his occupation of the land was 
						being threatened, the Defendant/appellant made a 
						complaint to the Asantehene&#8217;s liaison officer who could 
						not resolve the matter.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						The totality of the grounds of appeal are as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">1. 
						That the judgment of the Circuit Court, Kumasi was 
						against the weight of the evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">2. 
						The learned trial Circuit Judge erred in holding that 
						the receipt of ¢6,000 dated 15/2/81 given to the 
						Defendant being the purchase consideration for Plot 6, 
						Block A, Kumasi Boadi was not from the authorised 
						representatives and delegates of Huahi Stool of Boadi or 
						from the occupant of that stool, the customary grant to 
						the appellant was null and void when there was evidence 
						that the signatories of the receipt and along with 
						others, were authorised to grant stool lands to 
						prospective grantees for valuable consideration and 
						thereby pass title to them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">3. 
						The Court erred in coming to the conclusion that the 
						Defendant who acquired his title to Plot 6, Block A, 
						Kumasi Boadi after payment of customary grant 
						consideration of ¢6,000 in 1981 could be divested of 
						title subsequently because he failed or refused to pay a 
						subsequent demand of ¢140,000 from the new stool 
						authority Huahi stool of Boadi for the same plot when 
						the Defendant was in possession and had developed the 
						land.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">4. 
						To hold that the appellants counter-claim should fail is 
						not supported by the evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">5. 
						The learned trial Circuit Judge failed or refused to 
						consider the case of the appellant diligently and 
						adequately, thereby jumping to conclusions not supported 
						by the evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">By 
						far, the most important ground of appeal is additional 
						ground (1) which I have listed as ground (2) after 
						putting the original grounds and additional ground 
						together. In my humble opinion on that ground hinges 
						substantially all the other grounds. According to that 
						ground:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						&#8220;The learned trial Circuit Judge erred in holding that 
						the receipt of ¢6,000.00 dated 15/2/81 given to the 
						Defendant being the purchase consideration for Plot 6, 
						Block A, Kumasi Boadi was not from the authorised 
						representatives and delegates of Huahi stool of Boadi or 
						from occupant of that stool, the customary grant to the 
						appellant was null and void when there was evidence that 
						the signatories of the receipt and along with the owners 
						were authorised to grant stool lands to prospective 
						grantees for valuable consideration and thereby pass 
						title to them&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						The all important question to ask is whether at the time 
						of the lease to the Plaintiff as evidenced by the lease 
						agreement, Exhibit C there had been an effective 
						customary grant of the land to the appellant. I quite 
						agree with the conclusion reached by the learned trial 
						Circuit Judge that the identity of the land was not in 
						dispute. It was the same Plot 6, Block A, Boadi which 
						was occupied by the appellant that was leased by PW1 to 
						the respondent. The learned Circuit Judge adverted his 
						attention to the issue as to whether there was effective 
						customary grant to the appellant prior to the lease to 
						the respondent. He made the following observation in his 
						judgment at page 114 of the record of proceedings.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						&#8220;The Plaintiff&#8217;s allocation is documented. He had his 
						allocation in 1992 from the Huahi stool and its occupant 
						and elders who are accredited custodians of the land&#8230;The 
						Defendant on the other hand pleaded Plot No. 6, Block A, 
						Kumasi Boadi was the subject matter of a customary grant 
						from Boadi stool to the Defendant for a consideration of 
						¢6,000 on the 15/2/96.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						The customary grant was evidenced in writing &#8230; I have 
						reminded myself of the fact that merely having documents 
						on the land does not entitle a person to judgment for a 
						declaration of title to land. As was stated by Justice 
						Adade in the case of Hammond v. Odoi [1982-83] GLR p. 
						1215, esp. pg. 1303-4 where after citing the case of 
						Aryee v. Adofoley (1951) 3 WACA 161, 162 he concluded 
						&#8220;where prior oral customary grant can be established, no 
						amount of subsequent conveyance registered or not can 
						defeat the customary title&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In 
						this case, DW2 testified in support of the 
						Defendant/appellant's case that it was the accredited 
						representatives of the stool who granted the land to 
						appellant. Even though C. K. Amoako was not called as a 
						witness by the Defendant there is evidence that when the 
						Defendant made a report to the liaison officer of the 
						Kumasi Traditional Council, C. K. Amoako was called as a 
						witness. From the evidence of DW2 and the appellant, 
						Amoako&#8217;s evidence and that of DW2, were carefully 
						excluded from the report of enquiries made by PW2. 
						Indeed, the head of family, C. K Amoako and DW2 had the 
						occasion to explain their positions on the matter when 
						they met with the liaison officer of Kumasi Traditional 
						Council, Gabriel Bretuo Kyei-Agyen (PW2). From the look 
						of things, the report of the meeting Exhibit G as shown 
						by the cross-examination of PW2 was not a true 
						reflection of what took place at the proceeding at which 
						both DW2 and C. K. Amoako were present. For example C. 
						K. Amoako was not listed in Exhibit G as being present. 
						Even though the appellant and DW2 testified that there 
						were two meetings with PW2, the first one at which C. K. 
						Amoako was present and at which it was established that 
						the grant to the appellant was proper, PW2 was positive 
						that there was only one meeting at which Amoako was 
						present on 4th August, 1992. As it turned out Exhibit G 
						which is dated 4th August, 1992 does not list C. K. 
						Amoako as being present. The cross-examination of PW2 at 
						page 56 of the record clarifies the position.</span></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						From the answers given by PW2 in cross-examination 
						quoted above, he insists that C. K. Amoako was present 
						at the meeting of 4th August, 1992 as recorded by the 
						report, Exhibit G. When his attention was drawn to the 
						fact that Exhibit G is silent on what C. K. Amoako said 
						at that meeting, his response was that that was because 
						C. K. Amoako did not say anything at the meeting. He 
						added that he &#8220;did not bother to find out from C. K. 
						Amoako and Issah Donkor whether they had given the 
						receipt out&#8221;. However, the report of the meeting of 4th 
						August, 1992, Exhibit G, which PW2 insists was the only 
						meeting, he had with the Defendant/Appellant and PW1 
						does not list C. K. Amoako as being present. In fact, 
						PW2 at Page 50 line 29 of the proceedings testified in 
						his examination-in-chief that C. K. Amoako was not 
						present at the meeting at his office in response to his 
						invitation letter, Exhibit F.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						The evidence of the appellant and DW2 was that at an 
						earlier meeting with PW2, C. K. Amoako and DW2 owned up 
						as accredited agents of the stool who collected the 
						¢6,000 from the appellant. PW1 was therefore, advised to 
						have the matter settled since her own head of family had 
						admitted collecting ¢6,000 from the appellant for the 
						land. After that PW2 there and then, asked PW1 how much 
						drinks she would accept from the appellant for the 
						matter to be settled. She asked for a week. The head of 
						family, C. K. Amoako was not present at the second 
						meeting which Exhibit G represents and which comes to a 
						conclusion different from the earlier conclusion at the 
						meeting at which C. K. Amoako was present. As seen from 
						the cross-examination of PW2, he alleged that C. K. 
						Amoako was present at the meeting of 4th August, 1992 
						even though Exhibit G does not list him as being 
						present. As pointed out earlier, PW2 had stated in his 
						examination-in-chief that C. K. Amoako was not present 
						at that meeting. In any case, if PW2 recollects that C. 
						K. Amoako was at a meeting relating to the land in 
						dispute which is obviously not the meeting on 4th 
						August, 1992. That would lend support to the testimony 
						of the appellant that there was an earlier meeting with 
						C. K. Amoako and Mallam Donkor, DW2 who also testified 
						in support of the appellants case. According to the 
						evidence on record coming from the Defendant/Appellant 
						and DW2, that meeting enabled the appellant to establish 
						his case that he had a valid customary grant of the land 
						from accredited representatives of the stool. However, 
						according to the liaison officer, PW2 there was no such 
						meeting even though he admits at least that there was a 
						meeting at which C. K. Amoako was present. Still on the 
						issue as to whether there was effective customary grant 
						of the land in dispute to the appellant before the 
						enstoolment of PW2, the evidence on record is that the 
						appellant was in effective occupation of the land and I 
						do not think that the nature of the structures of the 
						land as depicted by the photographs which were tendered 
						in evidence would escape the notice of the important 
						members of the stool family who would have a say in 
						disposal of the land to outsiders. As it turned out, the 
						presence of a stranger was not challenged until PW1 was 
						enstooled to replace her grandmother who had abdicated. 
						In the case of Ankrah v. Ofori and others, [1974] 1 GLR 
						185, it was held that the first and most essential 
						requirement of an alienation of land by customary law 
						was publicity. In that case, it was held that the act of 
						taking possession constituted sufficient publicity to 
						the Plaintiff who owned a house nearby and to the whole 
						world that the land had been sold to the Defendants. In 
						the instant case, there was sufficient publication when 
						the appellant built structures on the land and operated 
						his poultry business there. If there was anything 
						improper about the grant of land to the Defendant in 
						1981, objection would have been raised from the 
						appropriate quarters since by his activities on the land 
						there was sufficient notice of the presence of the 
						appellant on the land which constituted publication of 
						the customary grant of the land in dispute to the 
						appellant. As it turned out, no objection was raised by 
						any of the members of the stool family until a new 
						queenmother, PW1 was enstooled. In the case of Ankrah v. 
						Ofori (supra), the Court of Appeal held that a 
						conveyance of land made in accordance with customary law 
						was effective as from the date it was made, a deed 
						subsequently executed by the grantor for the grantee 
						could add to but could not take from, the effect of the 
						grant, and where there was an omission to execute the 
						deed of conveyance, that omission could not affect the 
						grantees title. For the reasons given in this judgment, 
						the appellant succeeds in respect of additional ground 
						one. He also succeeds in the original ground of appeal 
						as well as, additional ground two, three and four. The 
						appeal is allowed. I would therefore, set aside the 
						judgment of the Court below and give the appellant 
						judgment in respect of his counter-claim. He is awarded 
						¢100,000 nominal damages for trespass.</span></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						BROBBEY, J.A.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I 
						am of the view that the appeal succeeds and should be 
						allowed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						The facts have been detailed out in the judgment of my 
						brother Aryeetey J.A and so I do not need to re-state 
						them. There is also no dispute that at the time the land 
						was leased to the respondent, the appellant had been in 
						occupation since 1981. I do not need to dilate on this 
						either. In sum, my reasons for allowing the appeal are 
						the following.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						(1) The basic question in the appeal was whether the 
						appellant&#8217;s grant was legal and valid. I hold the view 
						that the grant was valid because there was no occupant 
						of the stool at the time of the grant and PW1 as well as 
						the parties and the other witnesses agreed that the 
						Odikro and Queen parties and the other witnesses agreed 
						that the Odikro and Queenmother were those authorised to 
						grant those lands. The evidence of the appellant was 
						that when he desired to obtain land he was made to 
						appear before the Odikro, by name Opanin Dabo, the 
						queenmother, Akosua Addai, C.K. Amoako Head of family, 
						Mallam Issah who later became Akwamuhene and other 
						elders. His request was considered. He was asked to pay 
						¢6000. He paid it there and then. Later C.K. Amoako 
						issued a receipt for the payment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						This scenario leads me to conclude that the money was 
						paid for the land and it was meant for those who named 
						the price. It was also meant for those who were leasing 
						the land, who in actual fact were the Odikro, Obaapanin 
						and the elders present when the money was received.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						(2) Secondly, the grant was a customary one and I 
						consider it as such. Being a customary grant, it would 
						have been valid even if there were no receipt, provided 
						there was some evidence that money was demanded and 
						money was paid. The significance of the receipt, exhibit 
						one lies in the fact that it evidences the fact of the 
						payment of ¢6000 for the land following the naming of a 
						price by the landlord. Even if the receipt did not 
						expressly mention that the money was given to the Odikro 
						or Obaapanin or the elders, it stated categorically that 
						it was received on behalf of the landlords. I can place 
						no other interpretation to what happened than that the 
						money was meant for the land and was received for the 
						land. Finally they, eventual recipients, were to be the 
						very people who named the price to be paid, namely the 
						Odikro, Obaapanin and the elders.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						(3) To my mind, the appellant&#8217;s testimony that he 
						obtained the land from C.K. Amoako and Mallam Issah was 
						correct but that has to be understood to mean that it 
						was those two who actually demarcated the land to him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In 
						his evidence, he said C.K. Amoako and Issah were 
						mandated to show him the land. Since they did that 
						following the demand by the landlord for and payment of 
						¢6000, they showed the land to him on behalf of those 
						landlords.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">4. 
						It can safely be stated that judicial notice may be 
						taken of the fact that at customary law, the Odikro and 
						the queenmother do not handle cash in public. If moneys 
						had to be received, it is received on their behalf.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In 
						the instant case it was done by no less person than C.K. 
						Amoako whom none of the parties disputed to be the head 
						of the family.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">5. 
						The hard facts are that if the new queenmother claimed 
						that she could grant land, there was no reason why the 
						person whom she succeeded could not grant land.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">6. 
						By the time she became the queenmother, the disputed 
						land had been granted to the appellant by her 
						predecessor. Therefore, there was no other land 
						available to her to grant. This is the principle well 
						settled by the Supreme Court in REPUBLIC VS. LANDS 
						COMMISSION: EX PARTE VANDERPUYE ORGLE STATEDS 1999.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">7. 
						What makes her case even worse is that she agreed to 
						extract more money from the person she saw working on 
						the land by authority of her predecessor. If she had 
						been given the ¢140,000 she would have left the 
						appellant alone. That clearly demonstrated that she was 
						more interested in making money of the land. But she 
						acted at the wrong time because by the time she became 
						queenmother, there was no land for her to grant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						For these and the reasons stated in the judgment of my 
						brother Aryeetey, J.A. I would allow the appeal, set 
						aside the judgment of the trial court and reverse its 
						outcome.</span></p>

						Unfortunately, I do not agree with my learned brothers 
						that the appeal be allowed and the judgment of the lower 
						court reversed. I think the learned trial judges 
						findings and conclusion were borne out by the record. 
						The inferences are justified and I do not think we ought 
						to disturb them. At the trial, both parties sought for a 
						declaration of title to land, perpetual injunction and 
						damages for trespass, with the plaintiff respondent 
						additionally putting in a claim for recovery of 
						possession. To my mind, the state of the pleadings 
						clearly placed on the respondent first, the burden of 
						establishing title to the land in question. The 
						respondents claim had been that he obtained a valid 
						lease of the disputed land Plot No. 6 Block A Kumasi 
						Boadi from the owners the Huahi Stool through the person 
						authorised to grant lands, Obaapanin Huali Tutuwaa II. 
						The response of the defendant/appellant who the 
						undisputed facts show was in possession of the said land 
						prior to the grant, to these allegations is two folds. 
						First, he denied the respondents claim that he had 
						obtained a valid lease of the said land, and second, and 
						even more importantly he maintains that even if there 
						were any such grant, it was of&nbsp; no legal effect since as 
						far back as February, 1981, he had obtained a valid 
						customary grant of the said land from the owners acting 
						through their accredited agents C.K. Amoako and one 
						Mallam Issah. These gentlemen he had pleaded, had acted 
						for and on behalf of the Queen mother Obaapanin Akosua 
						Addai, and Odikro Kwadwo Addai, the persons authorised 
						to dispose of Huahi stool lands of Dabo. Before 
						proceeding to counter-claim, he also although in my view 
						the facts as pleaded by him do not disclose an action in 
						fraud or deceit, claimed that the lease was procured 
						through fraud and was therefore a complete nullity. 
						Inspite of these reservations I have expressed, he ought 
						at least to be commended for acting in accordance with 
						the rules. In compliance with the rules governing 
						pleadings, he particularised the fraud. These 
						particulars are useful for they give further and better 
						particulars of how he acquired the land. It is trite law 
						that he is bound by the pleadings and that is what he 
						has therefore to prove. I reproduce them</span></p>

						The co-defendant maintaining among other things that he 
						was the chief and owner of the land and further that

						Abban JA (as he then was) spelt out the plaintiff's duty 
						under the circumstances as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						&#8220;The plaintiff having sought a declaration of title to 
						the land in dispute, could only succeed upon the 
						strength of his case and not on the weakness of the 
						co-defendants case. It is true that the co-defendant 
						also counter-claimed for a declaration of title but that 
						is beside the point. For the co-defendants counter-claim 
						could not in any way lighten the weight of the burden on 
						the plaintiff to establish his title to the land by 
						preponderance of admissible evidence. The defense having 
						denied the plaintiffs title and then counter- claimed 
						for title, a burden was placed on the plaintiff to prove 
						his title satisfactorily or else he must fail: see Nkyi 
						vrs: Kumah 1959 GLR 281 CA and Nelson vrs: Amoah 1940 6 
						WACA 134.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						Should respondent have failed to prove his title, his 
						claim would have been dismissed leaving the plaintiff in 
						possession. Again, another authority for proposition is 
						Asare and others vrs: Appau II 1984-1986 1 GLR 599. The 
						position of the law was detailed as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						&#8220;The common run of land suits in our Courts has as the 
						plaintiff a person who claims title to land. Such a 
						defendant need not and usually does not seek any relief 
						in the proceedings being content with things as they are 
						Kodilinye vrs: Odu (supra) says that in that event the 
						plaintiff must rely on the weakness of his opponents 
						i.e. lack of title in the defendant. So that if the 
						plaintiff fails to prove that he is entitled to have a 
						declaration made of his title to the land, the action 
						ought to be dismissed, leaving the defendant in 
						possession of the land&#8221;. Per Amua-Sekyi JA (as he then 
						was) page 63. By way of emphasis, may I repeat that the 
						mere facts that appellant had counter-claim would not 
						change the position of the law. Undoubtedly the 
						respondent succeeded in establishing a prima facie title 
						to the land in question. He demonstrated, as he had 
						pleaded that</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						(a) he validly acquired a leasehold interest in the said 
						land from Obaapanin Huahi Tutuwaa II of Boadi, the 
						person authorised to alienate Huali stool lands.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						(b) He went into immediate possession and mailed cement 
						blocks on the said land.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						The plain truth is that none of these important matters 
						deposed to by respondent were challenged by the 
						appellant in any manner. It comes as no surprise. 
						Although in his defense, he had denied the existence of 
						any such lease and so as it were put him to strict 
						proof, his main challenge to his opponents claim is that 
						he had, prior to this grant acquired a valid freehold 
						customary interest in the subject matter. As regard the 
						respondents grantor the PW1 Nana Huahi Tutuwaa II she 
						was emphatic both in her evidence in chief and cross 
						examination that neither Amoako nor Mallam Issah Donkor, 
						the appellant&#8217;s alleged grantors have been given 
						authority to grant lands belonging to the stool. Having 
						established a prima facie case to title, the evidential 
						burden shifted on to the appellant to prove a better or 
						superior title.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In 
						real terms what was required of him was simply to rebut 
						the prima facie led by the respondent by establishing on 
						a preponderance of probabilities that he had prior to 
						the respondents acquisition acquired a valid customary 
						grant of said land from the lawful owners, who 
						incidentally are the appellant&#8217;s grantors. Under the 
						circumstances of his case, he was to prove that the said 
						C.K. Amoako and Mallam Issah Donkor had the authority of 
						the Obaapanin and Odikro at the time of alienate the 
						said land. The necessity of proving these persons 
						authority with particularly arises not only because of 
						(a) the state pleadings. (b) the persistent denials by 
						the incumbent Obaapanin PW1 that her predecessor 
						authorised the persons named but (c) because also of the 
						evidence of PW2, the liaison officer of the Kumasi 
						Traditional Council who deals mainly in land matters of 
						the traditional area. He is the person to whom the 
						appellant ran for refuge when he felt PW1 was wrongfully 
						dispossessing him of his lawfully acquired property. His 
						unchallenged testimony on the question of who ordinarily 
						or prima facie has authority to allocate Boadi stool 
						lands is as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;I 
						know that the occupant of Huahi stool is the person 
						authorised to allocate Boadi lands. In 1981, there was 
						no occupant of Huahi stool and so the Odikro and his 
						Obaapanin were the persons authorised to allocate lands 
						of the Huahi stool. The Obaapanin of the Odikro was 
						called Akosua Addai. The Odikro was also called Opanin 
						Kwadwo Dado of Boadi. In 1981, they had not allocated 
						any plots to the defendants.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It 
						is plain that where a party seeks to justify an action 
						which on the face of it is unlawful by alleging he had 
						authority so to act it is certainly incumbent upon him 
						to prove his authority clearly.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						Indeed the law which enjoins him to prove on the balance 
						of probabilities these matters i.e. that he had the 
						authority of the Obaapanin and Odikro to grant appellant 
						the land are S. 11 (1) and S. 14 of the Evidence Decree 
						1975 NRCD 323. They provide</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">

						producing evidence means the obligation of a party to 
						introduce sufficient evidence to avoid a ruling against

						(4) In other circumstances the burden of producing 
						evidence required a party to produce sufficient evidence 
						so that all the evidence, a reasonable mind could 
						conclude that the existence of a fact is more probable 
						than its non-existence. S 14 Except as otherwise 
						provided by law unless and it is shifted a party has the 
						burden of persuasion to each fact the existence or 
						non-existence of which is essential to the claim or 
						defense he is asserting, the importance of discharging 
						this burden cannot be over emphasised. Where he 
						succeeded in so doing and thereby clearly succeeds in 
						proving a prior oral customary grant, no amount of 
						subsequent conveyances, registered or not, can defeat 
						the customary title: (see Hammond vs. Odoi 1982-1983 GLR 
						1215 per Adade JSC at 1304.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						Having read the record, I find the appellant counsel 
						criticism of the learned trial judge, as may be gathered 
						from the various grounds of appeal wholly unjustified. 
						In other words, the learned trial judges findings both 
						in law and fact would clearly find support from the 
						record. Indeed it is difficult to fathom the inclusion 
						of the additional ground 3 which claims the learned 
						trial judge erred in holding that &#8220;the appellant&#8217;s 
						counter-claim should fail for non description of the 
						allotted plot&#8221; when she made no such finding. I do not 
						think the appellant succeeded in establishing the 
						critical matters raised by his own defense and 
						consequently he was unable to prove that he had as far 
						back as 1981 acquired a prior valid customary grant of 
						the said land.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						Quite apart from the reasons advanced by the trial judge 
						for dismissing his claim I find the evidence led on 
						these matters inconsistent and so wholly unreliable. In

						the subject matter of dispute was the subject on earlier 
						grant&#8230;by C.K. Amoako&#8230;&#8230;and Mallam Issah both acting for 
						and on behalf of the Obaapanin and Odikro his evidence 
						in chief on the question of who made the grant is 
						different. He disposed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						&#8220;On the agreed date J went with Mr. Asante to the Palace 
						of Boadi where we met C.K. Amoako. The Chief of the town 
						called Opanin Kwadwo Dado, the Obaapanin, Akosua Addai, 
						Mallam Issah Donkor and Opanin Amoah and elders were 
						also present. I told the chief and his Obaapanin that I 
						wanted a plot of land to work on. They said they will 
						give me the land. C.K. Amoako, Mallam Issah and another 
						were mandated to show me a plot of land. I gave a bottle 
						of schnapps. They brought out a plan and showed the 
						layout of the kind they were going to give me and they 
						showed me the land physically I expressed interest in 
						the land. I was asked to pay ¢6000 by the chief and 
						Obaapanin. There and then I paid the ¢6000 and was 
						issued with a receipt.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It 
						does come out from his evidence, which to my mind is at 
						variance with his own pleadings, that the persons who 
						granted him the land were the two who had power to do so 
						the Obaapanin and Odikro and not Amoako and Issah as he 
						had all the trial contended. His own account on the role 
						played by the two gentlemen including a third Amo, 
						namely that they were merely mandated to go and show him 
						the land would rather confirm the position of the 
						respondents that they had no authority to grant 
						Huahi-Boadi lands and more importantly, they had no 
						authority to alienate land to the appellant. Again their 
						inconsistency weakens or destroys their case (see Dam v. 
						Addo 1962 GLR.)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						Indeed the evidence of this DW2, the person he called to 
						prove that the grantors acted on authority and so had 
						the capacity, and power to alienate the land had a 
						double if not a triple negative effect on his case. His 
						evidence if it is to be believed disclosed that it was 
						the elders&#8212;Abusuapanin C.K. Amoako Akwasi Amo, 
						Krontihene Mr. Ampofor Opanin Dabo and Obaapanin Akosua 
						Addai who sold the appellant the land a contention which 
						my view is different from the facts pleaded.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						This also naturally raised the question, if the grant 
						was made by the elders, indeed if as he contends payment 
						was made to the Obaapanin who from his account did the 
						actual allocation, why do we have a receipt in the name 
						of C.K. AMOAKO? who is alleged to be acting on behalf of 
						the grantors. In my view then the authority of his 
						alleged grantors is being challenged he has to prove 
						their authority strictly. The best way to have proved 
						same was to have called the person who granted him the 
						authority i.e. Obaapanin Akosua Addae and or the Odikro. 
						He was quite understandably unable to call any of them 
						to testify. The Obaapanin is said to be incoherent. This 
						evidence came from the PWl since this evidence cause 
						from his opponent, on the authority of the principle 
						discernible in cases like</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						Osei Yaw vs. Domfeh 1965 GLR 418</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						Asante vs. Bogyabi &amp; anor., 1966 GLR 232 244 he cannot 
						be blamed for not producing her not the Odikro who is 
						dead.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						But for same reason which is not evident on the record 
						he never produced C.K. Amoako the principal actor in the 
						drama to the source of their authority, if any. That was 
						total liaison to testify. We have the unchallenged 
						evidence of the PW2 the officer in charge of Kumasi 
						Traditional Council to the effect that at the time of 
						the Exhibit 1 the Boadi laws had not come under 
						statutory planning scheme.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It 
						was intended to cast doubts on the genuiness of the 
						transaction for he also pointed out that the receipt did 
						not affect an allocation site and bore no plot number. 
						It was therefore essential to have called Amoako to 
						testify on the crucial matter of how he came by or 
						obtained his authority to grant land to the appellant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">Be 
						that as it may the evidence of the only witness he 
						called ought to have satisfied the court on these 
						matters. But he gave no evidence on when where and how 
						they were given authority to grant land. On the contrary 
						the evidence he gave showed that he himself made no such 
						grant as had been pleaded by the respondent. If his 
						evidence were anything to go by the only role they play 
						in the process was a caretakership role, looking after 
						the stool lands and pointing out to prospective grantees 
						land granted them by the lawful authorities. I do not 
						think the appellant succeeded in establishing the burden 
						that was placed on him. Question like why it took the 
						present Obaapanin that long before challenging the 
						authority of the appellant may be described as 
						weaknesses. These can be of benefit to the appellant 
						only if the respondent had succeeded in establishing his 
						title. It is then that he can successfully these matters 
						to strengthen his case and make the respondent 
						contention that they had no authority hollow and sham. 
						In other words he cannot use these weaknesses as proof 
						of the important matters in contention. I do not think 
						he is therefore entitled to judgment.</span></p>
