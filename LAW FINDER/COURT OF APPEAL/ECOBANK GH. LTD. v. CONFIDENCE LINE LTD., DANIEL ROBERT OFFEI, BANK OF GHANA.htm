						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">BENIN, J.A.: </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff is a 
						banking institution incorporated in Ghana. The 1st 
						defendant is a limited liability company registered in 
						Ghana to do business. The 2nd defendant is the Managing 
						Director of the 1st Defendant Company. The co-defendant 
						is the central bank of Ghana. Apart from the 
						co-defendant all the other parties at the trial court 
						are also parties to this appeal. The plaintiff&#8217;s case at 
						the trial court was very simple: that the 1st defendant 
						owed it some money arising from its account which it 
						operated with the bank. The facility which the plaintiff 
						granted the 1st defendant and which had resulted in the 
						indebtedness was guaranteed by the 2nd defendant, hence 
						the reliefs sought against the defendants jointly and 
						severally. In their statement of defence, the defendants 
						raised several queries against the claims by the 
						plaintiffs and went on to charge fraud against the 
						plaintiff, claiming, inter alia, that its account was 
						manipulated by the bank. Several issues were raised, 
						testified to, argued and decided upon by the trial 
						court. But in this appeal, one transaction only appears 
						to be in issue. It concerns the transfer of the sum of 
						FFR. 465,120 that the plaintiff transferred to Lome, 
						Togo, ostensibly to pay for a debt that the 1st 
						defendant was said to be owing a company in Togo. Indeed 
						that transfer was only a part of larger sums of money 
						the plaintiff transferred to Togo to pay for 20,000 bags 
						of sugar that the company in Togo had imported for the 
						1st defendant. There appears to be no quarrel with the 
						transfer to pay for the present order; the problem 
						relates to the transfer to pay for the existing debt. 
						These transfers were effected through a bank in Lome 
						called</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Ecobank, Lome, Togo, 
						and were intended for the company called ETS Confidence 
						Line, Togo, to whom the 1st defendant was indebted. It 
						turned out that this particular transfer was 
						subsequently ordered by the co-defendant to be cancelled 
						and the amount involved repatriated back to Ghana, which 
						order was duly carried out by the plaintiff. The issues 
						arising out of that transfer were: (i) whether or not it 
						was effected with the authorisation, apparent or 
						implied, of the 1st defendant; (ii) whether the transfer 
						was regular within the relevant laws, rules and/or 
						regulations of banking practice in the country; (iii) 
						whether the court below was justified in reversing the 
						interest charged by the plaintiff when the transfer was 
						cancelled and the sum involved repatriated back to the 
						country.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At this stage let me 
						briefly recount the facts. The 1st defendant placed an 
						order with Confidence Line, Togo, for the supply of a 
						quantity of sugar. The sugar was to be imported from a 
						firm in Europe and delivery was to take place through 
						the port of Tema in Ghana. The bankers of Confidence 
						Line, Togo, through which payment was to be effected was 
						Ecobank, Togo. Before the sugar could be sent to Ghana, 
						Ecobank Togo sent the shipping documents covering this 
						transaction to the plaintiff. And this singular act, 
						according to the defendants, compelled them (the 
						defendants) to deal with the plaintiff instead of the 
						defendants&#8217; own bankers, the Social Security Bank Ltd. 
						in Ghana. It appears the defendants did not have funds 
						to pay for the supply, so they entered into a credit 
						arrangement with the plaintiff for an amount of some 
						¢200,000,000.00 which the plaintiff advanced to the 1st 
						defendant with guarantee from the 2nd defendant. It is 
						necessary to recount the events culminating in this 
						advance and the speed at which it was done. On 20th 
						June, 1990, the 1st defendant opened a corporate current 
						account with the plaintiff, with an initial deposit of 
						¢200,000.00, as per Exhibit B. A day after this, to be 
						precise on 21st June, 1990, the 2nd defendant 
						surrendered the deed on his landed property to the 
						plaintiff as security for any money the plaintiff might 
						advance to the 1st defendant. Sooner than later, this 
						advance was made to the 1st defendant on the 27th June, 
						1990. Indeed the terms of this advance were contained in 
						an offer letter by the plaintiff dated 27 June, 1990, 
						which was accepted by the 1st defendant that same day. 
						The terms and conditions of this offer letter which the 
						defendants accepted provide a critical insight into our 
						consideration of the issue whether the transfer of funds 
						from the 1st defendant's account by the plaintiff was 
						authorised by the former, as urged by the plaintiff and 
						found by the trial court. These are spelt out in Exhibit 
						E. for its full force and effect, I propose to set out 
						Exhibit E. it provides:</span></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">These terms and 
						conditions were to be spelt out in a detailed written 
						agreement and executed by the parties. The 1st 
						defendant, as said earlier, accepted these terms and 
						conditions. The record shows that a formal agreement was 
						drawn up and executed on July 5, 1990, that is Exhibit 
						1. One thing is certain: the defendants do not dispute 
						that certain payments were made to them pursuant to this 
						agreement.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">From Exhibit E, no 
						mention is made that the plaintiff was also to pay for 
						any prior existing indebtedness of the 1st defendant to 
						Confidence Line, Togo, or for that matter any creditor 
						of the 1st defendant. Where then did the plaintiff 
						obtain the 1st defendant's authorisation to pay money to 
						Confidence Line, Togo, through Ecobank, Togo, for a debt 
						existing prior to the agreement to purchase the 20,000 
						bags of sugar? I'll refer to the trial court's decision 
						on this issue and then go on to find out whether it is 
						supported on the evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial court 
						referred to Exhibits D &amp; E, and concluded that it is 
						&#8220;not true as intimated by the defendants that they were 
						compelled to accept the financial facility from the 
						bank.&#8221; Exhibit D is a deed of indenture in which 
						reference is made to the security of a house provided by 
						the 2nd defendant for money to be advanced to the 1st 
						defendant by the plaintiff. I entirely agree with this 
						conclusion, for there is no basis to suggest the 1st 
						defendant be compelled to enter into this agreement. I 
						need not go into any details. The trial court then 
						considered Exhibit 1, which, as I said, was duly 
						executed by the parties. It seems the terms and 
						conditions of Exhibit 1 were slightly altered from those 
						contained in the initial offer&#8212;Exhibit E&#8212;which the 
						defendants had accepted. In Exhibit 1 the amount of the 
						facility had been reduced from ¢240 million to ¢200 
						million. And apart from paying for the 20,000 bags of 
						sugar that had been placed on order, the facility was 
						also extended to cover the payment of an existing debt 
						owed by the 1st defendant to Confidence Line, Togo. The 
						total foreign exchange involved amounted to FFR. 
						2,941,120.00 made up as follows: FFR. 2,476,000.00 to 
						pay for the fresh import of sugar; and FFR, 465,120.00 
						to pay for the existing debt. It is the latter payment, 
						which is in issue here.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It must be observed 
						that all this while, the Ecobank, Togo, which was to 
						receive payment for and on behalf of Confidence Line, 
						Togo, had surrendered all the relevant documents on the 
						import to the plaintiff, thereby placing the plaintiff 
						in the position of a collecting bank: that is, the 
						plaintiff was to receive the payment for the fresh sugar 
						import from the 1st defendant and transmit same to Togo. 
						The trial court found that following the execution of 
						Exhibit 1; the plaintiff released all the shipping 
						documents to the defendants. The court also found that 
						the plaintiff transferred the total sum of FFR 
						2,941,120.00 to Ecobank, Togo. These findings are 
						supported on the evidence. The court added that these 
						sums &#8220;were transferred to Togo in line with the credit 
						agreement, Exhibit One Going by the terms of Exhibit 
						One, the transfer of the amount of FFR. 2,476,000.00 
						covering the value of the sugar imported cannot be 
						unlawful. By Exhibit One, the 1st defendant was aware 
						that that money had to be paid into the account of 
						Confidence Line, Togo, with Ecobank, Togo upon receipt 
						of the documents covering the sugar import.&#8221; There is no 
						problem with this transfer. The problem is with the 
						transfer that was later repatriated upon the order of 
						the co-defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is the sum of 
						FFR465, 120.00 transferred to Ecobank, Togo ostensibly 
						to pay for a debt owed by the 1st defendant to 
						Confidence Line, Togo, on a previous sugar import. The 
						trial court held that this transfer was irregular. I 
						shall talk about this shortly. Even a cursory reading of 
						Exhibit 1 does not indicate that the plaintiff was to 
						transfer funds to Togo; it only talks about an advance 
						made by the plaintiff to the 1st defendant of certain 
						sums of money. But it does appear that by releasing the 
						shipping documents to the defendants, the parties knew 
						and very well understood that this should be done 
						against payment, thereby entitling the plaintiff to 
						transfer funds from the 1st defendant's account to pay 
						for the import as well as the existing debt, the very 
						purpose for which the advance was made under Exhibit 1. 
						This view finds support from the 2nd defendant himself. 
						This is what he said in his evidence-in-chief. &#8220;The 
						unique purpose of the facility was to pay for 20,000 
						bags of sugar valued at FFR. 2,476,000.00. Then pay for 
						a previous import valued at FFR. 465,120.00. Both 
						amounts totaling FFR, 2,941.120.00 were to be paid 
						directly to our suppliers' account with Ecobank, 
						Togo...The M. D. of the bank (plaintiff) confirmed that 
						all the three debits were utilised to purchase auction 
						funds at the Bank of Ghana and the French Francs had 
						been transferred to our suppliers account in Lome. I 
						believed the M.D. of the bank that our suppliers&#8217; 
						account in Lome had been credited with the amounts they 
						bought from Bank of Ghana...I went to Lome to cheek the 
						supp1iers&#8217; account and even though they said the money 
						had been transferred since 31-7-90 and 15-8-90, not a 
						single French Franc had been credited to our suppliers&#8217; 
						account up to the 25/9/90.&#8221; (The emphasis is mine.) 
						These facts were not in any dispute. The defendants&#8217; 
						only complaint therefore was that the transfer had not 
						actually reached their suppliers&#8217; account as agreed. 
						Their complaint was not that they had not authorised the 
						plaintiff to transfer these sums of money from their 
						account to Lome. In effect the defendants were 
						complaining that there was no transfer at all. And by 
						Exhibit 1, clause (e), interest was awardable only upon 
						actual sums disbursed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">What was the 
						plaintiff&#8217;s response? The plaintiff&#8217;s representative, 
						Mr. Nartey, rejected the claims by the plaintiff. For 
						this purpose he tendered a fax&#8212;Exhibit N&#8212;received from 
						Ecobank, Togo. This fax shows that the total sum of FFR. 
						2,941,000.00 plus interest thereon was received before 
						the maturity date of 25-9-90 and had been credited to 
						the account of the defendants&#8217; suppliers in Togo. There 
						is no indication as to what date this fax was sent, but 
						it was surely sent after 6th August, 1991, since it was 
						in response to one from the plaintiff dated the 6th of 
						August, 1991. There was no advice letter or slip issued 
						by Ecobank, Togo, to Confidence Line, Togo, that it had 
						indeed credited the latter's account with these sums of 
						money. Nor did it produce any statement of account 
						showing when, if at all, the credits were effected. On 
						the other hand, the defendants tendered in evidence 
						statements of account from Confidence Line, Togo, 
						showing that as at 31st December, 1990, these sums had 
						not been credited to its account in Togo. These are 
						Exhibits 5, 5A and 5B, even though these sums were 
						supposed to have been transferred and credited before 
						the maturity date of 25/9/90, as per Exhibit N.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The inferences to be 
						drawn from the accepted facts are these: the plaintiff 
						had the defendants&#8217; authorisation to transfer the two 
						sums of money to Togo to credit the account of 
						Confidence Line, Togo. The transfer was duly made to 
						Ecobank, Togo, but, for reasons, which do not appear on 
						the record, the amounts were not credited to the account 
						of Confidence Line, Togo at least as at December 31, 
						1990. The trial court&#8217;s conclusion that the moneys were 
						credited to the account of Confidence Line, Togo, is not 
						supported by the evidence. On this same issue, as late 
						as 30th January, 1992, Confidence Line, Togo, wrote to 
						the plaintiffs&#8212;see Exhibit 26&#8212;complaining that its 
						account with Ecobank, Togo, had never been credited with 
						the sum of FFR. 465,120, and had never received any such 
						advice from its bankers. The inference from this letter 
						is that the sum of money to pay for the fresh import had 
						been credited to its account. So the position was that 
						there was something going on between the two sister 
						banks which was unknown to the defendants; because the 
						money transferred to Togo was not credited to the 
						appropriate account as agreed upon, yet the plaintiff 
						did not explain, notwithstanding the defendants&#8217; 
						complaint.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">So only the two banks 
						knew where precisely the lodgement was being held. The 
						position then was that the plaintiff did not carry out 
						the terms of the defendants&#8217; authorisation. That alone 
						entitled the defendants to treat the agreement as 
						abrogated and therefore will not be liable to pay for 
						service not rendered.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I'll move on to the 
						next question whether the trial court was justified in 
						its holding that the transfer of the sum of FFR. 
						465,120.00 were irregular. As stated earlier, the 
						co-defendant ordered that this sum of money be 
						repatriated back to Ghana. This order was complied with 
						by the plaintiff. The trial court did not assign any 
						reason why it considered the transfer irregular, apart 
						from saying the co-defendant ordered its repatriation. 
						From the pleadings of the co-defendant, it ordered the 
						repatriation because the 1st defendant failed to submit 
						all the relevant documents concerning that transaction 
						to it contrary to laid down regulations. And they 
						averred that &#8220;it was the failure of the defendants to 
						provide the relevant documents that made the transfer 
						irregular.&#8221; At the material time, the co-defendant was 
						engaged in selling foreign exchange by auction. And for 
						that purpose it had published certain guidelines&#8212;Exhibit 
						T&#8212;to regulate, participation in the exercise. By Regn. 
						8.4 thereof, all relevant documents evidencing the 
						particular transaction for which foreign exchange had 
						been acquired were to be submitted to the co-defendant 
						within 14 days of the transaction. The co-defendant's 
						decision on any violation of these regulations was 
						final. The defendants failed to submit the documents 
						covering their indebtedness to Confidence Line, Togo, 
						for which the sum of FFR.465,120.00 was transferred to 
						Ecobank, Togo, by the plaintiff. It was the contention 
						of Counsel for the plaintiff that it was the defendants&#8217; 
						failure to submit the documents to them for onward 
						transmission to the co-defendant that resulted in the 
						latter cancelling the transfer and ordering its 
						repatriation. This failure to submit the documents to 
						the co-defendant is what has been described by the 
						co-defendant as making the transaction irregular, which 
						term was also followed by the trial court. If that is a 
						term used in banking practice to describe the given 
						scenario as irregular, so be it. It should not be given 
						any narrow, technical, legalistic meaning. The import of 
						the regulation was that if within 14 days of the foreign 
						exchange transaction the relevant documents have not 
						been transmitted to the co-defendant, it is entitled to 
						characterise the transaction as irregular and go on to 
						impose any sanction it deemed expedient. Whatever 
						description was given to a default under the regulation 
						8.4 was of no moment. And this was what precisely 
						happened here. Thus the court's acceptance and reliance 
						on the term &#8216;irregular&#8217; in describing the entire process 
						causes no harm if it's understood in the sense as used 
						by the bankers. And in my view that is the sense in 
						which it must be understood. Lawyers should not be 
						allowed to read technical legal meaning into what 
						otherwise appears to be a simple banking procedure. So 
						by saying the transaction was irregular all that the 
						co-defendant and the trial court were saying was that 
						the defendants failed to submit the documents to the 
						co-defendant within 14 days following the purchase of 
						the foreign exchange that was transferred to Togo. It 
						was this default by the defendants that led to the 
						irregularity, which thus compelled the co-defendant to 
						order the repatriation of the transferred funds. There 
						is thus no merit in the first ground of appeal and it's 
						accordingly dismissed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The second ground of 
						appeal states that since the trial court found the 
						transfer was authorised by the defendants, it erred in 
						holding it was irregular. I am at a loss what counsel 
						meant by this. Is counsel saying that once an act is 
						authorised to be done, it necessarily means it is a 
						regular act? They are two clearly distinguishable 
						matters, which even any English dictionary will confirm. 
						In this case the defendants authorised the transfer, but 
						its performance was irregular in terms of the 
						co-defendant's regulations&#8212;Exhibit T. There is thus 
						nothing wrong with the trial court's conclusion. Indeed 
						this ground of appeal is otiose and inconsequential.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">So following the 
						characterisation of the transaction as irregular, and 
						the order to repatriate same to Ghana, was the plaintiff 
						justified in retaining the interest charged for the 
						transferred sum, which was debited to the 1st 
						defendant's account? That is the subject of Ground 3 
						wherein the plaintiff contends that having held that the 
						defendants authorised the transfer to Togo, the trial 
						court erred in holding that the defendants were entitled 
						to a reversal of interest charged by the plaintiff on 
						the sum of FFR.465, 120.00. The defendants contend that 
						the money never reached its destination, as agreed, so 
						it was wrong to charge any interest against them. The 
						plaintiff is saying that since it was the default of the 
						defendants by not providing the documents that resulted 
						in the repatriation, the plaintiff was justified in 
						retaining the interest that had been charged to the 
						account after the transfer. The trial court's reason for 
						ordering a reversal of the interest was because the 
						transaction itself was declared irregular by the 
						co-defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There are several 
						facets to this issue. To begin with, it was the 
						defendants who authorised the transaction so they would 
						be bound to pay interest thereon as stated in Exhibit 1. 
						Next, the irregularity complained of by the co-defendant 
						leading to the repatriation order was brought about by 
						the defendants themselves who failed to deliver the 
						relevant documents to the plaintiff for onward 
						transmission to the co-defendant. Thus it could be 
						argued that having created the situation whereby the 
						transaction had been declared irregular, the defendants 
						should be held responsible for the consequences of their 
						inaction. But there is yet another aspect of this 
						matter. The plaintiff and its principal, the Ecobank, 
						Togo, have been found not to have credited the account 
						of the defendants&#8217; suppliers in Lome, namely, Confidence 
						Line, Togo, with the sum of FFR. 465,120.00, as agreed 
						upon between the plaintiff and defendants. So the 
						plaintiff was in breach of the agreement by 
						non-performance. Or could we talk of a failure of 
						consideration on the part of the plaintiff? It is my 
						view that so long as the plaintiff had not discharged 
						its obligations by getting the money to the account of 
						defendants' suppliers, which act the defendants had no 
						way of controlling, the plaintiff could not claim any 
						benefit by way of commission or interest on this 
						transfer. If the money had reached the account of 
						defendants&#8217; suppliers as stipulated under their 
						agreement but had been repatriated as a result of the 
						defendants&#8217; default in providing them with the 
						documents, then in such a situation the plaintiff would 
						have performed its side of the bargain thereby entitling 
						them to recover whatever they were entitled to. The 
						plaintiff could not be entitled to any benefit for any 
						part of the money that did not reach its anticipated 
						destination. It is for this reason that I agree that the 
						interest levied on this sum of FFR.465, 120.00 should be 
						reversed. I reject this ground of appeal accordingly.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the result I'll 
						dismiss the appeal by the plaintiff. There was a cross 
						appeal by the defendants. This was based on the 
						dismissal of certain reliefs the defendants had sought 
						against the plaintiff by way of a counter-claim. I 
						propose to consider them seriatim in the manner as 
						argued before this court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Relief (a)&#8212;General 
						Damages.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(i) The defendants&#8217; 
						contention was that the plaintiff, as banker, breached 
						its contractual and fiduciary duties to the defendants 
						resulting in damage. The charge is based on the fact 
						that the plaintiff is said to have opted to protect the 
						interest of Ecobank, Togo, as against that of the 
						defendants. The evidence on record is that the plaintiff 
						was acting as the collecting bank in place of Ecobank, 
						Togo. They were also the defendants&#8217; bankers, albeit for 
						the purpose of this transaction. So Counsel charges the 
						plaintiff with conflict of interest. I do not see 
						anything in law or on the facts which precluded the 
						plaintiff from acting in such dual capacity. It was for 
						Counsel to highlight any loss or damage that this has 
						caused the defendants. It&#8217;s not enough to merely accuse 
						the plaintiff of acting in a dual capacity thereby 
						creating a conflict of interest.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(ii) Counsel referred 
						to the mandate for opening of the account with the 
						plaintiff which, he said, provided that for foreign 
						exchange transactions only certain officers of the 1st 
						defendant could give authorisation. These included the 
						2nd defendant only. But according to Counsel the FFR. 
						465,120.00 was transferred without any such 
						authorisation. Counsel's submission, I am afraid, flies 
						in the face of the evidence of the 2nd defendant himself 
						which I have quoted earlier in this judgment in which he 
						had stated the plaintiff was to transfer this sum of 
						money to their suppliers' account in Lome.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(iii) Counsel said the 
						transfers made by the plaintiff to Togo were in breach 
						of Exhibit 1 under which the 1st defendant rather than 
						the plaintiff undertook to ensure the use of the 
						overdraft for the stated purpose. I must only point out 
						that this is also contrary to the same evidence of the 
						2nd defendant, which I quoted earlier. In other words, 
						the defendants had, as it were, compromised their rights 
						under the agreement and endorsed the transfer of funds 
						from their account to Togo; their only complaint, as I 
						said earlier, was that the money was not deposited in 
						the accounts of their suppliers.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(iv) Counsel's 
						contention is that the plaintiff was in breach of 
						contractual duty by debiting the 1st defendant's account 
						with the sums transferred without notifying them 
						(defendants) in good time. And moreover, those sums were 
						not credited to the suppliers' account. I think that 
						since the defendants had authorised the transfer, as 
						found already, failure to notify them in good time 
						causes no harm. The plaintiff has already suffered the 
						penalty for its failure to credit the suppliers&#8217; account 
						by having the interest it took being reversed on the 
						order of the court. Moreover the 1st defendant's account 
						was credited with the amount that was repatriated from 
						Togo.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(v) The plaintiff is 
						accused of transferring money to pay for 474 (out of the 
						20,000) bags of sugar, which never reached the 1st 
						defendant. I think this loss has been taken care of 
						already when the trial court found that the defendants 
						and co-defendant had reached a settlement whereby the 
						latter paid the former for this loss. There is no 
						specific appeal against this so as to compel this court 
						to investigate again whether in fact such a settlement 
						was reached.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(vi) This relates to 
						the failure to disclose to the defendants the rate at 
						which the plaintiff purchased the foreign exchange which 
						it transferred to Togo. I should think that the 
						authority to transfer funds to Togo to pay for sugar 
						imported from an EEC country, implied an authority to 
						purchase foreign exchange from the appropriate agency, 
						which at the time was the co-defendant. It was by 
						auction so the defendants would not have any control 
						over where to secure the foreign exchange and at what 
						rate. So the failure to disclose the rate could be 
						excused so long as the plaintiff exercised the 
						discretion which it had in the matter properly. The 
						defendants did not succeed in showing that the plaintiff 
						cheated them in this transaction or unjustly benefited 
						from the auction market.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(vii) The plaintiff is 
						accused of unjustifiably holding on to the 2nd 
						defendant&#8217;s title deeds even though the 1st defendant 
						did not owe the plaintiff. I think at the time the writ 
						was issued the plaintiff genuinely believed the 
						defendants owed them so much. It was the court, which 
						reversed the interest. The title deeds were used as 
						security for the advance and so long as any part of it 
						remained unpaid the plaintiff was at liberty to hold on 
						to them. When did the defendants completely pay off 
						their indebtedness to the plaintiff? When did the 
						plaintiff release the title deeds to them after they had 
						completed the re-payment, if at all? Did they make a 
						demand for their release which the plaintiff refused? 
						Did the refusal, if at all there was one, cause any harm 
						to the defendants? There was the need to establish 
						wrongful detention in the first place. If this was 
						established, the defendants would be entitled to some 
						damages, even if nominal, even if the wrongful detention 
						caused them no harm. Proof of harm may enhance the 
						quantum of damages that may be awarded. But there is no 
						sufficient evidence to establish these questions raised.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(viii) This is a 
						legitimate and valid point raised; that is, after the 
						sum of FFR. 465,120.00 had been repatriated from Lome 
						and its cedi equivalent had been credited to the 
						plaintiff by the co-defendant, the former failed to 
						credit same to the account of the 1st defendant 
						immediately or within a reasonable time. The relevant 
						testimony of the 2nd defendant was that the co-defendant 
						credited the cedi equivalent of the sum repatriated to 
						the plaintiff's account on 27-2-92. But it was not until 
						7 May, 1992, that the plaintiff credited the 1st 
						defendant's account with it. A letter from the 
						co-defendant&#8212;Exhibit 14&#8212;and the plaintiff&#8217;s advice 
						slip&#8212;Exhibit 15&#8212;were tendered in support. However 
						inefficient or busy the banking system might be, it 
						should not take more than three working days to credit a 
						customer's account with an amount that has arrived for 
						his credit. I'll therefore uphold this relief and hold 
						that the trial court erred in not granting the relief. 
						The plaintiff unjustifiably held on to the 1st 
						defendant's money thereby depriving them of the use of 
						it. The plaintiff will therefore be ordered to pay 
						damages in the sum of ¢ 2million to the 1st defendant, 
						taking into account the fact that the plaintiff must 
						have secured interest thereon for lending it out which 
						is their normal business to do. In other words, the 
						plaintiff received profit on this sum at the expense of 
						the customer. The amount involved being ¢19,542,109.83 
						is also taken into account.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Relief (e) This is 
						another way of re-arguing the previous point raised that 
						the transfer was unauthorised. This time the argument is 
						that the debits in the 1st defendant's account were 
						unauthorised and so should be reversed. But these debits 
						were the same or some of the amounts that were taken out 
						in order to purchase the foreign exchange. Or is the 1st 
						defendant saying that the amount with which the account 
						was overdrawn was not utilised for its own purposes? 
						That is the only time they can complain.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Relief (f). This has 
						been dealt with under Relief (a) viii above, so I need 
						not waste any more time on it, except to say the order 
						made thereunder is equally applicable here. No fresh 
						award will therefore be made.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Relief (i) Declaration 
						that all the transfers are irregular and unauthorised. 
						These issues have also been dealt with already when I 
						was considering the grounds of appeal raised by the 
						plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The cross-appeal will 
						therefore be dismissed except the damages awarded under 
						Reliefs (a) viii and (f).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">GBADEGBE, JA,:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have had the benefit 
						of the judgement delivered by my brother Benin JA and I 
						much say that I am in entire agreement with the 
						conclusions reached on the appeals before us.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I wish, however to make 
						an observation in respect of the order joining the Bank 
						of Ghana in the course of the action in the court below 
						as a co-defendant. Although the record of proceedings 
						before us does not have the proceedings of the exact 
						date on which the order was made it appears that the 
						same was made by the court on the 5th of April 1993 
						pursuant to a notice of motion by the defendants. (see 
						in particular para 3 of the Defendants&#8217; affidavit in 
						support of an application for judgement dated 1.6.93). 
						Again, the record clearly describes the said party as a 
						co-defendant. In my view, having regard to the fact that 
						from the proceedings there was nothing by way of 
						coterminous interest between the defendant and the bank, 
						the order for joinder as a Co-defendant was in error. In 
						fact, the proper thing which the defendant ought to have 
						done was simply to have joined the said bank as a 
						defendant to their counter-claim. I think the effect of 
						the rules when a party makes a counter-claim against the 
						plaintiff and seeks to have the said counter-claim or 
						any relief connected therewith along with another person 
						who is not a party to the proceedings is to simply add 
						the said party to his counter-claim. It repays for this 
						purpose to quote in extenso the provisions of order 15r 
						2(i) &amp; (ii) of LN 140A as amended by LI.</span></p>
