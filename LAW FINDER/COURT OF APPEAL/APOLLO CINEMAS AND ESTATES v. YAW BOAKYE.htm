						<span style="font-family: Arial">GBADEGBE, JA:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is an 
						interlocutory appeal from the ruling of an Accra High 
						Court whereby the learned trial judge refused an 
						application at the behest of the appellant (to whom I 
						shall for convenience in these proceedings refer to as 
						the plaintiff) for an order of interlocutory injunction 
						restraining the respondent (to whom I shall for 
						convenience in these proceedings refer to as the 
						defendant) from among others proceeding with a building 
						on the disputed land. The circumstances in which the 
						application with which we are now concerned are these. 
						The plaintiff claiming to be the owner of the disputed 
						property took out a writ of summons against the 
						respondent claiming a declaration of title, recovery of 
						possession, and general and special damages for trespass 
						as well as perpetual injunction on the ground that the 
						defendant had unlawfully entered its land and demolished 
						a building which was on the same and was in the process 
						of putting up a new building thereon. The defendant did 
						not deny the acts urged against him in particular the 
						demolition of an existing building on the disputed plot 
						but claimed that he had done so as of right having 
						acquired the land from a third party whom he alleged was 
						the real owner. It would appear that when after the 
						demolition of the existing building which the plaintiff 
						claimed as his the defendant had caused blocks to be 
						placed on the land with a view to erecting a new 
						building thereon the plaintiff applied to the court for 
						what was described as an interim injunction but which 
						having regard to the relief prayed for was in substance 
						an application for an interlocutory injunction. The said 
						application went through a full scale hearing the ruling 
						on which is the subject matter of these proceedings. As 
						said earlier on the learned trial judge dismissed the 
						application that sought essentially to have the 
						defendant restrained from proceeding with the building 
						works on the disputed plot. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Following the said 
						ruling the plaintiff has appealed to this court and 
						seeks to have the said order reversed on the grounds 
						urged in the notice of appeal dated 7-2-2000. Since this 
						appeal is from the exercise of a judicial discretion, I 
						think what this court has to consider is whether the 
						exercise of the said discretion was wrong? I wish in 
						particular to refer to the case of Re O (infants){1971} 
						2All ER 744 at 748 per Davies LJ as follows: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;In my considered 
						opinion the law now is that if an appellate court is 
						satisfied that the decision of the court below is wrong 
						it is its duty to say so and to act accordingly. This 
						applies whether the appeal is an interlocutory or a 
						final appeal,. &#8230;Every court has a duty to do its best to 
						arrive at a proper and just decision. And if an 
						appellate court is satisfied that the decision of the 
						court below is improper, unjust or wrong, then the 
						decision must be set aside. I am quite unable to 
						subscribe to the view that a decision must be treated as 
						sacrosanct because it was made in the exercise of 
						&#8216;discretion&#8217;: so to do&nbsp; might well perpetuate 
						injustice.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my view the above 
						statement of the law is in agreement with what was said 
						by the Supreme Court in Crenstil Vs. Crenstil [1962] 2 
						GLR 171 at 175 thus: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&#8220;An appeal against the 
						exercise of the court&#8217;s discretion can only succeed on 
						the ground that the discretion was exercised on wrong or 
						inadequate materials if it can be shown that the court 
						acted under a misapprehension of fact, in that it either 
						gave weight to irrelevant or unproved matters or omitted 
						to take relevant matter into account; but the appeal is 
						not from the discretion of the court to the discretion 
						of the appellate tribunal&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is important to bear 
						in mind that even where an appellate court would have 
						decided the case the other way it can only interfere 
						with the exercise of discretion if it comes to the view 
						that its exercise was wrong. Therefore, I proceed to 
						examine the materials, which were before the court below 
						to find out if the exercise of its discretion can be 
						said to have been wrong. Whiles both parties to the 
						action in the court below asserted rival claims of 
						ownership in respect of the disputed property there was 
						doubt as to which of them actually owned the land a 
						matter which required a decision of the court. Indeed 
						having regard to the pleadings filed in respect of which 
						directions had been filed though not taken there cannot 
						be any issue as to the frivolity of the action, it 
						having raised serious issues for trial it was necessary 
						that the status quo should be preserved until the 
						questions to be tried in the action were finally 
						disposed of. See-Texaco Ltd v Mulberry Filling Station 
						Ltd {1972} 1 All ER 513. Thus, in the said circumstance 
						the court below was required to have exercised its 
						discretion by considering the balance of convenience in 
						the event of a grant or a refusal of the application 
						mindful of the fact that its duty was to protect rights 
						or prevent injury according to legal principles. See-Aslatt 
						Southampton Corpn. (1880) 16 Ch D 143 at 148. The power 
						conferred on the court in such case is not arbitrary but 
						guided by regulated discretion in a manner which accords 
						with justice. Although it is impossible to lay down a 
						general guideline to regulate the court in all cases one 
						can say from the available case law on the point that 
						each case must be decided on the basis of fairness, 
						justice and common sense in relation to the peculiar 
						facts and law which arise in the matter. See-Hubbard v 
						Vosper {1972} 1 All ER 1023 at 1031, per Megaw LJ. In 
						the instant case whiles not disputing that neither party 
						had clearly established its right there was from the 
						processes filed a threat to the rights as asserted by 
						the plaintiff which if not restrained was likely to be 
						violated by the defendant if he was enabled to proceed 
						with his development works on the land having demolished 
						a building on the same which the plaintiff claimed as 
						his. The question which the court below in my view ought 
						to have considered as far as the relative balance of 
						convenience was concerned is the extent of disadvantage 
						to either party being incapable of compensation in 
						damages if at the end of a full scale trial or hearing 
						it succeeded in making out its case and the burden of 
						proving that the plaintiff would suffer a greater 
						inconvenience than that of the defendant lies on the 
						plaintiff, it having taken out the motion. See- (1) 
						American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd {1975} 1 All ER&nbsp; 504; 
						(2) Hampstead and Suburban Properties v Diomedous, 
						{1968] 3 All ER 545.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;I have carefully 
						examined the processes before us and in particular those 
						on which the discretion of the court below was based and 
						I am of the opinion that the exercise of the discretion 
						was wrong. In particular I am of the thinking that since 
						both parties were contesting substantially the same plot 
						of land it was incumbent on the court to have protected 
						them against any threatened violation of their alleged 
						rights to the land in respect of which they were 
						disputing otherwise at the end of the day one of them 
						would be deprived of the same. Considering the relative 
						inconvenience, which the plaintiff would suffer in the 
						event of a refusal if he should succeed at the end of 
						the day against that of the defendant, I think that the 
						balance tilts in favour of the plaintiff and for that 
						matter the application ought to have been acceded to. I 
						also think that what was in issue was the ownership of 
						the land and the anciliary right of its possession by 
						way of its development and therefore to have enabled the 
						defendant to proceed with his works on the land in the 
						absence of he having clearly established his right to 
						the land was wrong. I note in this regard that although 
						the learned trial judge in his ruling the subject matter 
						of these proceedings at page 50 lines 32-35 adverted her 
						mind to the relative inconvenience to the parties in the 
						event of a grant or refusal she answered the said 
						significant and or relevant question wrongly by 
						considering the matter as though the plaintiff was 
						unlikely to suffer any hardship or inconvenience if the 
						application was refused once he was compensated in 
						damages. I do not think that the mere fact that the 
						defendant subsequent to his self help of demolishing the 
						building which the plaintiff claimed as his and bringing 
						blocks on to the land had done that which tilted the 
						balance in his favour. On the contrary, I am of the 
						opinion after a consideration of their relative claims 
						and the inconvenience to be sustained by either of them 
						in the event of a grant or refusal of the interlocutory 
						injunction that the justice of the matter required that 
						the application be acceded to. I think that the refusal 
						of the application was an instance of injustice to the 
						plaintiff and this court having taken the view that the 
						refusal was wrong must set the said ruling aside. 
						Consequently, I hereby set aside the ruling the subject 
						matter of these appeal and in place thereof make an 
						order in terms of the motion filed before the trial 
						court until further or other order. The result is that 
						the appeal is 
						allowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
