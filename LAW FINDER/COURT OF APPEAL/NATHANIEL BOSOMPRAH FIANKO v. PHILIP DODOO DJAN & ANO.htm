												My Lords, we are in this appeal 
												which arises from the dismissal 
												of the appeal filed by the 
												plaintiffs/appellants 
												[hereinafter for convenience 
												referred to as the appellants] 
												against the decision of the High 
												Court, Accra concerned with the 
												question whether or not having 
												regard to the admitted evidence 
												as contained in the transcript 
												before the Court the verdict of 
												dismissal of the appellant&#8217;s 
												case in the court below was 
												right? In my opinion although 
												several grounds have been argued 
												by the appellants through their 
												counsel in the considerable 
												submissions filed before us our 
												task simply is to determine 
												whether the evidence contained 
												in the record of proceedings 
												justifies our intervention to 
												set aside the decision of the 
												High Court and in place thereof 
												substitute one allowing the 
												claim of the appellants as filed 
												before the trial court. In this 
												regard, I wish to say that I 
												shall in this delivery consider 
												the points raised by the instant 
												proceedings under two heads 
												commencing first with those 
												which touch and concern issues 
												of law and then lastly those 
												which turn on issues of fact. 
												Since those bordering purely on 
												matters of law such as the legal 
												effect of documents tendered by 
												the appellants against the case 
												set up by the defendants 
												[hereinafter for convenience 
												referred to as the respondents] 
												are likely to have a bearing on 
												the factual determination, I 
												wish to start from a 
												consideration of these before 
												turning to the factual 
												evaluation.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellants have argued that 
												the effect of the documents 
												which were admitted in evidence 
												such as the title deed of their 
												deceased father, the building 
												permit, the receipts for payment 
												of rates to the municipal 
												authority all of which bear his 
												name are more reliable by way of 
												proof of ownership to the 
												building in dispute than the 
												oral evidence which was led by 
												the respondents and which oral 
												evidence was at times 
												conflicting. Accordingly, it was 
												urged by them that this court 
												noting that the effect which the 
												High Court gave to these 
												documents was wring, a wrong 
												which has thereby occasioned 
												miscarriage of justice to them 
												should set aside the verdict 
												entered against them and allow 
												the appeal. I wish to observe of 
												this ground that whiles it is 
												true that in appropriate cases 
												the court should prefer 
												documentary evidence to that 
												which is oral this is purely 
												determined by the circumstances 
												which unfold from the record of 
												proceedings. In the instant case 
												it is my opinion that learned 
												counsel for the appellants has 
												placed a wrong interpretation on 
												what transpired in the court 
												below as far as the evidence 
												relating to the said documents 
												by way of the subsequent conduct 
												of the father of the appellants 
												goes. I think that his conduct 
												in turning over the rents from 
												the property to his younger 
												brother, the co-defendant [to 
												whom I shall for convenience 
												hereinafter refer to as the 
												co-respondent], as well as the 
												continuation of this practice by 
												his children even after his 
												death is a matter which raised 
												against him and his successors 
												in title a declaration against 
												interest which in the very 
												circumstances of this case 
												justified the conclusion which 
												the learned trial magistrate 
												came to a view which was rightly 
												affirmed by the High Court. I 
												also wish to say regarding these 
												documents that it is significant 
												that although the title deed, 
												exhibit 'B' was in his name the 
												documents covering this was in 
												the custody of the 
												co-respondent. In my opinion 
												these matters tended to dislodge 
												the evidential effect of these 
												documents bearing his name and 
												when placed against the 
												explanation of the co-respondent 
												that he provided the money 
												utilized in the building of the 
												disputed property looked more 
												probable to the trier of fact 
												than the version put up by the 
												appellants. I am therefore 
												unable to accept the arguments 
												urged on us by counsel by way of 
												seeking to impeach the effect 
												which was placed on the 
												documents by the High Court. 
												Then there is the resort to 
												provisions of the Evidence 
												Decree, NRCD.175. The argument 
												submitted to us on this was 
												based on section 25[1] which 
												reads as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Except as otherwise provided by 
												law, including a rule of equity, 
												the facts recited in a written 
												document are conclusively 
												presumed to be true as between 
												the parties to the instrument, 
												or their successors in 
												interest.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The submission which was placed 
												before us on the above section 
												by learned counsel for the 
												appellants was that since the 
												co-respondent had witnessed the 
												title deed in which the father 
												of the appellants was described 
												as the owner of the land he was 
												as estopped from asserting to 
												the contrary that he was in fact 
												the one who had provided the 
												money for the land. I wish to 
												say that I hold a contrary view. 
												In my opinion the section deals 
												with parties to an instrument 
												and it cannot be said that a 
												witness is a party to a deed of 
												conveyance for a party in its 
												ordinary or technical legal 
												meaning when used in relation to 
												a transaction refers those who 
												have entered into the 
												contractual relationship and who 
												by the contract have acquired 
												rights and obligations against 
												each other. In the instant case 
												this would refer to the persons 
												who executed exhibit 'B'. I 
												cannot see by what means it 
												could be legitimately said that 
												a person who only signs as a 
												witness to a contracting party 
												has by the very act of he being 
												a witness become a party to the 
												agreement which he has 
												witnessed. It is therefore 
												apparent that the section was 
												not rightly invoked by the 
												appellants. In any event since 
												before the making of exhibit 'B' 
												the father of the appellants 
												knew that he was just a bare 
												legal owner the beneficial 
												ownership being that of his 
												brother the co-respondent herein 
												I do think that the said 
												circumstance which was known to 
												him precluded him from setting 
												up a plea of estoppel by deed 
												against the co-respondent and 
												accordingly his successors in 
												title cannot rely on such a 
												plea; to do so would be 
												fraudulent one of the excepting 
												circumstances to which the 
												operation of section 25 of the 
												Evidence Decree is subject to. I 
												have in the course of this 
												judgment had regard to the 
												decision of the Supreme Court in 
												the case of Swiss African 
												Trading Co. Ltd vrs. Aryee 
												[1961] 1 GLR. 184 which 
												concerned the effect of a person 
												signing a deed as a witness and 
												would like to say that although 
												in that case the decision turned 
												on estoppel the considerations 
												leading to the decision are 
												quite dissimilar to those which 
												arise before us in these 
												proceedings and as such the 
												decision would not be applicable 
												to the instant case. In that 
												case, a brother signed as a 
												witness to a deed in which his 
												brother was described as the 
												owner. Subsequently when the 
												property in respect of which the 
												deed was made was being attached 
												in execution of a debt he 
												interpleaded saying that the 
												real nature of the transaction 
												was that he was a joint 
												purchaser of the property in 
												respect of which the deed was 
												made. The said plea was rejected 
												by the Supreme Court which held 
												that having admitted knowing 
												that the transaction was in 
												favour of his brother only he 
												cannot turn round to be relieved 
												from the consequences on the 
												sole ground that he was an 
												illiterate. It is quite clear 
												from his decision that the plea 
												set up was not rejected on the 
												ground of he being a party to 
												the deed by virtue of having 
												signed as a witness, in fact he 
												was not conceived of as such and 
												nowhere in the judgment was the 
												word &quot;party&quot; used to describe 
												him. I think that this decision 
												reinforces the opinion herein 
												that such a person is not a 
												party within the contemplation 
												of section 25 of the Evidence 
												Decree. The decision in the 
												Swiss African case [supra] can 
												also explained on the ground 
												that there was no other evidence 
												such as the subsequent conduct 
												of the one who alleged that he 
												was a joint owner unlike the 
												present case in which there is 
												substantial evidence that the 
												person described as the owner in 
												his own life conducted himself 
												in a manner inconsistent with 
												his ownership in favour of his 
												brother the co-respondent herein 
												which conduct was persisted in 
												by his successors. Further to 
												this, I think that the section 
												by itself mentions that it is 
												subject to the rules of equity 
												such as that which follows in 
												the next section-section 26 
												which deals with estoppel by 
												conduct. In my thinking section 
												26 of the Evidence Decree is a 
												statutory recognition of the 
												rule in equity described 
												commonly as estoppel by conduct 
												which is provided for as 
												follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Except as otherwise provided by 
												law, including a rule of equity, 
												when a party has by his own 
												statement, act or omission, 
												intentionally and deliberately 
												caused or permitted another 
												person to believe a thing to be 
												true and act upon such belief, 
												the truth of that thing shall be 
												conclusively presumed against 
												that party or his successors in 
												interest in any proceedings 
												between that party or his 
												successors in interest and such 
												relying person or his successors 
												in interest.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I think that in the case before 
												us since the conduct of the 
												father of the appellants as well 
												as his own children subsequent 
												to the making of the title deed, 
												exhibit 'B' not being consistent 
												with the recital in the deed on 
												which so much reliance has been 
												placed, it operated to defeat 
												whatever presumption arose from 
												the making of the same and 
												therefore by his conduct which 
												was continued by his children of 
												passing over the rents to the 
												co-respondent there can be no 
												question at all that his 
												subsequent conduct was for no 
												other reason than that the 
												disputed property belonged to 
												his younger brother, the 
												co-respondent. I need also 
												mention one other matter. It is 
												this. In our society 
												transactions such as those 
												relating to the purchase of 
												property on which so much 
												argument has been submitted to 
												us by the appellants must be 
												scrutinized by our courts when 
												the contest is between blood 
												relations and concerns the 
												determination of which of them 
												actually provided the purchase 
												money for we are aware of the 
												practice of brothers and sisters 
												buying property not in their own 
												name. It would appear therefore 
												that to seek to place a meaning 
												of the making of the document 
												only without an examination of 
												the surrounding circumstances in 
												which it came to be made might 
												not advance the interests of 
												justice. I am of the opinion 
												that in all probability having 
												regard to the conduct of the 
												father of the appellants in 
												turning over the rents to his 
												younger brother he was openly 
												acknowledging his role as his 
												benefactor as far as the 
												provision of shelter for him 
												goes and no wonder after his 
												death his own children continued 
												in that fashion. On the admitted 
												evidence therefore, I think that 
												there was no misappreciation of 
												the evidential value to be 
												attached to the documents and I 
												so hold. In fact, if I may go 
												further why did the appellants 
												not seek an explanation from 
												their father during his life 
												time over his conduct in handing 
												over the rents to his younger 
												brother who from the evidence of 
												the respondents which I accept 
												as true was better financially. 
												I think that the obvious answer 
												to this if indeed they never 
												sought to know is that their 
												father was not the owner of the 
												disputed building, its owner

												Now, I turn my attention to the 
												evaluation of the evidence. In 
												my view there can be no showing 
												after a critical examination of 
												the evidence on which the 
												findings of the trial court 
												which were affirmed by the court 
												below were based that the 
												conclusions reached were not 
												reasonable but perverse. I think 
												that the findings were amply 
												justified by the evidence and 
												since this was a province of the 
												trial court and the conclusions 
												reached were not unreasonable 
												the High Court was right in 
												affirming them. I think that it 
												is important to note in this 
												regard that even if upon a 
												consideration of the evidence 
												this court in the exercise of 
												its appellate jurisdiction comes 
												to the view that a decision the 
												other way is likely to be as 
												right as the decision appealed 
												from that by itself is not a 
												legitimate ground for setting 
												aside the decision appealed 
												from. But that is not all. In my 
												view since the said findings 
												have been made by two courts 
												concurrently for this court to 
												intervene it can only do so when 
												it is established with absolute 
												certainly that there was some 
												error or blunder resulting in a 
												miscarriage of justice. The said 
												error might arise from the 
												consideration of crucial 
												documentary evidence or an 
												erroneous application of rules 
												of evidence or an erroneous 
												proposition of the law which 
												when corrected might dissolve 
												the finding. See Achoro and 
												Another vrs. Akanfela [1996-97] 
												SCGLR.209. I must say that it 
												was precisely because of the 
												binding effect of this decision 
												that I commenced the 
												consideration of the instant 
												appeal from the grounds of 
												appeal that raised purely legal 
												matters and having come to the 
												view that there was no merit in 
												the attacks raised by the said 
												grounds. I think that the 
												findings need not be disturbed 
												on the ground that the 
												appellants have not succeeded in 
												justifying this appellate 
												court&#8217;s intervention in matters 
												which are purely factual by 
												demonstrating clearly that the 
												findings of the courts below are 
												wrong. On my own, having weighed 
												the probabilities which arise in 
												the case as best as I can, I am 
												unable to say with a tolerably 
												clear conviction that the 
												position asserted by the 
												co-respondent that he bought the 
												land and provided the money used 
												in putting up the disputed 
												property is not more probable.
