						<span style="font-family: Arial">LARTEY J.A: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This appeal is from the 
						decision of the Circuit Court, Takoradi delivered on the 
						27th day of November 2001.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">By his writ of summons 
						the first plaintiff claimed against the defendant the 
						following reliefs:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1. &quot;Recovery of House 
						Number 93/1 Kojokrom, via Sekondi.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2. Arrears of rent 
						collected from the tenants from January 1998 to date of 
						judgment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3. Perpetual injunction 
						restraining the defendant from the tenants resident in 
						House Number 93/1, Kojokrom.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Accompanying the writ 
						was the first plaintiff's statement of claim, which was 
						amended at the end of the trial. Incidentally, all the 
						parties in this action are brothers and sister. In his 
						amended statement of claim the first plaintiff avers 
						that the plot in dispute was gifted to the second 
						plaintiff by the late Nana Panyin Ye Na, their 
						stepfather, by reason of good service rendered by the 
						second plaintiff to the deceased, who requested the 
						first plaintiff to construct a house thereon for the 
						second plaintiff. In the amended statement of claim it 
						was alleged that the defendant who was on pension came 
						to stay in the house from Samreboi, but has arrogated to 
						himself ownership of the house and has been collecting 
						rent without the knowledge of the first plaintiff. The 
						first plaintiff also averred that sometime 1968 the 
						defendant was indebted to one Egya Kum in consequence of 
						which the house was attached, and it was the first 
						plaintiff who successfully claimed it through an 
						interpleader summons.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Similarly, the second 
						plaintiff who earlier on in the proceedings had 
						successfully applied to be made a party as second 
						plaintiff filed her amended statement of claim in which 
						she described herself as a sister to both the first 
						plaintiff and the defendant. She confirmed substantially 
						what the first plaintiff averred. She further alleged 
						that the first plaintiff gave 'Aseda' of one bottle 
						schnapps to the late Nana Panyin Ye Na II.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendant denied 
						all the allegation of facts contained in the statement 
						of claim. He contended that he acquired the plot in 
						dispute from the said Nana Panyin Ye Na in 1950 for a 
						consideration and later he put up two rooms where he was 
						residing until R.T. Briscoe, his employers, gave him a 
						bungalow. It was also his contention that he solely put 
						up the house from his own resources and that he 
						permitted the first plaintiff to occupy same as a 
						licensee. It was his case that he has been exercising 
						right of ownership on the house since 1950 without let 
						or hindrance, and therefore he is lawfully entitled to 
						any rent accruing there from. He denied the house ever 
						being attached by the said Egya Kum, and that there has 
						not been any occasion when the plaintiff through 
						interpleader summons had claimed it. The defendant 
						finally counter claimed for a declaration of title to 
						the disputed house and perpetual injunction restricting 
						the first plaintiff, his servants, agents or assigns 
						from having anything to do with the house.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At the trial, the 
						plaintiffs called two witnesses, one of who was PW1, 
						Kwaku Nyamekye, who described himself as the linguist to 
						the late chief of Kojokrom, Nana Panyin Ye Na. He 
						claimed to be present when a grant of the disputed plot 
						was made in favour of the first plaintiff by the said 
						chief for the purpose of building a house thereon for 
						the second plaintiff who had rendered meritorious 
						service to the chief. The witness also testified as to 
						the 'Aseda&#8217; of the bottle of drinks produced by the 
						first plaintiff and accepted by the chief who poured 
						libation with it. He further alleged being one of those 
						who inspected the plot.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After reviewing the 
						evidence produced by the parties, the trial judge 
						resolved the issue of capacity, which for the first time 
						was raised by counsel for the defendant in his address 
						at the end of the trial. The judge also dealt with the 
						issue as to which of the parties in the case built the 
						disputed house. Upon evaluating the whole of the 
						evidence, he consequently dismissed the defendant's 
						counterclaim and entered judgment for the plaintiffs for 
						the recovery of possession of the house.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is against this 
						judgment that the defendant launched this appeal to this 
						Court on the following grounds:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;(a) The judgment is 
						against the weight of evidence</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) The judge erred in 
						law when he held that the 1st plaintiff had capacity to 
						institute the action against the defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) The judge erred in 
						holding that the defendant's inability and or refusal to 
						call a witness was fatal to his case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d)&nbsp; The judge failed 
						to consider whether or not there was a valid gift to the 
						2nd plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(e) The judge erred in 
						law in entering judgment for the 2nd plaintiff who was 
						technically speaking not a party to the suit.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(f) The judge failed in 
						evaluating the evidence of PW1 who exhibited that he 
						could not be a witness of truth.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(g) Additional grounds 
						of appeal would be filed upon receipt of the record of 
						Appeal.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The argument which 
						learned counsel for the defendant argued in support of 
						grounds (e) was that the second plaintiff not having 
						been properly joined as a party to the suit, the trial 
						judge erred in law when he entered judgment for her. 
						Furthermore, that in her viva voce evidence the second 
						plaintiff gave her name as Ekua Awortwe even though 
						there is nothing on record to indicate that Ekua Awortwe 
						was the same person as Maame Awortwe who was joined to 
						the suit as second plaintiff. In support of his 
						argument, counsel purported to have relied on order 16 
						rule (8) of LI 1129, and submitted that by the second 
						plaintiff's failure to comply with the rule, her action 
						must fail.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It must be said in the 
						first place that Order 16 rule (8) of LI 1129 has no 
						relevance whatsoever to the case before us. That rule 
						relates to a judgment obtained between a defendant and a 
						third party, and it simply stipulates that where in an 
						action a defendant serves notice on a third party, the 
						court may during or after the trial, order the judgment 
						to be entered for the defendant against the third party 
						or for the third party against the defendant. It also 
						says in sub-rule (2) that where judgment is given 
						against the defendant and judgment is given for the 
						defendant against the third party, execution shall not 
						issue against the third party without the leave of the 
						court until the judgment against the defendant has been 
						satisfied. The rule as a whole has nothing to do with 
						the matter under consideration.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">However in fairness to 
						the defendant, it must be pointed out that the relevant 
						rule, which should have provided some guide to counsel 
						in his attack on the issue of the joinder of the second 
						plaintiff is Order 15 rule 6 of LI 1129, which deals 
						with misjoinder and nonjoinder of parties in an action. 
						In considering this rule we are unable to see how it can 
						be of aid to the contention that the second plaintiff 
						was improperly or unnecessarily made a party, for in 
						sub-rule (1) it has been clearly stated as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;No proceedings shall 
						be defeated by reason of the mis-joinder or non-joinder 
						of any party; and the court may in any proceedings 
						determine the issues or questions in dispute so far as 
						they affect the rights and interests of the persons who 
						are parties to the proceedings.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is in the light of 
						the foregoing that Lord Denning's dictum in Gurtner v. 
						Circuit &amp; Anor [1968] 2 Q.B. 587 at p.595 becomes 
						apposite. He states:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;It seems to me that 
						when two parties are in dispute in an action at law, and 
						the determination of that dispute will directly affect a 
						third party in his legal rights or in his pocket..... 
						then the court in its discretion may allow him to be 
						added as a party on such terms as it thinks fit. By so 
						doing, the court achieves the object of the rule. It 
						enables all matters in dispute to be effectually and 
						completely determined and adjudicated upon between all 
						those directly concerned in the outcome.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">No one can deny that 
						the second plaintiff was not an ordinary intervener; she 
						applied to be a party in the action for the purpose of 
						protecting her legal rights. And here the test as 
						proposed by Devlin J in Amon vs. Raphael Tuck &amp; Sons 
						Limited (1956) 1 Q.B. 357 becomes relevant: Would the 
						order for which the plaintiff was asking directly affect 
						the intervener not in his commercial interests, but in 
						the enjoyment of his legal right? Similarly, in the 
						local case of Aegis Shipping Co. Ltd (1973) 1 GLR 438 pp 
						443-444, the scope of the rule was explained to embrace 
						the absolute discretion of the court to determine 
						whether having regard to the nature of the pleadings and 
						the issues raised, the intervener is a person who ought 
						to have been joined, or he is a person whose presence 
						would enable the court, effectually and completely, to 
						decide the issues raised between the parties in the 
						cause or matter.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the present case we 
						are satisfied that the second plaintiff was properly 
						joined as a party in the action. She disclosed her 
						interest in the plot of land on which the house was 
						built. We are of the view that the court properly 
						exercised its discretion in granting the second 
						plaintiff's application for joinder. This ground of 
						appeal should fail.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In canvassing his 
						argument on the issue of the first plaintiff's alleged 
						lack of capacity, counsel for the defendant relied 
						heavily on the case of Sarkodee I vs. Boateng II 
						(1982-83) G.L.R 715 in an attempt to challenge the 
						capacity of the plaintiff, belatedly in counsel's 
						address to the court. The case, among others, dealt with 
						the issue of capacity to sue, and the principle 
						enunciated therein on the point was that where a 
						plaintiff whose capacity is challenged or put in issue 
						must establish it by cogent evidence. See also Chapman 
						vs. Ocloo &amp; Another (1957) WALR 84 and Sokpui II &amp; 
						others v Tay Agbozo III &amp; others (1951) 13 WACA, 241.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instant case, 
						there was no challenge whatsoever by the defendant 
						either in the pleadings or at the trial. In other words, 
						the capacity of the plaintiffs was never raised as an 
						issue. Admittedly, the issue of capacity may be raised 
						at any time, but it must be done timeously so as to 
						offer the party whose capacity is put in issue the 
						opportunity to establish it by cogent evidence. The 
						question that arises is how does the defendant's counsel 
						expect the plaintiff to provide the evidence to 
						establish capacity when counsel raised it for the first 
						time in his address? Clearly, it was failure of the 
						defendant to raise the issue of capacity before or 
						during the trial that disabled the first plaintiff to 
						prove his capacity to sue.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was also argued on 
						behalf of the defendant that the first plaintiff failed 
						to tender in evidence documents from the Shama Ahanta 
						East Metropolitan Assembly, in particular, exhibits 
						1-1F, indicating the plaintiff's interest in the land. 
						And that being the case there was no basis for the judge 
						to hold that the first plaintiff had any legal interest 
						in the land. We do not think that the documents per se 
						confer any right of ownership on the defendant. The 
						trial judge made a careful evaluation of the exhibits 
						and found that they were issues between 1999 and 2001. 
						And as the trial judge rightly observed, if the 
						defendant had been in possession of the house since 1982 
						why could he not tender similar documents in respect of 
						the previous years?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">No argument appears to 
						have been made for the rest of the grounds in this 
						appeal other than the capacity of the two plaintiffs. We 
						must say that we find nothing wrong with the decision of 
						the trial judge. We would therefore affirm the judgment 
						and dismiss the appeal with costs.</span></p>
