						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The central issue in 
						this appeal as indeed it was rightly found by the 
						learned trial judge, is whether the respondent 
						[defendant at the court below] is passing off its 
						electric fans as those of the appellant, plaintiff in 
						the said court, by similarity of the get-up of the 
						disputed fans.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff&#8217;s case 
						was that it had for a considerable length of time been 
						selling a type of electric fan with the name &#8220;Binatone&#8221; 
						but that quite recently the respondent has been dealing 
						in a fan named &#8220;MIKACHI&#8221; but the get-up is similar to 
						the appellant&#8217;s fan. The latter contends that this 
						conduct on the part of the former is injurious to its 
						trade or business and the appellant claims damages for 
						the fort of passing off its fans.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At page 659 of the 12th 
						Edition of Salmond On Torts, the learned author says:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;This gist of the 
						conception of passing off is that the goods are in 
						effect telling a falsehood about themselves, are saying 
						something about themselves which is calculated to 
						mislead. The law on this matter is designed to protect 
						traders against that form of unfair competition which 
						consists in acquiring for oneself, by means of false or 
						misleading devices, the benefit of the reputation 
						already achieved by rival traders.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned trial judge 
						dismissed the appellant&#8217;s claim and upheld the 
						counterclaim of the respondent and award it damages 
						arising from the loss of profits in business occasioned 
						by an injunction order obtained by the appellant against 
						the respondent at the initial stages of the institution 
						of the action.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellant&#8217;s 
						Counsel&#8217;s main ground of appeal is that a substantial 
						miscarriage of justice has been occasioned by the 
						learned trial judge&#8217;s failure to inspect, examine, look 
						at and compare the get-up in the fans exhibited at the 
						court to detect properly the similarities with a view to 
						determining whether there was a case, of passing off. In 
						his statement of case the appellant&#8217;s counsel stated at 
						p.3 thereof:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The 
						plaintiff/appellant will at the hearing of this appeal 
						respectfully invite the court to inspect and examine the 
						exhibits in the case.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Council further 
						submitted the following at p.4 of his statement of 
						case:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Comparison of the fans 
						reveals similarity of the get-up ranging from colour to 
						inscriptions, raising strong likelihood of confusion [in 
						the minds of the public.] [Emphasis mine]&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is my view that 
						since the appellant tendered in evidence the 
						controversial fans, the learned trial judge must be 
						deemed to have had a look at them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In fact, reading 
						through the judgment, it is quite clear that she did. 
						The learned trial judge, if I understood her judgment 
						very well, had the get-up of the fans tendered at the 
						back of her mind when she wrote her judgment. What is 
						clearly noticeable in the judgment is that she took into 
						serious consideration the character and level of 
						intelligence of the ordinary Ghanaian consumer looking 
						for a fan to buy and using this as a guidepost, she then 
						set herself the question of whether such a customer 
						would be deceived in his or her mind as to the identity 
						of a fan sold by the appellant and another sold by the 
						respondent and using what she thought to be the 
						conspicuous distinctive features in the two fans 
						&#8220;Binatone&#8221; and &#8220;Mikachi&#8221; arrived at the conclusion that 
						there was no such evidence of the likelihood of 
						deception proved by the appellant. Looking at the 
						evidence adduced at the trial, I was unable to fault her 
						approach and the conclusion she reached. The learned 
						trial judge hit the nail right on the head when she 
						stated in her judgment at page 97 thus:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;for in our part of the 
						world where a greater majority of our people know next 
						to nothing about warranties, a party buying a standing 
						fan generally goes by the brand name the assembled fans 
						are then tested and taken away in that manner.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Yet another 
						unimpeachable and persuasive portion of the judgment 
						must be quoted and it is at p. 98 thus:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The plaintiff and the 
						defendant deal in different and distinctive brand of 
						goods Binatone and Mikachi, no shred of evidence was led 
						as to the defendants appropriating the plaintiff&#8217;s 
						goodwill. It is evident that the plaintiff has 
						established its reputation and good will in Binatone and 
						in the absence of evidence that the defendant deals in 
						those products, the defendant cannot be said to have 
						passed off the plaintiff&#8217;s products.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Throughout the 
						statement of case submitted on behalf of the appellant 
						no portion of it talks of the oral testimonies of the 
						appellant and to its witnesses some of whom were 
						subjected to scathing cross-examination as exemplied 
						amply by the address filed on behalf of the defendant as 
						affording satisfactory proof of the respondent 
						appropriating the appellant&#8217;s goodwill.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellant now 
						invites this court to inspect the fans or exhibits 
						tendered at the court below to form our own view.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I am afraid this court 
						would not accede to this invitation, simply because it 
						is not a trial court. What counsel for the appellant 
						wants this court to do in effect is to move to the locus 
						in quo and make primary findings. This function is by 
						law given to the trier of fact, not this court: See 
						section 68 of the Courts Act 1993 [Act 459].</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There is yet another 
						important aspect of the evidence which the learned trial 
						judge considered and which appeals to me as very vital. 
						The learned trial judge made a positive finding which 
						cannot be disputed that because the two companies 
						litigating admitted it, that the fans in both cases are 
						not manufactured according to the specifications of both 
						the appellant and the respondent companies. She then 
						stated the law as enunciated in the English case of AB 
						Manus v. R. J. Fullwood &amp; Bland Ltd. 1949 ch 208 and 
						held that it did not lie in the mouth of any of the two 
						companies to complain except where it could be proved 
						that the importer [any of the two] had been perceived as 
						the true source of the goods, that is to say, as the 
						manufacturers. In the instant case, there was no such 
						evidence before the court. On the totality of the 
						evidence I have not been persuaded to reverse the 
						decision of the trial court. It follows that the appeal 
						ought to and it is accordingly dismissed. Costs of ¢1 
						million for respondent.</span></p>
