						<span style="font-family: Arial">ANSAH, JA : </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is&nbsp; an appeal 
						against the judgment&nbsp; of an Accra High Court delivered 
						on 15th December 1999.&nbsp; As per their writ of summons, 
						the plaintiffs claimed the following reliefs against the 
						defendants, namely:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a)&nbsp; Declaration that 
						plaintiffs&#8217; redeployment or termination of their 
						appointment or howsoever called, is wrongful and 
						unlawful, null and void of no legal effect;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) Order that 
						Defendants pay to Plaintiffs their due entitlements 
						under the provident fund scheme.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c)&nbsp; Compensation for 
						wrongful termination of appointment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d) Order that 
						Defendants (sic Plaintiffs) be paid their accrued 
						salaries from the date of their pretended termination or 
						re-deployment until the final determination of their 
						status with the Defendant Corporation, or in the 
						alternative.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(e)&nbsp; An order 
						compelling Defendants to go by the laid down provisions 
						for the payment of End of Service Award under the 
						Collective Bargaining Agreement.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In his judgment after 
						the trial of the case, the trial judge said, in entering 
						judgment for the plaintiffs that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a)&nbsp; &#8220;The Defendant 
						Corporation was right in terminating the appointments of 
						Plaintiffs.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b)&nbsp; Defendant 
						Corporation is to compute Plaintiffs&#8217; entitlements by 
						reference to Section 28(4) of the Collective Bargaining 
						Agreement and in particular the Defendant must apply the 
						salary of each plaintiff at the point of re-deployment 
						on 20/10/93. From this should be deducted whatever has 
						already been paid to each plaintiff. The difference is 
						to attract interest.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) Defendant 
						Corporation is to provide each Plaintiff with a 
						statement of account of his Provident fund contribution 
						to determine if there has been any under-payment. Any 
						difference should be paid back to Plaintiffs with 
						interest; and </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d) The severance award 
						of two months&#8217; salary and four months&#8217; salary 
						respectively paid to Junior and Senior Staffs should not 
						be disturbed by the court. In order words the claim for 
						enhancement of the awards is dismissed&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">All the trial, the 
						plaintiffs said that they were employees of the 
						Defendant Corporation.&nbsp; It was on 28/10/92 when they 
						were told that their employment with the corporation had 
						been terminated.&nbsp; In fact they were 155 in all and the 
						plaintiffs were only some of them. Meanwhile, their 
						appointments were governed by a Collective Bargaining 
						Agreement.&nbsp; In a Certificate of Service issued to each 
						of them after the dismissals, the reason given for their 
						dismissals was that they were being re-deployed. The 
						plaintiffs complained that they worked very diligently 
						with the Defendant Corporation and so much without any 
						blemish that they did not deserve to be treated that 
						way.&nbsp; They also said that they contributed into some 
						funds in the hope and belief that in the event of 
						leaving the employ of the Defendant Corporation they 
						would be paid back to them. Their hopes did not 
						materialize for nothing was ever paid to them.&nbsp; To 
						vindicate their rights under the terms of the collective 
						agreement, they instituted the action that culminated in 
						the judgment under appeal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendant on the 
						other hand did not agree that there were any sums of 
						money to be paid to the plaintiffs for they had paid all 
						their entitlements under the collective agreement to 
						them in full.&nbsp; In so doing, they had the full backing in 
						the form of a fiat of the Ministry of Labor and Social 
						Welfare.&nbsp; Originally, the Defendant Corporation filed 
						six grounds of appeal including the omnibus ground that 
						the judgment was against the weight of evidence.&nbsp; This 
						ground was later abandoned.&nbsp; Other grounds of appeal 
						were that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;2(b) that the Learned 
						Trial Judge misdirected himself on the evidence when he 
						stated that Defendant&#8217;s conduct in freezing plaintiffs&#8217; 
						entitlement under Section 28.04 was not only wrongful 
						but also led to various diminutions in the Plaintiffs&#8217; 
						entitlement.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">That the trial judge 
						failed to adequately consider that the freezing of the 
						Plaintiffs&#8217; entitlement was a Government decision, which 
						was accepted by representatives of employees including 
						plaintiffs.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) That the learned 
						trial judge erred in law when he held that the freezing 
						of the End of Service Benefits was contrary to law even 
						though it was by a Government directive;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) The Learned Trial 
						Judge erred in law when he failed to consider that under 
						the Transitional Provisions of the 1992 Constitution 
						such a directive cannot be entertained by any Court of 
						Law;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) The Learned Trial 
						Judge erred in law when he held that Defendant was to 
						provide each plaintiff with a statement of Account of 
						his Provident Fund Contribution when the same was not 
						claimed even though in evidence the plaintiffs claimed 
						they had not been given a statement&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This appeal is seeking 
						an order to set aside that part of the judgment that 
						dealt with Paragraph 2 set out above. Counsel for the 
						appellants argued 2(b), (c) and (a), (b) and (c) which 
						with the permission of the court now read&nbsp; (d), (e) and 
						(f), together. The submission in support of these 
						grounds was that one James Baiden, giving evidence for 
						himself and the other plaintiffs said that he was paid 
						¢3,326,234.94 out of which ¢2,743,356.00 was for an End 
						of Service Benefit (E.S.B).&nbsp; In so doing, the defendant 
						failed to comply with Section 28.04 of the collective 
						Bargaining Agreement.&nbsp; That was Exhibit B at the trial.&nbsp; 
						Counsel drew attention to the fact that as per Exhibit 
						G, the balance left unpaid of the E.S.B was 60% of the 
						total and that was ¢1,646,014.53.&nbsp; James Baiden however 
						admitted later that it had been paid to him.&nbsp; His 
						complaint was that if he had been paid under the heading 
						&#8220;redeployment&#8221; he would have received a higher sum of 
						money.&nbsp; Counsel pointed out that term was unknown to 
						Exhibit B, the collective agreement.&nbsp; Concerning the End 
						of Service Award in Exhibit B, counsel maintained that 
						it was the same as End of Service Benefit that was 
						abolished by the Government in 1990.&nbsp; I must pause here 
						and refer to the said Section 28.04 of the collective 
						agreement. It was what was to be paid to employees on 
						their leaving the service of the Corporation, other than 
						summary dismissal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">That the E.S.B that 
						inarguably was said to be the same as End of Service 
						Award, was frozen in 1990 by the Government was 
						confirmed in evidence by the Representative of the Chief 
						Labour Officer, Mr. Adisa Sulley.&nbsp; I have no reason to 
						doubt his veracity on this assertion, for, who and when 
						the E.S.B was frozen is a notorious fact of which this 
						court can take judicial notice. The learned trial judge 
						took due notice of the E.S.A or E.S.B and commented thus 
						on it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;It therefore means 
						that whatever agreement may have been reached by the 
						Tripartite Committee to freeze the E.S.A would be in 
						direct conflict with S. 28.04 of exhibit &#8216;B&#8217;, since the 
						said E.S.A was to be paid to employees of Defendant 
						Corporation on death or on leaving the service of the 
						Corporation other than on summary dismissal&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was pointed out that 
						the Government froze all E.S.Bs itself but not by the 
						Tripartite Committee as the judge held.&nbsp; If he had 
						appreciated that point correctly, he would not have said 
						that what the Committee did was inconsistent with the 
						Collective Agreement and sinned against Section 10(4) of 
						the Industrial Relations Act 1965, Act 299, and for that 
						reason was wrongful and a diminution of the plaintiffs&#8217; 
						entitlements.&nbsp; By taking that line the trial judge, it 
						was submitted, disabled himself from considering whether 
						the decision by Government to freeze the E.S.B/E.S.A. 
						was unlawful or wrongful.&nbsp; It was emphasized upon that 
						it was the then P.N.D.C Government itself that froze the 
						end of service benefits in 1990.&nbsp; As and act by the 
						Government, it could not be questioned in any court of 
						law under Provision 34(5) of the Transitional Provisions 
						of the 1992 Constitution.&nbsp; As stated the submission on 
						the Transitional Provisions were marshaled in support of 
						grounds 2(b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of appeal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The reply by counsel 
						for the respondent was a three-fold denial of the 
						invocation of the said transitional provisions. It was 
						submitted that the appeal to those provisions was 
						totally misconceived. Also that the courts&#8217; attitude to 
						provisions that tend to oust their jurisdiction was one 
						of repulsion and abhorrence and thirdly that the 
						conditions necessary in order to successfully invoke the 
						ouster clause did not obtain in this case. The argument 
						in support of the first point raised was that going by 
						what a learned author, S.Y. Bimpong-Buta wrote at page 
						253 in his invaluable book, &#8220; &#8220;The Law of Interpretation 
						in Ghana&#8211;Exposition and Critiques&#8221; that &#8220; to take away 
						the power of jurisdiction of all Courts or Tribunals to 
						entertain any proceedings or grant any order in respect 
						of any &#8216;matter relating to the unconstitutional and 
						violent overthrow of the Government of Ghana by a coup 
						d&#8217;etat&#8221; was the primary objection of the whole of 
						Section 34 of the Constitution.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">What the defendant did 
						in this case was not for the sake of any matter covered 
						or envisaged under this provision, namely, the 
						unconstitutional and violent overthrow of the Government 
						of Ghana, or a coup d&#8217; etat.&nbsp; Rather it was a mere 
						industrial dispute that cannot be equated with what had 
						been proscribed by the constitution. The two other 
						grounds canvassed in support of the opposition to the 
						reliance of the transitional provisions were that there 
						is a judicial frown against them as was exemplified by 
						the case of Republic v. Court of Appeal &amp; Others; Ex 
						parte Agyekum [1982-83] GLR 688.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I think it is not very 
						necessary to continue to set out the unending arguments 
						on the transitional provision and their efficacy in this 
						judgment.&nbsp; I think the pivotal issues in this case must 
						be gleaned from the claims put before the court and the 
						evidence led in support thereof.&nbsp; It was simply put a 
						claim for the payment of what the plaintiffs perceived 
						to be their entitlements upon leaving the employment of 
						the defendant. The plaintiffs thought that they were 
						entitled to receive an end of service benefits under the 
						collective agreements, among others.&nbsp; They put in a 
						claim for that relief.&nbsp; The trial judge apparently 
						agreed that the plaintiffs were so entitled.&nbsp; He 
						reasoned that the freezing of the end of service 
						benefits was a contravention of sections of the 
						Industrial Relations Act and was on account of that 
						wrongful. It mattered very little that he erred when he 
						said it was the Tripartite Committee that froze the 
						E.S.B.&nbsp; It was clear that it was the act of freezing the 
						end of service benefit that he condemned and not because 
						it was frozen by the committee. The significance in the 
						Kwakye case lay in the fact that it lay it down that a 
						successful invocation of the indemnity provisions in the 
						Constitution was predicated upon a demonstration of the 
						factual situation. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Admittedly, it must be 
						demonstrated to the court that the P.N.D.C Government in 
						fact issued a circular to freeze all Ends of service 
						benefits.&nbsp; One of the surest ways to do this was to have 
						just produced the circular.&nbsp; I subscribe to the view 
						that this was not the only way to prove this fact in 
						law.&nbsp; A certified true copy would serve the same 
						purpose. Yet another mode is for the court to take 
						judicial notice of the existence of such a circular.&nbsp; It 
						was all too clear that the trial judge was aware of the 
						freeze; he only fell into the egregious error that it 
						was by an agreement by the Tripartite Committee. It was 
						manifestly an executive act of the Government of the 
						day. The defendant was bound to follow it. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Section 34(5) of the 
						Transitional Provisions has been the subject of 
						interpretation in the Kwakye case.&nbsp; I do not attempt to 
						further construe it, seeing also that to do so is to 
						wander into an area reserved for the Supreme Court.&nbsp; I 
						only quote it in full now.&nbsp; It reads as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;5. It is not lawful 
						for any court or tribunal to entertain an action 
						instituted in respect of an act or omission against a 
						person acting or omitting to act on the instructions or 
						authority of the Provisional National Defense Council or 
						the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council or a member of 
						the Provisional National Defense Council or the Armed 
						Forces Revolutionary Council and alleged to be in 
						contravention of any law, whether substantive or 
						procedural, in existence before or during the 
						administration of the Provisional National Defense 
						Council or the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this case the 
						defendant purported to act on the circular 
						aforementioned in freezing the end of service benefits. 
						They were acting on the instructions of the P.N.D.C. The 
						trial judge said that the circular sinned against the 
						law of the land governing workers and their employers 
						and regarding agreement on how much benefits was 
						contrary to law.&nbsp; The first plaintiff did not mince his 
						words when he said that even though he had been paid the 
						whole of his benefits by giving first 40% of it and 
						later the balance of 60%.&nbsp; I think all the conditions 
						necessary to invoke section 34(5) of the Transitional 
						Provisions were satisfied.&nbsp; It was unlawful for the 
						judge to have entertained the claim for an order as was 
						put in by claim (e). He should not have made an order to 
						compel the defendants to compute the awards for the 
						plaintiffs under the severance awards provisions of the 
						collective agreement. I think the trial judge 
						misdirected himself by not directing his attention to 
						the ouster clause in the transitional provisions and 
						Section 34(5) in particular.&nbsp; He erred in this wise.&nbsp; In 
						consequence the able submissions in support of grounds 2 
						of the appeal are upheld.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">By way of a brief 
						observation, no matter how one look at the ouster clause 
						of those provisions, sight must not be lost the purpose 
						they tend to serve in some respects, limited though they 
						may seem to be. In this case in particular, the then 
						P.N.D.C Government took the step of freezing but not 
						cancelling Ends of Service Benefits indefinitely.&nbsp; It 
						may seem unpalatable and even inimical to the overall 
						interest of the ordinary worker but that was the policy 
						of the Government of the day.&nbsp; We are very much aware of 
						efforts to do away with the policy so as to give some 
						ray of hope to the worker especially on his retiring 
						from employment.&nbsp; It is the wish of the Ghanaian worker 
						that sooner than later the freeze would be lifted and&nbsp; 
						many are looking forward to that day with much 
						expectation. As stated earlier, the task of pronouncing 
						on the validity or otherwise of the transitional 
						provisions or any part thereof is in excusive 
						jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and our wings are 
						clipped and our mouths zipped from commenting or even 
						attempting to interpret them.&nbsp; For the meantime we allow 
						the appeal on grounds two.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We do not say the same 
						for ground three.&nbsp; Admittedly, nowhere in the writ of 
						summons was any claim put in for accounts on the 
						Provident Fund to be furnished the plaintiffs.&nbsp; But the 
						answer to this ground is found in Order 20r5, which 
						provide that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;5. Every statement of 
						claim shall state specifically the relief which the 
						plaintiff claims either simply or in the alternative, 
						and it shall not be necessary to ask for general or 
						other relief, which may also be given, as the judge or 
						court may think just, to the same extent as if it had 
						been asked for &#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have looked at the 
						amended statement of claim and found that it did not 
						contain any claim for account on the Provident Fund but 
						the rule afore-mentioned permits the trial court to give 
						a relief that has not been asked for. The provision is 
						that the judge would use his discretion in making or 
						awarding that relief. The most important consideration 
						is whether or not there was enough evidence on the 
						record to support such a relief being granted. For all 
						that was said, nothing appeared that there was no 
						evidence in support of the order for accounts on the 
						Provident Funds.&nbsp; Consequently we do not find any merit 
						in that ground of appeal and we dismiss it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We also do not find any 
						reason to vary the judgment as a whole and we refuse the 
						invitation to us to vary it.</span></p>
