						<span style="font-family: Arial">QUAYE J.A.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;This appeal is from 
						the decision of the High Court, Kumasi, given on 30th 
						May, 1996 in favour of the plaintiff/respondent (herein 
						called the respondent), By his writ of summons filed on 
						3rd June, 1985 the respondent herein endorsed a claim 
						for&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) a declaration that 
						all piece of land situate at a place known and commonly 
						called BESEHO AHOREYE at Aburom near Saman on Kwabere 
						Kenyase Stool land and having boundaries with Odumanafo 
						Stool land, Saman Dikro's farm land, Opanin Asuria of 
						Konkodie's land, the land of Serwaa Akoto and the Stool 
						land of Abodwese and measuring about 50.59 acres more or 
						less........is property of plaintiffs material family</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) .........a 
						declaration that the land described........above was the 
						subject of a pledge by the plaintiff's predecessor Kofi 
						Duro for the sum of four pounds thirteen shillings 
						£4.13/-</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) An order against 
						the defendant for the redemption of the land described 
						....above by the payment to the defendant by plaintiff 
						of the said sum of £4.13/-.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d) An order of 
						perpetual injunction to restrain defendant, his 
						servants, Agents and assigns from interfering with the 
						plaintiffs right in the said land.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The crux of the action 
						therefore appears to be firstly to declare or confirm 
						the ownership of the defined subject land in the 
						respondent, and when that hurdle of ownership had been 
						cleared in favour of the respondent, for the court to 
						proceed to make a second finding that the said piece of 
						property measuring some fifty acres or more, was subject 
						of a pledge by the predecessors of the respondent to 
						those of the defendant/appellant (in the Judgment simply 
						referred to as appellant) By his defence, the appellant 
						merely claimed his family ownership of the subject 
						property and counterclaimed for a declaration of title 
						thereto and also for an order of perpetual injunction 
						against the respondent and his family.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The respondent gave 
						evidence and was supported by three witnesses who 
						testified as boundary owners and related what they know, 
						observed or had been handed down by traditional evidence 
						to them respecting the disputed land. His evidence 
						centered on how the disputed land came to be owned by 
						his family. According to the unchallenged evidence of 
						the respondent an ancestress of his, by the name Nana 
						Adwapa was married to one Nana Antwi Kofi the then 
						Kenyasehene, and as the custom invariably was, the 
						husband/chief sealed off the marriage with a gift of the 
						disputed land to his said wife. The respondent named one 
						Boadu Twafo the Kenyase Twafohene as the one who 
						physically demarcated the land to the respondent's 
						ancestress Nana Adwapa. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As was stated earlier 
						on this Judgment, the above evidence which materially 
						shows how the land was acquired, and underscores the 
						respondent's claim for a declaration of title, was 
						neither disputed nor challenged even in the remotest 
						terms by the appellant. The issue as to whether or not 
						the subject matter of this dispute was a gift to a 
						predecessor of the respondent by one Barima Antwi Kofi, 
						Kenyasehene, therefore needed no further evidence of 
						proof. The bare denial in his pleadings by the appellant 
						of the respondent's contention in his statement of claim 
						on the issue, was not sufficient to discharge the onus 
						upon the appellant to traverse specifically and 
						unequivocally the assertion made by the respondent. This 
						conclusion may be illustrated by reference to the Court 
						of Appeal decision in ARMAH VS: ADDOQUAYE (1972) 1GLR 
						109. The brief facts of that case as provided in the 
						head notes are that &quot;The plaintiff claimed a declaration 
						of title to land and other consequential reliefs in the 
						High Court. Judgment was given for the defendant on the 
						ground that the plaintiff had failed to discharge the 
						burden of proof upon him. The plaintiff appealed to the 
						Court of Appeal and during the hearing counsel drew the 
						court's attention to the fact that that part of the 
						statement of claim (para.(2)) which recited his root of 
						title had not been traversed either specifically or 
						generally in the statement of defence. He submitted that 
						by virtue of Order 19 rules 14 and 18 of LN 140A/54 the 
						averments contained in paragraph (2) must be deemed to 
						have been admitted by the defendant and consequently 
						there was no need for the plaintiff to adduce any 
						evidence in the support of his title to the land. The 
						court held that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(1) Order 19 rule 14, 
						18 and 20 have one common object, namely, to compel each 
						party in his turn to admit fully or deny fully each 
						allegation of fact in the pleading of his opponent. 
						Under Order 32 rule 6 any party at any stage may move 
						for such Judgment on admissions of fact made, either on 
						pleadings or otherwise, as upon such admissions he may 
						be entitled to, without waiting for the determination of 
						any other question between the parties.......&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The action, BILLA vrs: 
						SALIFU (1971) 2 GLR 87, more directly addresses the 
						point on hand. In that action, an adultress admitted 
						sleeping with the named adulterer, however, this piece 
						of evidence was not challenged in cross-examination. The 
						trial High Court, Tamale held that&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(1) plaintiffs' 
						evidence could only have meant that she was confessing 
						to having had sexual intercourse with the appellant. The 
						failure of the appellant to challenge this evidence was 
						in effect an admission of the allegation&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instant action 
						therefore where the respondent pleaded and further led 
						oral evidence to prove the basis of his claim of 
						ownership of the land in dispute, and the appellant 
						failed to challenge him in cross-examination and 
						furthermore failed to lead his own independent evidence 
						of how his own family acquired the land in question, the 
						respondent was deemed in law to have proved his title to 
						the land to justify a declaration made in his favour. In 
						spite of the appellants counterclaim for a declaration 
						of title to the disputed land, he failed absolutely to 
						lead an iota or scintilla of evidence on that issue to 
						make way for the court to decide the matter on a balance 
						of probabilities as provided under section 12 (1) of the 
						Evidence Decree 1975 (NRCD 323).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After the trial 
						therefore the trial court made two clear findings of 
						fact to wit (1) that the land in dispute is different 
						from the Asempare land and that the land in dispute was 
						Pledged to Okomfo Kofi Duro the defendant/appellant's 
						predecessor for an amount of £4.13/- and has since been 
						unredeemed: (ii) a pledge at customary law is 
						perpetually redeemable, and upon these, he gave judgment 
						in favour of the plaintiff/respondent, thereby 
						dismissing the counterclaim on the ground that it was 
						unproved. It was against this decision of the trial 
						judge that this appeal was filed contending that the 
						judgment is against the weight of evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The evidence, apart 
						from establishing that the respondent's family owned the 
						disputed land also established the appellant's family's 
						possession of same. While the appellant could not show 
						how the property came into the possession of his family, 
						the respondent, supported by his witnesses were united 
						in proffering the evidence that one Oheneba Kwasi Adjei, 
						who was a husband of Kenyase Ohemaa Yaa Kanku, fell into 
						debt and pledged the family land aforesaid to a 
						predecessor of the appellant by name Nana Kofi Duro for 
						the sum of £4.13/-. This issue of evidence was accepted 
						by the trial judge as most probable. As a matter of 
						emphasis where the parties before the court respectively 
						claim adverse title to the same property and where one 
						party, supported by witnesses, led evidence of ownership 
						while his opponent was only able to show his possession 
						of the land but failed to show how he came to possess 
						it, then the appellate court would be loath to disturb 
						the finding by the trial court in favour of the party 
						who apart from establishing his ownership, also led 
						evidence to show how the property went into the 
						possession of his opponent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Upon the evidence 
						available to us therefore, I find no reason to disturb 
						the trial court's finding that Nana Kwasi Adjei, the 
						respondent's predecessor was the one who pledge the 
						disputed property to the appellant's predecessor Nana 
						Kofi Duro for the sum of £4.13/-. That finding is not 
						contrary to the evidence on record.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The next issue raised 
						in this appeal relates to the period of the pledge and 
						the failure of the plaintiff's family to remind the 
						appellant's family from time to time of the existence of 
						the pledge. It was contended by, or on behalf of the 
						appellant that Nana Kwaku Dua II, the Asantehene during 
						whose reign according to the respondent, the purported 
						pledge was made, reigned from 1883 to 1888, so that the 
						said pledge took place at least 110 years before the 
						plaintiff made any attempt to redeem it. It was 
						contended furthermore by the appellant that neither in 
						the respondent's statement of claim nor in his evidence 
						in court did he assert that his family ever told the 
						successor of the late Nana Kofi Duro or any member of 
						the said Kofi Duro's family, about the alleged pledge of 
						the land in dispute to the appellant's family. The 
						appellant next referred to another incident of pledge of 
						land between the two families, this time however, from 
						the appellant's family to the respondent's. This took 
						place in 1925. This pledge was redeemed by the 
						appellant's family in 1949 when the sum involved, £12/- 
						was paid to the respondent personally, against a receipt 
						issued by the latter in evidence of the said redemption. 
						The appellant consequently submitted that if the 
						respondent's story was true that their family had made 
						an earlier pledge to the appellant's family, then common 
						sense would require of the respondent to, at least, make 
						reference to the pendency of the earlier pledge that 
						however was not the case. No reference whatsoever was 
						made to the alleged pledge in 1925 when the second 
						pledge was made nor in 1949 when it was redeemed. Two 
						issues were raised upon this complaint. In the first 
						place, it was contended that the pledge, if it existed 
						had lasted for too long, more than one hundred years. 
						Secondly, that the respondent is estopped from asserting 
						or redeeming the pledge. I will agree with the appellant 
						that the failure by the respondent and his family to 
						honour the customary law rule of reminding the family of 
						the pledgee or his successors in succession at funerals 
						or other occasions, social or otherwise, had the effect 
						of giving the pledgee family a false sense of ownership 
						of the subject matter in their own right. The legal 
						position on this issue of keeping the validity of the 
						pledge alive and the added issue of estoppel, however, 
						does not support the appellant. It seems that so far, 
						all the decided authorities to date as well as text 
						writers agree on this one fact that a customary pledge 
						is perpetually redeemable. The case of KUMA &amp; ANOR. VS: 
						KOFI &amp; ORS. (1956) 1 WALR 128 seems to contain all the 
						major ingredients of a customary pledge. In that case 
						the plaintiffs brought an action in a Native Court for 
						an order for the redemption of land alleged by them to 
						have been pledged to the defendant some years back. The 
						defendant resisted the claim contending that the land 
						was sold to them not pledged. The trial court's decision 
						in favour of the plaintiffs was over turned by the 
						Native Appeal Court. A further appeal at the instance of 
						the plaintiffs was upheld by the land Court, Accra where 
						it was held that </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(1) that the judgment 
						of the Native Trial Court in favour of the plaintiffs 
						was based on findings of fact and that the native Appeal 
						Court was not justified in reversing that decision.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) By Native Law and 
						custom a pledge can be redeemed at any time, and lapse 
						of time is no bar...&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The above principle of 
						native law and custom that lapse of time is no bar to 
						custom that the right of a pledgor to redeem his pledged 
						property was stated in an earlier case titled AGBO KOFI 
						vrs. ADDO KOFI (1933) 1 WACA 284. It is a principle 
						which answers the concern of the appellant herein that 
						the alleged pledge to Nana Kofi Duro by the respondent's 
						predecessor Nana Kwasi Agyei over one hundred years ago, 
						cannot be affected by the effluxion of time. The 
						principle that long duration does not compromise the 
						nature or redeemability of a pledge was applied in 
						ADOBEA &amp; ORS. vs; Lassey (1956) 1 WACA 181 where it was 
						held inter alia that, by native custom a pledgor or his 
						successor may redeem a pledge at any time.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">See also DZANKU VS: 
						KWADWO (1960) GLR 31 CA. In that case it was held that</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(1) lapse of time 
						cannot change the nature of a transaction from pledge to 
						sale.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) no matter how long 
						property may have remained a pledge, the successors of 
						the original owners may exercise their right to redeem 
						it whenever they decide to do so...&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The other aspect of the 
						contention raised by the appellant was in respect of his 
						perceived estoppel on the part of the respondent. His 
						complaint was that the plaintiff was very much involved 
						in the redemption of defendant's family pledge to 
						plaintiff's family involving the payment of £12 to 
						plaintiff himself, but never mentioned his family's 
						indebtedness of £4.13/- to defendant's family. He added 
						that if a pledge did exist the plaintiff would have 
						raised it in 1949 when defendant went and redeemed the 
						pledge. The issue here was an expression of doubt which 
						should negatively affect the respondent's claim. It is 
						my candid view that whatever doubt that was raised by 
						the failure of the respondent's family to keep on 
						reminding the appellants of the pledge was erazed by the 
						failure of the appellant to prove his family ownership 
						of the disputed property in the face of the overwhelming 
						evidence in favour of the respondent on that matter. 
						This makes respondent's evidence on how the appellant's 
						gained possession of the land more probable. Legally 
						however, failure by the pledgor to remind the pledgee 
						from time to time of the continuing pledge would not 
						operate to render the pledge invalid. See KUMA &amp; ANOR. 
						Vs: KOFI &amp; ors. (supra) where it was further held that;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(3) The performance by 
						the original pledgor and his successors of the custom of 
						keeping alive the pledge by introducing themselves to 
						the pledgee's successors must be held to amount to 
						evidence of the continued validity of the pledge, but 
						failure to perform that custom cannot be allowed to 
						invalidate the existence of a pledge, if its existence 
						can be proved by some other evidence&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Further to the numerous 
						decided cases, text writers too maintain the principle 
						of the pledgor's right of redemption irrespective of how 
						long the pledge transaction had been in force. On this 
						point Gordon Woodman at page 150 of his book Customary 
						Land Law in the Ghanaians Courts stated that &quot;In 
						customary law the mere passage of time does not cause 
						right to lapse.&quot; Although the learned author hinted that 
						this rule had been modified by the doctrine of estoppel 
						by acquiescence, he was equally quick to admit that &quot;in 
						the case of pledges, however, there is considerable 
						authority for the view that not even that doctrine 
						applies, and that the pledgor may redeem after any 
						period of time, and despite any intervening events 
						whatsoever&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is by now certain 
						that the existence of a pledge as alleged by the 
						respondent cannot be faulted by the failure of his 
						family to perform the custom of reminding the pledgee 
						family of its existence at any time the chance presented 
						itself. The fact that the respondent's owned the land 
						which is now in the possession of the appellant's 
						family, and failure by the latter to demonstrate to the 
						court how his family gained possession thereof, answers 
						the requirement, as stated in the KUMA V KOFI case 
						(supra) of proof by some other evidence. Even though it 
						appears that the respondent was not prudent enough to 
						set off his credit against the appellant when the latter 
						went to redeem their pledge in 1949 that fact alone is 
						not strong enough basis to disturb the findings of the 
						trial court. I will accordingly dismiss the appeal.</span></p>

						by Appellant, Counsel.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It will be useful to 
						recall the brief facts of the contention between the two 
						sides before proceeding further. The parcel of land 
						which is in dispute between the two parties is in the 
						possession of the defendants who are claiming ownership 
						thereof plaintiff on the other hand claiming the same 
						land on the basis that the land has, been his family's 
						property since the time it was acquired by way of gift 
						in marriage by plaintiff's ancestors Nana Adwupa. But 
						the land was at a stage in their history pledged to a 
						member of defendants' family and that is how the 
						defendants' family came to be in possession. The 
						defendant denies the plaintiff's story and in response 
						explains that it is rather his family who pledge their 
						land to the plaintiffs' family but that pledge has been 
						redeemed through the plaintiff himself and that the 
						redemption money being ($12sic) twelve pounds was paid 
						to the plaintiffs who issued a receipt therefor. It is 
						the contention of counsel for appellant that if there 
						was any such pledge between the parties, plaintiff's or 
						he himself would have mentioned it at least at the time 
						when defendant's family were redeeming their pledged 
						land from plaintiff's family. At the close of the 
						pleadings, issues set down for determination on evidence 
						were as follows;&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) Whether or not the 
						land the subject matter of this dispute was a gift to a 
						predecessor of the plaintiff by one Barima A. Kofi.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) Whether or not the 
						land the subject matter of this suit was pledged to one 
						Kofi Duro a predecessor of the defendant for the sum of 
						£4:13/-.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) Whether or not the 
						plaintiff was entited to the relief's plaintiff seeks.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Although the defendant 
						did not make, the plea of estoppel one of the issues for 
						trial he pleaded it in his amended statement of Defence 
						and Counterclaim which (I agree requires attention) as 
						being an issue raised by the pleadings.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After evaluating the 
						evidence adduced from both sides, the trial Judge made 
						the following finding of fact:-</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Now from the evidence 
						adduced by the plaintiff and the defendant I find as a 
						fact that the land in dispute is different from the 
						Asempare land and that the land in dispute was pledged 
						to Okomfo Kofi Duro, Defendants' predecessor for an 
						amount of £4:13/- and has since been unredeemed&quot;. 
						Considering the traditional evidence on record : as to 
						the plaintiffs method of acquisition the identity of the 
						land together with adjoining owners' testimony 
						confirming the pledge to the defendant's family, the 
						trial Judges finding are hereby affirmed. See ODOI vs: 
						HAMMOND (I 971) LALA 375, and also EBO v. ABABIO (1957) 
						2 WALA 55 pc.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As regard the issue of 
						estoppel based on the conduct of the plaintiff: his 
						failure to mention to the defendant's family the 
						existence of the pledge now in dispute between the two 
						families (especially in 1949) when the defendants family 
						were redeeming their land from the plaintiffs' family, 
						the trial Judge had this to say: &quot;With respect to 
						learned Counsel for the defendant, this argument has no 
						altractionsic in customary law. A notorious feature of 
						the customary pledge is that it is perpetually 
						redeemable, regardless of effluxion of time. The 
						principle is that once a pledge always a pledge.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Yes, I agree with the 
						trial judge that that is the principle and accordingly 
						affirm it but it appears to me that Counsel for 
						plaintiff is contending more than that. He says: 
						&quot;Neither in his statement of claim nor in his evidence 
						in court did plaintiff assert that his family ever told 
						the successor of late Nana Kofi Duro or any member of 
						the said Kofi Duro's family i.e. the defendants family 
						about the purported pledge of the land in dispute to 
						defendants family&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">By this contention, 
						Appellants Counsel is implying indirectly that there was 
						no such pledge at all. And even if there was such a 
						pledge, plaintiffs' family neglected (or omitted) to 
						keep it alive as required by customary law. (See 
						paragraph 113-114) of Ollennu's &quot;Principles of customary 
						land law in Ghana&quot; where the learned Authors says:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Now by customary law 
						where a man dies, before burial, while his body lies in 
						state, or as soon as possible after the burial, his 
						creditors and debtors should introduce themselves to the 
						family, and declare what amount is owed them, or what 
						amount they owe to the deceased and creditors who are 
						pledgees should disclose that fact. Where a successor is 
						appointed, the family should in turn introduce him to 
						the said creditors and debtors. The performance of these 
						customs is among the incidents of a pledge. Very often, 
						however people neglect to observe the custom. But such 
						neglect (or omission) to perform the custom does not 
						alter the transaction, vesting ownership of the property 
						in the pledgee.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned Author 
						continued &quot;In Kuma and Anor. Vs: Kofi &amp; Ors. (1956) 1 
						WALR 128 the plaintiffs sued for the redemption of land 
						pledged by their family to a predecessor of the 
						defendant. The predecessor resisted the claim on the 
						ground that ground that as the pledgor and his successor 
						never performed the custom referred to upon the death of 
						the original pledges and of his successor, the 
						transaction must be deemed to be a sale and not a 
						pledge, it was held that the performance, by the 
						original pledgor and his successor of the custom of 
						keeping alive the pledge by introducing themselves to 
						the pledgee's successors, and vice versa, must be held 
						to amount to evidence of the continued vadilitysic of 
						the pledge but that failure to perform that custom could 
						not be allowed to invalidate the fact of the pledge if 
						its existence could be proved by some other evidence. In 
						the course of his judgment the learned Judge said: &quot;I do 
						not think that the custom referred to is anything more 
						than the usual attempt of systems of law that had no 
						writing to endeavour to lay down methods of proof by 
						means of a large number of oral witnesses. I do not 
						think that it can be regarded as affecting the 
						confirming validity of a pledge&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I belive the case of 
						Kuma vs: Kofi (supra) fully takes care of the arguments 
						mounted by counsel for plaintiff. It is expected that a 
						pledge would be kept alive by successors of pledgees and 
						pledgors but non-performance or non-observance of that 
						custom does not and cannot invalidate the pledge.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Very significantly 
						pledge is defined in customary law as the delivery of 
						possession and custody of property real or personal by a 
						person to his creditor to hold and use until a debt due 
						is paid, and article borrowed is returned or replaced, 
						or an obligation is discharged. (See Ollennu page 101).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Based on the findings
