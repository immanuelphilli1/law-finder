						<span style="font-family: Arial">JUDGMENT</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">GBADEGBE, JA.:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">By his action, herein 
						commenced before the Circuit Court, Accra the Plaintiff 
						(appellant herein) claimed against the Defendant 
						(respondent herein) the payment of the sum of ¢7.4 
						million being the value of wins drawn on Lotto numbers 
						on 21. 10. 95. The evidence on the record is that the 
						respondent is engaged in the conduct of private lotto 
						under the provision of PNDCL 223 and as such is licensed 
						to operate a lotto other than that undertaken by the 
						Department of National Lotteries.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It appears from the 
						transcript that the controversy herein arose when the 
						respondent claiming that the appellant had not paid for 
						the stakes before the numbers were drawn refused to pay 
						the proceeds of the wins. In his evidence, the appellant 
						contended that he staked the numbers which were drawn 
						out of several to the tune of ¢482,000.00. That he did 
						not pay immediately, he having come to an arrangement 
						with the agent of the respondent, Pw1, the latter who 
						was to pay immediately for the stakes in order that he 
						refunded the same later. In his evidence he stated that 
						the following day i.e. 22. 10. 95, a day after the draw, 
						he turned up in the house of the said agent Pw1, to pay 
						the value. When however, he presented his wining tickets 
						in the expectation of receiving his proceeds the 
						respondent would not pay on the ground that he had 
						credited the stakes. Since the matter could not be 
						resolved, the respondent took out the writ of summons 
						herein claiming as herein before mentioned.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In his evidence the 
						respondent called the agent, Pw1 who is described in the 
						judgment of the lower court as a 'writer' whose evidence 
						was to the effect that the respondent did in fact ask 
						him to pay on his behalf which he did and that on the 
						following day, he come to make a refund of the amount to 
						him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellant 
						strenuously contended at the trial that the stakes of 
						the respondent were credited and that when Pw1's returns 
						of sales were checked he had a deficit of ¢518,000.00 of 
						which the wining tickets in contention were part. At the 
						end of a full scale trial, the learned trial judge found 
						as a fact that the respondent, had made the requisite 
						payment. In his words, contained in the delivery at page 
						48, he expressed himself thus:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;I will prefer the 
						evidence of the plaintiff and Pw1, (the writer) that 
						plaintiff's tickets was paid for on his behalf by the 
						writer before the draw.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Consequently, I will 
						find that the plaintiff had a valid ticket which he won 
						on 21st October 1995. These valid tickets on the 
						evidence before the court entitled the plaintiff to the 
						amount of ¢7,440,000.00 I will therefore give judgment 
						to the plaintiff against the Defendant in the sum of 
						¢7,440,000.00. I will award plaintiff interest on the 
						said sum from 21st October 1995, to the date of the 
						judgment&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Following this, the 
						appellant appealed to this court. As at 14.3.97, the 
						sole ground filed with the notice of appeal was the 
						omnibus one which sought to impeach the court's finding 
						on the ground that it was against the weight of the 
						evidence. Subsequently the said ground was supplemented 
						with the following:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(i) that the trial 
						judge erred in failing to find as a fact that the 
						plaintiff credited the lotto:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(ii) that the trial 
						judge's finding that the writer paid on behalf of the 
						plaintiff is not supported by the evidence</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(iii) that honourable 
						trial judge erred when he failed to find that there was 
						a shortage in the daily order registered on 21st October 
						1995 by the writer.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Before proceeding to 
						consider the appeal in terms of the issue which we are 
						to determine, I think it proper in the exercise of the 
						powers conferred on us under rule 31(b) of CI 19 to 
						correct the defect in the original ground of appeal by 
						substitution for the word 'ruling', judgment. I think 
						that the proceedings before us were based on a judgment, 
						the delivery of the learned trial judge having been made 
						after a full scale trial.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Having regard to the 
						fact that subject matter of the contract before us is 
						one of betting, I think that the same is illegal except 
						it is proved to have been specifically authorised or 
						sanctioned by law. Thus, it is important first for this 
						court to examine the legality or otherwise of the 
						transaction even though no objection was taken to the 
						same by either party see (1) North Western Salt Co Ltd 
						v. Electrolytic Alkali Co Ltd [1914] AC 461 (2) Royal 
						Exchange Assurance v. Sjafarskings Verga [1920] 2 KB - 
						384.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Now, the respondent's 
						own evidence is that he staked the numbers on a 
						'national banker to banker' which was in respect of a 
						lotto to be drawn on 21.10.95. True, it is that the 
						nature of the lotto was not specifically pleaded but I 
						do not think that this precludes this court from 
						examining the relevant legislations namely Act 94, and 
						PNDCL 223 to discern if the transaction is within the 
						limits of the law, and therefore enforceable. It must be 
						pointed out that the undertaking which the Department of 
						National Lotteries is enabled to conduct is different 
						from that of District Weekly Lotto operators and that in 
						particular, the latter group of licence is intended for 
						an undertaking conducted separately and distinctly from 
						the former. In section 1 (b) of Act 94 as amended it is 
						provided:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The operation of any 
						form of lotto other than lotto operated by the 
						Department of National Lotteries shall be known as a 
						District Weekly Lotto&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The parent Act, Act 94 
						also creates the offence of clandestine lotto in the 
						following words in section 3 (1).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;A clandestine lotto, 
						by whatever name called and in whatever manner and under 
						whatever denomination it may be conducted is prohibited&quot; 
						with section (2) going further to create an offence in 
						relation to stakes or undertakings which are clandestine 
						in nature, the said offence being defined in PNDCL 223 
						to mean &quot;...... lotto conducted otherwise than under the 
						provisions of this Act.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my view, it is clear 
						from the enabling legislation that to be enforceable the 
						transaction must be one which is sanctioned by law and 
						that the burden is on the one who requires the court's 
						aid in enforcing the same. On the nature of lotto in 
						terms of the applicable law, See (1) The AG v. Ramble 
						Enterprises Ltd. Unreported ruling of the High Court 
						Accra dated 16. 12.97</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Coram: Gbadegbe J (as 
						he then was).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The simple question 
						which this court has to resolve turning on the nature of 
						the transaction is whether the transaction was within 
						the law? I wish to pause and say that this crucial 
						determination was inadvertently lost sight of by the 
						trial court and since this court in the exercise of its 
						powers of a re-hearing must ensure that judgments of 
						lower court are in conformity with the laws of the land, 
						it is important that this issue be considered.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">See (1) Asare v. 
						Brobbey [1971] 2 GLR 331.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have examined the 
						evidence and come to the view that the contract before 
						us was one which violated the enabling law; in 
						particular it was by its nature a &quot;clandestine lotto 
						within the meaning of sections 3 of Act 94, as defined 
						in PNDCL 223. It being so, it is a transaction which 
						should be struck down as void and one from which neither 
						party derived any specifically enforceable rights. I 
						have taken the said view of the facts firstly by 
						resorting the judicial notice as provided under section 
						9 of the Evidence Decree in view of the usage of the 
						words &quot;national banker to banker&quot; a word which means 
						that the stakes were drawn on the operations of the 
						Department of National Lotteries which is normally done 
						on Saturdays as distinct from the licences, which the 
						appellant obtained to conduct a District Weekly Lotto. I 
						wish to state that judicial notice is often taken by 
						courts of facts which are notorious within the 
						jurisdiction, they being of common knowledge among 
						reasonable men. In the Mc Cormick on Evidence, the 
						learned authors in the 2nd Edition @ para 329 provides 
						thus: &quot;The oldest and plainest ground for judicial 
						notice is that the fact is so commonly known in the 
						community as to make it unprofitable to require proof 
						and so certainly known as to make it indisputable among 
						reasonable men. &quot;The basis of this is said to be rooted 
						in common sense as was said in Harper v. Killiun, 345, 
						S.w.2.d 309, 311 (&quot;Tex. Civ. 1961) thus: &quot;The doctrine 
						of judicial notice is one of common sense. The theory is 
						that, where a fact is well known by all reasonably 
						intelligent people in the community, or its existence is 
						so easily determinable with certainty from unimpeachable 
						sources, it would not be good sense to require formal 
						proof&quot;. I think this explains why section 9 of the 
						Evidence Decree enables the court to take judicial 
						notice of issues at any stage of the proceedings even 
						without an invitation from the parties.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I need also say from 
						common knowledge that the 21st of October 1995 was as 
						said from the evidence and confirmed by calendars a 
						Saturday and that as the evidence disclosed, the draw 
						being on a Saturday at 5pm, it must have been a draw 
						conducted by the Department of National Lotteries under 
						Act 94 which is normally done live on GTV and watched by 
						all who sit by their television at the time. Clearly 
						form the evidence without resort to any surrounding 
						circumstances, the draw was one which the respondent is 
						prohibited from staking and the appellant also 
						prohibited from conducting; thus it is illegal with the 
						result that nothing of consequence flows from it at 
						least in a court of law. see (1) Schandorf v. Zeini 
						[1976] 2 GLR 418 @ 430.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">My Lords, assuming that 
						the point on which this delivery has so far turned which 
						was raised by the court itself is one which is in error, 
						there is also the ground of appeal which raises the 
						question whether or not by crediting the stakes and 
						paying for the same a day after the draws were 
						announced, the respondent had actually made a stake 
						within the contemplation of the contract? In my 
						thinking, a stake cannot be done on credit with the 
						payment being effected after the draw. I think that this 
						is clear from the nature of the game of lotto and the 
						ordinary meaning of the word 'stake' which is money, etc 
						risked or gambled on the unknown result of a future 
						event&quot; see Oxford Learners Dictionary, 4th Edition page 
						1247. In my view, the 'future event' in this context was 
						the draw, therefore for one to have validly made a 
						stake, the payment should have been made before the draw 
						is made. Where as in this case, the respondent relies on 
						credit which he paid on the day following the draw, I 
						think that he had not provided effective consideration 
						for the numbers on which he had gambled and that he 
						cannot rely on the evidence of the writer, the lotto 
						agent. Pw1, that he would make the payment in order that 
						he refunds the same later. I have patiently and 
						carefully considered the evidence of Pw1 and I think 
						that it was one which was offered collusively and out of 
						self-interest; the truth of the matter being that the 
						respondent to this appeal made the payment after the 
						draw and that before then he had not done that which at 
						law would have amounted to a stake. I note that this 
						version of the facts which I have accepted differs from 
						the finding of the trial judge that the stake was paid 
						for by Pw1 on behalf of the respondent, but in my view 
						having regard to the evidence of a shortage in the 
						returns of Pw1 and the evidence of a prompt challenge to 
						the tickets belonging to the respondent on the ground 
						that they were not paid for as well as that of Pw3 on 
						the non-payment in the absence of evidence from the&nbsp; 
						said Pw1 tending to indicate how else the shortage came 
						about the reasonable inference to be drawn from the 
						circumstances is that the tickets credited by the 
						respondent were part of the shortage of ¢518,000.00, his 
						being ¢482,000.00. It is important to observe that since 
						receipt for such stakes are not issued as in ordinary 
						business but the value of the amount paid is entered on 
						the ticket this court must take a view of the 
						transaction which is protective not only of the staker 
						but the undertaker as well and in my opinion the view&nbsp; 
						of the facts accepted by the trial court was clearly 
						unreasonable in that it does not seek to reinforce the 
						fundamental nature of games of chance particularly 
						lotto, and it being so I think that this provides this 
						Court with a legitimate ground for intervention by 
						setting aside the said unreasonable and or wrong finding 
						and substituting in its place a finding that the stakes 
						were not paid for by the respondent before the draw. To 
						hold otherwise in my view would be defeatist of what 
						games of chance are and open the door to others&nbsp; to 
						assert that they had staked on credit. I think that this 
						is a view which the courts should not countenance for if 
						the question were asked: would such persons have paid if 
						they lost, I think the obvious answer is no. 
						Alternatively, I also think that in a similar manner the 
						undertakers or the operators cannot enforce the payment 
						for the stakes against them if they lost.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The result clearly is 
						that the respondent, cannot be enabled to rely on 
						payment made after the draw to enforce the transaction. 
						I think such a payment if accepted was too late in the 
						day and cannot operate retrospectively to regularise the 
						credited stakes and consequently the transaction is one 
						which ought not to be enforce. The result is that the 
						additional grounds (i) and (ii) of the instant appeal, 
						succeed, and the judgment of the lower court is set 
						aside and in place thereof this court enters a judgment 
						dismissing the respondent's case. The appeal is 
						therefore allowed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Since the parties have 
						done that which constitutes an offence as herein before 
						mentioned under Act 94 and PNDCL 223, I believe that the 
						justice of the matter would require that they bear their 
						own costs. The costs allowed by the lower court are also 
						set aside and if paid should be refunded forthwith.</span></p>

						<span style="font-family: Arial">JUSTICE OF APPEAL</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">OWUSU-ANSAH, JA:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff is a 
						lotto customer of a sub-agent of the Defendant Lotto 
						operator.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the 21/10/95 which 
						happened to be a Saturday the plaintiff staked sports 
						lotto from the Defendant Lotto Writer.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It appears that the 
						plaintiff, at the time of staking the lotto, had no 
						money to pay for the ticket and so he entered into a 
						private deal with the lotto writer, who promised to pay 
						on his behalf.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The writer then issued 
						out the ticket to the plaintiff without receiving 
						payment for the ticket.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">When the lotto was 
						drawn later that Saturday evening, at 5.00 p.m. two of 
						the plaintiff's numbers (5-82) were drawn, whereupon the 
						plaintiff proceeded to claim his winnings. The five 
						numbers staked as a matter of interest were 
						31-82-5-41-34. Out of which 82-5 dropped. It is 
						contended that when the amount collected by the Pw1 (the 
						writer) was being paid to the Agent it was short by 
						¢518,000.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Defendant refused 
						to pay the plaintiff as a result of which the plaintiff 
						sued the Defendant Company claiming per his writ as 
						amended. He claimed:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) An Order or 
						specific performance against the Defendant to pay 
						plaintiff cash value of ¢7,440,000 being the total 
						amount of winnings he made on the lotto draw of the 21st 
						of October 1995.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) An order of the 
						Court for the recovery of an amount of ¢7,440,000 being 
						the total amount of lotto won from the Defendant Co.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) Interest on the 
						said amount at the current Bank Rate from the 21/10/95 
						the date of judgment - not the date of&nbsp; payment (it is 
						noted!). At the close of pleadings the following issues 
						were set out for trial:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1) Whether or not the 
						plaintiff staked the following numbers: 31-82-5-41 and 
						34 from the Defendant lotto company.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) Whether or not out 
						of the numbers staked plaintiff won by the following 
						numbers 82-5</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(3) Whether or not the 
						tickets won were valid by the Rules of the game.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(4) Whether or not the 
						plaintiff is known to the Defendant as somebody who won 
						the Defendant's lotto on the 21-10-95.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After hearing the 
						evidence the Court held that the tickets issued out to 
						the Plaintiff, though credited, were paid for on behalf 
						of the plaintiff by the writer. The Court therefore gave 
						judgment for the plaintiff and allowed his claim as 
						endorsed on his writ of summons, and awarded interest on 
						the said amount from the 21/10/95 until the date of 
						final payment. Costs assessed as ¢250,000. Thus making a 
						total of ¢12,712,000.00 altogether.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Defendant Company 
						now appeals against the said judgment. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The main grounds of 
						appeal are as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) &quot;That the trial 
						judge erred in law in failing to find as a fact that the 
						plaintiff credited the Defendant/Appellant lotto.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) That the trial 
						judge's findings that the writer paid on behalf of the 
						plaintiff is not supported by the evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) That the Hon. Trial 
						Judge erred when he failed to find that there was a 
						shortage in the daily sales registered on the 21/10/95 
						by the writer.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d) That the Ruling is 
						against the weight of evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(e) Additional grounds 
						to be filed on receipt of either the judgment or the 
						record of proceedings&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Appellant indicated 
						in his written submission filed on the 26/10/99 that he 
						intended to limit himself to the first two grounds only.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">With respect to ground 
						one, it was submitted on behalf of the Appellant that 
						&quot;instead of the Court determining the issue of payment 
						as the tickets changed hands, to ascertain whether there 
						was any consideration for the tickets staked by the 
						plaintiff, the trial judge was concerned with whether or 
						not the money was paid at all.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The emphasis was thus 
						misplaced according to the Appellant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In regard to the second 
						ground, it was submitted on behalf of the appellant that 
						the evidence of the plaintiff was that &quot;he went to the 
						writer's house to pay for the ticket on Sunday morning 
						which was a day after the draw of the lotto numbers&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In response to ground 
						one, the Respondent submits that the evidence of Pw1 was 
						clear and unambiguous and proves that he paid for the 
						tickets before the draw and the announcement of the 
						result. He quotes extensively from the judgment and 
						concludes that the issue as to whether the plaintiff had 
						paid for his ticket through Pw1 before the draw, was 
						settled when Dw1 gave evidence for the Defendant, adding 
						that Dw1 cannot be believed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In relation to ground 2 
						it was submitted that the appellant had not been able to 
						demonstrate in his statement the error complained of 
						against the trial judge, and further that there had not 
						been any sufficiently convincing evidence that there was 
						a shortage directly attributable to or linked with, the 
						booklets from which the plaintiff did obtain his 
						tickets. It was also said that the plaintiff credited 
						the lotto in contravention of the rules of the Defendant 
						Company. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is clear that the 
						basic issues of fact forming the main grounds of appeal 
						were never raised at the Application for Directions 
						stage as envisaged by the Rules of Court. It appears 
						that the Court did not advert its mind to them at all. 
						Indeed, there would appear to be an abdication of 
						responsibility for proper Directions, hence the apparent 
						confusion as to what were the real issues before the 
						Court and the inability to separate the chaff from the 
						seed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In any event, by not 
						clearly focussing on, or giving undivided attention to 
						the issues in the case the trial court disabled itself 
						from an objective assessment of the evidence. The 
						purported findings of fact in favour of the plaintiff 
						can hardly be supported by the evidence as a whole.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is idle to stress 
						the Rule that it is not the function of an Appellate 
						court to disturb a finding of fact.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">To this Rule, however, 
						there are exceptions including but not limited to:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1. The Rule as stated 
						in the case of Blunt v. Blunt 1943 AC. 517 at 578.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2. Where the so-called 
						findings of fact are not supported by the evidence on 
						record.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3. The trial judge's 
						unjustified omission to consider the evidence as a whole 
						or at all. [Nkrumah v. Atta (1972) 2 GLR 13.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">4. Where the rejection 
						of jurisdiction of the trial court disabled the judge 
						from evaluating the evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At page 12 of the 
						Record the plaintiff states inter alia&quot; I had some 
						numbers, but I had no money. The writer offered to pay 
						on my behalf. He has a taxi. I told him I would pay him 
						back when I make sales. Later I paid to him. The writer 
						agreed to stake for me. He gave me the tickets...&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is significant to 
						note that the date or day of payment was omitted from 
						his evidence in chief.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">However, he only said: 
						&quot;Later I paid him&quot; the cross-examination makes 
						interesting reading:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q. 21st October 1995, 
						which day was it?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A. Saturday.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q. what time did the 
						writer approach you</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A. I did not look at my 
						time, but it will be around 12'0 clock to 1 p.m.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q. When did you pay the 
						money to the writer</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A. Sunday morning.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Cross-examination 
						continued the next day when the plaintiff was asked:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;You know the National 
						Banker to Banker the sellers close at 5.0' clock on 
						Saturday&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A. Yes.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q. And you will agree 
						that at the time you paid for the coupon (on Sunday) the 
						draw had already come out (on Saturday)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A. Yes.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Quite obviously, they 
						were referring to the National Lotto. I think in any 
						case that the court can take judicial notice that at the 
						present moment, it is only the National Lotto that is 
						drawn at 5 p.m. on Saturday.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">When it was suggested 
						to him that the writer never paid any thing on his 
						behalf, he said: &quot;he paid,&quot; although he was not present 
						when the money was allegedly paid by the writer; he was 
						informed later according to him. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Needless to say, this 
						was a bare assertion, a bone without any flesh.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the light of the 
						evidence from the horse's&nbsp; own mouth quoted above in 
						extenso, it is difficult to see how the trial court 
						could conclude that</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The plaintiff and his 
						witness Pw1 maintain that the tickets were paid for 
						before the draw and that the payment was made by the 
						writer for the Plaintiff&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Added to this is the 
						evidence of Pw2. He said&quot;...because the plaintiff 
						credited the Lotto there was a shortage; which shortage 
						indicates that the Plaintiff did not pay for his 
						tickets, neither did Pw1 pay on his behalf&quot;. The fact 
						that this shortage occurred has not been denied. And 
						there is no evidence that any other tickets were unpaid 
						for. It is thus fair to infer on the balance of 
						probabilities that the plaintiff and/or the Pw1 did not 
						pay for the ticket but credited them in contravention of 
						the Rule.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff's case as 
						a whole provides a fertile matrix of contradictions. It 
						is as surprising as it is unsupportable for the court to 
						&quot;prefer the evidence of the plaintiff and Pw1 the writer 
						that the plaintiffs tickets were paid for on his behalf 
						by the writer before the draw. &quot;I find myself 
						regretfully unable to find any evidence to that effect.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff himself 
						never offered any evidence of payment beyond his bare 
						assertion that he paid the money to Pw1 on the following 
						Sunday after the draw, on the previous Saturday.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There is overwhelming 
						evidence on record to show that Pw1 never paid the money 
						on behalf of the plaintiff either on the Saturday or at 
						all.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Quite apart from the 
						recorded shortage there is the evidence of the Police 
						Officer as well as the evidence of Pw1 that the 
						plaintiff and Pw1 both admitted that the tickets were 
						actually credited, and were never paid for, to the 
						operator.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the circumstances, 
						my view is that there is total failure of consideration 
						and therefore no contract was formed on the basis of the 
						credited tickets.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is trite law that 
						the plaintiff must win by the strength of his own case 
						rather than by the weakness of the Defence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">These principles would 
						apply whether or not Pw1 is regarded, or regarded 
						himself, as Agent for the plaintiff or for the Defendant 
						in accepting to pay for the tickets. It would appear 
						that there was a conflict of interest, he really could 
						not play a dual role! Pw2 provides further evidence of 
						the apparent non-payment for the relevant tickets.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The witness states: at 
						page 27 of the record paragraph 10: &quot;when I asked Dan 
						about the credit, Dan did not tell me anything&quot;. (Dan is 
						Pw1) Dan also asked the plaintiff why he told Management 
						that he credited the coupon. Management did not pay 
						because the plaintiff credited the coupon.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The evidence of Pw3 the 
						Police Officer who investigated the matters was that the 
						tickets were submitted to the Defendant Company without 
						money. In other words, they were unpaid for.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the light of the 
						totality of the evidence I am unable to share the 
						conclusion of the trial court. It is in fact any body's 
						guess whether the amount of ¢482,000 allegedly credited 
						by the plaintiff would have been paid by him the 
						following Sunday if his two numbers had not dropped the 
						previous Saturday.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It goes without saying 
						that Lotto is a game of chance. And like most games of 
						chance, it is likely to be open to fraud and abuse. The 
						fact that the Tesano Police got&nbsp; involved in this case 
						at least smacks of suspicion of fraud though there was 
						no evidence beyond reasonable doubt in support of fraud. 
						In my judgment under no circumstances should the holder 
						of credited ticket be in a position to sue for winnings 
						in respect of the credited tickets unless there is an 
						unambiguous written agreement to the contrary.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In all cases there must 
						be incontrovertible evidence that payment therefor was 
						made to, or received by an accredited agent on behalf of 
						the Lotto operator before the draw. Crediting a lotto 
						ticket cannot be in the best public interest; indeed, it 
						can be said to be contrary to public policy. In my view, 
						the practice must be discouraged, if in fact it is as 
						prevalent as it seems.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is noted that at the 
						tail end of the evidence of Pw2, counsel stated as 
						follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;I called the witness, 
						having earlier interviewed her and convinced myself that 
						she had full knowledge of the case. Presently her 
						evidence is hostile to us. I am compelled to apply that 
						she be considered a hostile waste&quot;. With respect, not 
						having full knowledge of a case is different from being 
						hostile.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">BY COURT:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Application granted: 
						And this without any indication as to why the witness 
						was hostile when she had not given a shred of evidence 
						detrimental or damaging to the plaintiff's case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Of course, a hostile 
						witness is a witness who proves adverse to the party 
						calling him or her, especially if the evidence in court 
						differs materially from his or her written statement 
						(Page 43 of the Record)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In Lanquaye v. The 
						Republic [1976] 1 GLR 1 it was held that to treat a 
						witness as a hostile witness the Court first has to form 
						an opinion that the witness is adverse to the party 
						calling him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The fact that the 
						witness's evidence is unfavourable to the party calling 
						him does not necessarily make the witness adverse or 
						hostile. With leave of the court, counsel may then 
						cross-examine him or attack his credibility. Presumably 
						the court was exercising its discretion under section 72 
						of the Evidence Decree 1975 (NRCD 323) in which event 
						the condition thereof must have been satisfied.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The effect of treating 
						a witness as a hostile witness is to render his evidence 
						nugatory, i.e. futile or inoperative. Yet the Court 
						appears to have, not considered, but relied heavily on 
						the evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Said the learned 
						Circuit Judge at 43 line 15: &quot;...Before Counsel applied 
						to treat the witness as a hostile witness, even though 
						she had not offered any evidence adverse to that of the 
						plaintiffs case yet her prevarication and hesitation in 
						testifying gave a clear indication that she may embark 
						on a course adverse to the plaintiff's&quot;, with respect 
						that is not the acid test, and I cannot sanction it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He goes on: &quot;The Court, 
						therefore, granted the application. At the end of her 
						evidence through cross-examination by the plaintiff's 
						counsel, what stood out from her evidence was that on 
						the 21st October 1995, there was a win of ¢7.4 m. The 
						plaintiff went to claim the amount but he was refused 
						payment because he told the Defendant that he credited 
						the ticket. Why the plaintiff was not being paid she 
						said because of a shortage of ¢500,000.00 Agyiri made to 
						her...&quot;. With respect this approach leaves a lot to be 
						desired as the learned judge cannot approbate and 
						reprobate.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There is no law which 
						compels a party to a civil action to call all material 
						witnesses especially if he is aware that the interests 
						of such witnesses conflict with his own, and that it is 
						unlikely that they would give evidence favourable to 
						him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In case of doubt, it is 
						well established that the party who asserts must lose as 
						in this case. This was the view of the Court of Appeal 
						in the case of Abakam Efiana Family v. Mbabido Efiana 
						Family [1950] GLR 362 at 364.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Another aspect of the 
						matter to which the court did not advert its mind is the 
						issue of Agency</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Of course the concept 
						of Agency is of vital importance in all areas of 
						commercial activity. Without it dealings would become 
						cumbersome, expensive and impractical.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The central core of 
						agency is the relationship it denotes; labels used by 
						the parties are of only minor importance.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Agency can be created 
						in a variety of ways. The three principal ones are 
						express agreement, implied agreement, and operation of 
						law. I think the courts would generally prefer to look 
						for the intentions of the parties to see if they 
						intended to create an Agency relationship.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is common knowledge 
						that the power that an agent has to bind the principal 
						depends on the agent's authority-whether express, 
						implied or ostensible.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There is no doubt in 
						this case that Pw1 having been appointed a Lotto seller 
						was a sub-agent of the Agent of the Defendant Company. 
						There is evidence on record that as such he had 
						specifically been instructed not to sell tickets on 
						credit. As an Agent he was under a duty not to exceed 
						the authority granted by the principal, i.e. the proper 
						Agent acting on behalf of the lotto operator.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At page 14 of the 
						record of proceedings Pw1 describes himself as a 
						&quot;sub-agent of Asare Original Pay All.&quot; That being the 
						case, it seems to me to be rather odd to say the least, 
						that he Pw1 and the plaintiff should enter into an oral 
						agreement that he Pw1 would use his own money to pay the 
						operator for the credited lotto tickets on behalf of the 
						plaintiff. This potentially could, and in this case 
						actually did, result in a conflict of interest to the 
						extent that he could also be regarded as an &quot;agent&quot; for 
						the Plaintiff - albeit for a limited period only. The 
						practice whereby the money is agreed to be paid by the 
						Agent to himself on behalf of a third party should as 
						already indicated be discouraged. In the words of Pw1 
						himself &quot;He (the plaintiff that is) told me that he had 
						no money. I told him I would pay for him...</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I therefore agreed to 
						stake for him...&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This inevitably could 
						provide an open - ended avenue for fraud. So much for 
						the evidence. There is also the issue of legality.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">These views have been 
						predicated upon the assumption that the transaction 
						could be properly entered into. The defence that a 
						contract is a wager or illegal within the meaning of the 
						law should, as a general rule, be pleaded, and the facts 
						which are relied upon to bring the transaction within 
						the relevant legal provision should also be stated. 
						Sadly that was not so in this case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In all cases, however, 
						the Court in my view, can itself, take notice of any 
						illegality of the contract, on which the plaintiff is 
						suing, if it appears on the face of the contract, or 
						from the evidence brought before it, by either party, 
						and even though the Defendant has not pleaded the 
						illegality as in this case. This is not surprising 
						because I do not think that it would have been in the 
						interest of either party in the long run.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This view is amply 
						supported by a number of respectable authorities 
						including:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Gadge v. Royal Exchange 
						Assurance [1900] 2 QB 214, and the case of Snell v. 
						Unity Finance Co Ltd. [1964] 2 QB 203.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Where the contract is 
						not Ex facie illegal, the question of illegality will 
						depend upon the surrounding circumstances. I have in 
						mind the National Weekly Lotto Act 1961 Act 94 as 
						amended by National Weekly Lotto (Amendment Law 1989 
						PNDCL 223 Section 1 provides: &quot;With a view to raising 
						revenue it shall be lawful for the ministry to conduct a 
						National Weekly Lotto&quot; the Section 2 (1) states:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Any Lotto, otherwise 
						than a lotto promoted and conducted under the provisions 
						of this Act, shall be unlawful&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) Any person who 
						contravenes the provisions of the preceding sub-section 
						commits an offence and shall be liable on summary 
						conviction to a fine not exceeding two hundred pounds or 
						to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to 
						both such fine and imprisonment&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Section 3 (1) provides:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A clandestine lotto, by 
						whatever name called and in whatever manner and under 
						whatever denomination it may be conducted, is 
						prohibited&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Section 3 (2)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Any person undertaking 
						a clandestine lotto or collecting stakes therein, and 
						any person aiding or abetting the same in any way, 
						commits an offence and shall be liable on summary 
						conviction to a fine of not less than fifty pounds and 
						not exceeding two hundred pounds or to imprisonment for 
						a term of not less than six months and not exceeding two 
						years.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Section 3 (3)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Any person laying 
						stakes in a clandestine lotto not being an accessory 
						commits an offence and shall be liable on summary 
						conviction, to a fine of not less than five pounds and 
						not exceeding twenty pounds.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Act itself does not 
						define &quot;LOTTO&quot; But the Oxford Reference Dictionary 
						defines it as a Game by chance by means of which money 
						is raised by selling numbered tickets and giving prizes 
						to the holders of numbers drawn not called at random, 
						the outcome of which is governed by chance.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my opinion, any 
						other lotto based on the results of the National Lotto 
						draws for the time being at 5pm on Saturdays is prima 
						facie illegal as being clandestine under S. 2(1) of the 
						Act unless the operator produces some authority granted 
						by or on behalf of the Minister.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Looked at in its proper 
						perspective, this case would appear to be within the 
						ambit of the provisions of this Act. I do not consider 
						that the categories of contracts that are illegal or 
						contrary to public policy are closed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It seems to me that Act 
						94 has a dual purpose; first, section 1 itself provides 
						&quot;with a view to raising of revenue it shall be lawful 
						for the Minister to conduct a National Weekly Lotto.&quot; 
						The Act can only make sense if it is read as permitting 
						only the Minister to conduct a National Weekly Lotto.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It may not be 
						inappropriate to point out that the Act itself appears 
						to depict a masterpiece of absolute ambiguity in parts.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">And the Minister, for 
						the avoidance of doubt as for clarification, may be 
						called upon to exercise his powers under section 11 of 
						the Act. That is of course Act 94.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Section 11 provides 
						that the Minister may by legislative instrument make 
						Regulations for a bewildering variety of matters such 
						as:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">a. The Administration 
						of the Lotto.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">b. The number of Lotto 
						offices authorised to receive stakes;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">c. The day, the hour, 
						and the method of conducting the Lotto and its 
						periodical drawings as well as the persons who shall be 
						present at a drawing of the Lotto.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">d. The stakes that may 
						be laid on the result of the draw.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">e. The amount of prizes 
						to be distributed and the conditions under which prizes 
						may be paid.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">f. The manner and the 
						conditions in or under which stakes may be accepted;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">g. The issue and sale 
						of tickets.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">To mention just a 
						few!!!</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Secondly the intent of 
						the Act is not only to raise revenue but also to protect 
						the public.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the former case the 
						relevant contract may not itself be necessarily 
						prohibited. In the latter case, however, it may be 
						implicitly prohibited.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The facts of this case 
						certainly suggest that it is what in popular parlance is 
						often referred to as &quot;Banker to Banker&quot; contract which 
						is prohibited, although this point has not been 
						canvassed by either counsel. It was alluded to at page 
						14 of the Record proceedings by plaintiff himself.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I am satisfied that the 
						instant contract falls within the ambit of the Act and 
						that it is prohibited in so far as the operator does not 
						operate his own system but relies on the draw of the 
						National Lotteries to determine his own results without 
						authority or licence -&nbsp; a loss of revenue to the 
						Government.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was Devlin J, (as he 
						then was) who in the fullness of his wisdom pointed out 
						in the case of St. John Shipping Corpn. v. John Rank 
						Ltd. [1957] 1 QB. 267 at 283 - 287 that &quot;distinction 
						which has an important bearing upon the consequences of 
						illegality is that disregard of a statutory prohibition 
						may render the contract either illegal as formed or 
						illegal as performed&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned judge Lord 
						Devlin goes on: &quot;A contract is illegal as formed if its 
						very creation is prohibited. In such a case the contract 
						is void ab initio. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is a complete 
						nullity under which neither party can acquire any 
						rights, whether there is an intention to break the law 
						or not.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A contract is illegal 
						as performed if, though lawful in its formation, it is 
						performed by one of the parties in a manner prohibited 
						by statute.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned judge 
						continued: &quot;When the contract is lawful in its inception 
						but is executed illegally the position of the party 
						responsible for the infraction of the statute is clear. 
						All contractual rights and remedies are witheld from 
						him&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I am inclined to share 
						the conclusion by Lord Devlin that &quot;Commercial life is 
						nowadays hedged in by so many statutory regulations that 
						it would scarcely promote the interests of justice to 
						drive the plaintiff from the seat of judgment merely 
						because he has committed a minor transgression&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my view, however, 
						the illegality of the contract as performed in this case 
						can even be based on public policy. No allowance is made 
						for innocence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Even a contract that is 
						ex facie lawful will be unenforceable by the plaintiff 
						as a rule if his intention is to exploit it for an 
						illegal purpose as appears to be the case here.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In Gordon vs. 
						Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1910] 12 KB 1080, Lord 
						Justice Buckley at page 1098, neatly summarised the 
						consequences where the contract is illegal at its 
						inception.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Said the learned Judge: 
						&quot;The general principle founded on public policy, is that 
						any transaction that is tainted by illegality in which 
						both parties are equally involved is beyond the pale of 
						the law. No person can claim any right or remedy 
						whatsoever under an illegal transaction in which he has 
						participated. &quot;Ex turpi causa non oritur actio&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Court is bound to 
						veto the enforcement of a contract once it knows that it 
						is illegal whether the knowledge comes from the 
						statement of the guilty party or from outside source. 
						This view is supported by scrutton L.J in Re Mahmoud and 
						Ispahani 1921 2 KB 716 at 729.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Obviously no money can 
						pass by virtue of such a contract itself if this arises 
						ex turpis causa and if both parties are in pari delicto.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Ignorance of the law 
						that Banker to Banker is prima facie unlawful is 
						immaterial to the claim in the event of a win, 
						notwithstanding that it has not been pleaded. The court 
						can take judicial notice of the law.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the evidence, the 
						law and in all the circumstances of this case, it is my 
						judgment that this appeal should be allowed, and the 
						judgment of the trial Circuit Court set aside for the 
						reasons given. It will be wrong to let the judgment 
						stand. Costs allowed in lower Court set aside.</span></p>
