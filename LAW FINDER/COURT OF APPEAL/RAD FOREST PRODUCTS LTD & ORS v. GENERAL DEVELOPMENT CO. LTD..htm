						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The High Court in 
						Sekondi granted an order of interim preservation of 
						certain equipment and vehicles in the possession of the 
						defendants. These items are the subject-matter of four 
						consolidated suits. The application was brought under 
						Order 50, r. 5 of the (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954 (L.N. 
						140A). The Court appointed the Registrar of the Court to 
						be the Receiver/Manager thereof. These are the relevant 
						orders made by the court below:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1. &#8220;...........the 
						detention and preservation of the disputed machines, 
						vehicles and equipment now in the custody and possession 
						of the respondents herein.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2. I hereby further 
						appoint the Deputy Registrar of this Court 
						Receiver/Manager to manage the disputed machinery, 
						vehicles and equipment pending the determination of the 
						suits herein.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3. Both the applicants 
						and the respondents may apply to the Receiver/Manager 
						for the use of any of the items the subject matter of 
						this application to be let on hire to them and the hire 
						price to be paid into Court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Receiver/Manager 
						shall be entitled to a fee of 7½% in cash lodgment into 
						court from the hire of the machines, vehicles and 
						equipment.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Order 50, r. 5 of the 
						High Court Rules under which the application was made 
						provides: It shall be lawful for the Court or a Judge, 
						upon the application of any party to a cause or matter, 
						and upon such terms as may be just, to make any order 
						for the detention, preservation, or inspection of any 
						property or thing, being the subject of such cause or 
						matter, or as to which any question may arise therein, 
						and for all or any of the purposes aforesaid, to 
						authorise any persons to enter upon or into the land or 
						building in the possession of any party to such cause or 
						matter, and for all or any of the purposes aforesaid to 
						authorise any sample to be taken, or any observation to 
						be made or experiments to be tried, which may be 
						necessary or expedient for the purpose of obtaining full 
						information or evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">What considerations go 
						into the granting of an application for an order for 
						preservation and/or detention? a). As decided in GARRARD 
						v. EDGE &amp; Sons, (1889) 58 L.J.Ch. 397: 37 W.R. 501. C.A. 
						the order must be made against the person in possession 
						or custody of the property in dispute. See also WILDER 
						v. WILDER (1912). 56 S.J. 571.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">b) The property must be 
						the subject-rnatter of the suit. Thus in SCOTT v. 
						MERCANTILE ACCIDENT INSURANCE CO. (1892) 8 T.L.R. 320, 
						the lower court made an order that certain jewellery 
						should remain in the custody of the police. An appeal 
						against this order was allowed because it was admitted 
						on the evidence that the property was not the subject 
						matter of the action, but that only a question might 
						arise about it in the cause or matter.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">c) It was held in LENEY 
						&amp; SONS, LTD. v. CALLINGHAM &amp; THOMPSON, (1908) 1 K.B. 79 
						at p. 84, per Farwell, L.J. that &#8220;the question of the 
						exercise of the judicial discretion was always based, 
						and is still based, upon this, that there is property in 
						dispute to some interest in which plaintiff shows a 
						prima facie title; and preservation is ensured until the 
						rights of the parties can be finally determined.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">d) The case of CHAPLIN 
						v. BARNETT (1912) 28 T.L.R. 256 decides that the order 
						will be granted so long as there is something which 
						ought to be done to ensure the security of the property.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">e) An order will be 
						made in order to preserve the subject-matter of the suit 
						from destruction; see STRELLEY v. PEARSON (1880). 15 Ch. 
						D. 113, where the court granted an order restraining the 
						defendant from ceasing to pump water out of a mine for 
						the sole purpose of preventing the mine from 
						destruction.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">f) The court will also 
						grant an order in order to preserve the subject-matter 
						from depreciation physically or in value. So if it&#8217;s 
						established that it is necessary to do so the court will 
						grant it, hence an order was made in the case of NEW 
						ORLEANS S.S. CO. v. LONDON etc INSURANCE CO. (1909) 1 
						K.B. 943, that a ship lying in a port in Singapore be 
						brought to England for preservation there.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">However an order may 
						not be made if it&#8217;ll cause undue hardship in carrying it 
						out or will serve no useful purpose. These grounds are 
						by no means exhaustive; other grounds may unfold due to 
						the particular case under consideration.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is the plaintiffs&#8217; 
						case that they gave certain named equipment, vehicles 
						etc, called the items for short, to the defendants on 
						hire basis and that the latter have defaulted in meeting 
						the agreed hiring charges. Besides, the defendants are 
						also misusing the items. The defendants denied these 
						averments claiming a right of ownership over same. The 
						items in question were identified in Suit No. 14/99 in 
						an annexure to the statement of claim. Those in Suit No. 
						15/99 were identified in Annexure 2 attached to the 
						statement of claim. Those in Suit No. 16/99 were also 
						identified in an Annexure to the statement of claim. 
						Those in Suit No. 31/99 were identified in paragraph 
						13(iii) of the statement of claim. All these items are 
						said to be in the possession of the defendants, a fact 
						they do not deny, so under the authority of GERRARD v. 
						EDGE &amp; Sons (supra), an order could be made for their 
						detention and preservation whilst they still remain in 
						the hands of the defendants.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Let me now examine what 
						the trial court said: &#8220;In the circumstances of the facts 
						in this case, I find from the affidavit evidence before 
						the court that the balance of convenience talks in 
						favour of the applicants. The applicants will suffer 
						hardship if the application is refused.&#8221; Thus the 
						court&#8217;s reasons are based on the balance of convenience 
						and hardship principles. The trial court had earlier 
						accepted that ownership of these items was vested in the 
						plaintiffs. So in effect the trial court was saying that 
						if the defendants were allowed to use the items in the 
						manner complained of, it would work hardship against the 
						plaintiffs.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It appears from the 
						pleadings that both parties traded in mutual accusation 
						of mismanagement and improper handling of the items in 
						question which had, at one time or the other, come into 
						the custody and care of either party. So they both 
						genuinely believe, albeit on the pleadings, that 
						wherever they are, the items are not receiving the due 
						care and attention that ought to be attached to them. In 
						such a scenario, an order of preservation would be 
						justified. The plaintiffs have shown they have an 
						interest in these properties. On the pleadings, serious 
						questions, both in law and fact, are raised concerning 
						ownership of these items, which both sides claim to be 
						their own. If at the end of the day the plaintiffs are 
						found to be the true owners thereof, it may be difficult 
						to restore them to the position whereby they&#8217;d reap full 
						benefit from their investment. For these reasons it 
						cannot be argued at this stage that the trial court was 
						wrong. And it would be in the interest of the parties 
						that these items, especially the vehicles which 
						depreciate with time and usage, be preserved whilst the 
						rights of the parties are determined. Again the 
						applicants herein have not succeeded in showing that the 
						order is working any more hardship against them than it 
						does against the respondents. The first order made by 
						the court below will therefore not be disturbed until 
						the appeal has been heard.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I consider next the 
						second and third orders of the court below in relation 
						to this application for stay of execution. The nature of 
						the orders 2 &amp; 3 above confirm that the application 
						before the trial court was also for the appointment of a 
						receiver and manager under Order 50, r. 7 of the High 
						Court Rules, to administer the items in question. Much 
						as I would have liked to refrain from commenting on 
						these orders lest I should be seen to be prejudging the 
						substantive appeal, nonetheless I am compelled to make a 
						comment or two since that is the only way to give a 
						meaningful decision in this application, especially so 
						too as the applicants believe the trial court erred in 
						law so the appeal stands a reasonable chance of success. 
						Ordinarily, in an application of this nature, that is 
						for a stay of execution, the court will not delve into 
						the reasonableness or otherwise of the appeal 
						succeeding, but it'll not decline such an invitation if 
						it is urged upon it as a key ground for the application.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Generally speaking, an 
						application under Order 50, r. 5 is akin to asking for 
						an injunction, but with a difference, the difference 
						being that the purpose of the injunction sought here 
						must be to preserve the integrity of the property in 
						question whilst the suit proceeds. It is not an 
						injunction that must have the effect of managing the 
						property or dealing with it under a receiver and manager 
						situation, that properly belongs to the realm of 
						injunction coupled with the appointment of a receiver 
						and manager under Rule 7 of Order 50. But if the sole 
						purpose of appointing the receiver/manager is to enable 
						the preservation order to be effectively carried out, it 
						could be accepted depending upon the peculiar 
						circumstances of the application. The known decided 
						cases have all made orders for detention, preservation 
						or inspection without more. See cases like STRELLEY v. 
						PEARSON(supra); NEW ORLEANS V. LONDON INSURANCE (supra). 
						See also VELATI &amp; CO. V. BRAHAM &amp; CO. (1887). 46 
						L.J.C.P.415; RIDPATH &amp; RIDPATH v. ZACHNER (1893) 9 T.L.R. 
						538. When it comes to applications for the appointment 
						of receivers/managers, the considerations are different 
						from those applied in applications for order of 
						detention and/or preservation of property. The 
						application before the trial court was also for the 
						appointment of a receiver/manager. So the court&#8217;s order 
						appointing the Receiver/Manager was meant to give effect 
						to the order granting the application for interim 
						preservation. Receivership involves more than mere 
						preservation, hence the need</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">For different 
						considerations to apply. On the face of the papers 
						before us I think the second and third orders are 
						consequential so I do see their relevance to the 
						application before the trial court so they would not be 
						stayed pending the hearing and determination of the 
						appeal. For that is the best way of securing the 
						interests of both parties herein. If at the end of the 
						day the defendants succeed, whatever hiring charges they 
						may have paid under the trial court&#8217;s order will be 
						there for them to collect back; they&#8217;ll have nothing to 
						lose. This is as against the plaintiffs who have 
						everything to lose if the properties are not well 
						managed and at the same time nothing has been derived 
						from their use. For these reasons the application for a 
						stay of execution will be rejected.</span></p>
