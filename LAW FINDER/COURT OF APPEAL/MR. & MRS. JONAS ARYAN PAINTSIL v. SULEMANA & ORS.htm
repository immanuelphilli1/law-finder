												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is an appeal from the 
												ruling of the Circuit Court 
												Accra, made on 18th July, 2001 
												by which the said court refused 
												to set aside a default judgment 
												in this matter against the 1st 
												defendant [appellant herein] on 
												2nd November, 1999.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In order to make for a better 
												understanding of this appeal, I 
												consider it necessary to recount 
												the facts in brief. By their 
												writ of summons filed on 1st 
												April 1999 the plaintiffs [who 
												are presumably man and wife] 
												sued the defendants, numbering 
												seven, with the appellant herein 
												listed as the first defendant. 
												An endorsement of service of the 
												writ together with the statement 
												of claim was made on the back 
												page of the writ on 6th April, 
												1999 to show that of the seven 
												defendants only two, that is to 
												say, the 3rd defendant Kofi Siaw 
												and the 6th defendant Kpakpo 
												Somuah were served on 1st April 
												1999, the very date on which the 
												writ and the statement of claim 
												were filed. The action was for 
												the recovery of possession of 
												Land, perpetual unjunction and 
												general damages for trespass. On 
												14th April 1999 the Plaintiff 
												filed a motion for an order for 
												substituted service to be 
												effected on the 1st and 7th 
												defendants. The plaintiffs 
												averred in the supporting 
												affidavit, inter alia, that all 
												the Defendants had been served 
												with the writ of summons and the 
												statement of claim except the 
												1st and 7th defendant. The trial 
												Circuit Court granted the 
												application on 20th April, 1999. 
												The order which was subsequently 
												drawn up was erroneously dated 
												21st March, 1999. It was to 
												remain in force for twenty-one 
												days. By the success of the said 
												application an order for 
												substituted service, it was 
												understood and indeed expected 
												that the 1st defendant was to be 
												deemed to have been served by 
												[a] the delivery of the said 
												processes to one Mr. Yartey was 
												alleged to be living nearest to 
												the land in dispute and [b] by 
												posting copies of the said 
												processes on the wall of the 
												structure the 1st defendant was 
												erecting on the land in dispute 
												for at least twenty one days. A 
												subsequent search which the 
												plaintiff conducted in the 
												Registry of the Circuit Court, 
												Accra filed on 21st May 1999 but 
												responded to on 9th June, 1999 
												disclosed, inter alia, that the 
												1st defendant was served with 
												the writ of summons and 
												statement of claim on 21st 
												April, 1999. Even though I have 
												decided to limit this judgment 
												as much as possible to the 1st 
												defendant/appellant, I find need 
												to digress briefly to mention 
												that the search under 
												consideration further indicated 
												that the 3rd defendant had 
												entered an appearance, since 
												14th April, 1999. Neither the 
												memorandum and notice of 
												appearance, nor the statement of 
												defence allegedly filed by 3rd 
												defendant, as borne out by the 
												proceedings on 21st May, 2000 
												was included in the record 
												before us. There is however a 
												reply to the 3rd Defendant's 
												statement of defence and counter 
												claim.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Reply was filed on 3rd 
												April, 2000, the very date on 
												which a summons for directions 
												was filed. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The plaintiff, apparently 
												fortified by the result of the 
												search they conducted on 21st 
												May, 1999 filed a motion 
												ex-parte for default judgment 
												under Order 13 rule 8 of the 
												High Court [Civil Procedure] 
												Rules [1954] [LN 140A] against 
												the defaulting defendants. On 
												2nd Novemeber, 1999 the 1st 
												plaintiff Mr Jonas Paintsil gave 
												sworn evidence in open court 
												after which judgment was entered 
												in favour of the plaintiffs 
												granting all the reliefs 
												indorsed on the writ of summons 
												and costs of ¢800,000.00 was 
												awarded against each of the 
												defendants but excluding the 
												3rd, in favour of the 
												plaintiffs. It appears that 
												counsel for the plaintiff's 
												problems with service of court 
												processes on the defendants was 
												revisited yet again when 
												attempts were made to serve the 
												defendants with notice of entry 
												of judgment. Accordingly he 
												filed another motion for an 
												order for substituted service on 
												29th June 2000. It was granted 
												by the court, as prayed, on 6th 
												July, 2000 and was made valid 
												for fourteen days. A search 
												conducted on behalf of the 1st 
												defendant/appellant on 7th 
												August, 2000 showed that the 
												writ of summons, the statement 
												of claim and the notice of entry 
												of judgment were served on the 
												1st defendant/appellant, and a 
												second search by the 1st 
												defendant/appellant on 9th 
												August 2000 indicated the mode 
												of the alleged service to be by 
												&quot;posting on the wall structure 
												of 1st defendant&quot;. There was yet 
												another search, this time, at 
												the instance of the plaintiff, 
												on 10th August, 2000, and this 
												search gave the date of service 
												to be 15th July, 2000. Upon the 
												strength of this information, 
												the plaintiffs sought leave of 
												the trial court for a writ of 
												possession. Leave was 
												accordingly granted on 11th 
												September, 2000 and the 
												plaintiffs acted swiftly by, 
												inter alia, demolishing the 1st 
												defendant&#8217;s building supposedly 
												on the disputed land. When the 
												1st defendant/appellant woke up 
												to what had befallen his 
												building, he entered an 
												appearance to the action on 3rd 
												January, 2001 and on the same 
												day applied to set aside the 
												entry of the default judgment. 
												The 1st defendant/appellant&#8217;s 
												motion was based upon his 
												alleged absolute ignorance about 
												the action filed by the 
												plaintiffs&#8217; and all the 
												processes and proceedings taken 
												therein leading to the 
												demolition of his house. After 
												the plaintiffs had duly filed 
												their affidavit in opposition, a 
												date was fixed to hear the 
												motion. Upon the record, counsel 
												for the appellant made his 
												submissions viva voce to the 
												Court on 16th March, 2001. At 
												the end thereof, the matter was 
												adjourned until 6th April, 2001 
												for counsel for the plaintiffs 
												to reply. On 4th April, 2001 
												counsel for the plaintiffs filed 
												what they titled, supplementary 
												affidavit of the plaintiffs in 
												reply. This step by the 
												plaintiffs was contrary to the 
												procedure then being followed by 
												the Court. The record does not 
												indicate that counsel for the 
												plaintiffs sought leave to 
												dispense with an oral replay to 
												the submissions by his opposing 
												counsel for the appellant, 
												neither is there any record that 
												leave was granted him to file 
												his reply. To say the least the 
												step taken by plaintiffs&#8217; 
												counsel without notice or leave 
												of the court, was bound to cause 
												no little surprise to his 
												opponent. Regrettably the court 
												seemed obvious to the arbitrary 
												decision of plaintiffs&#8217; counsel, 
												and accepted it. This step would 
												deny appellant&#8217;s counsel any 
												comment he might have on 
												plaintiffs&#8217; counsel&#8217;s reply. On 
												18th July, 2001, the court 
												refused to set aside the default 
												judgment that it had entered 
												against the appellant and 
												awarded costs of ¢150,000.00 
												against the appellant. This 
												ruling which is brief, is hereby 
												reproduced.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;RULING: I am unable to accede 
												to the prayer of the 1st 
												defendant/applicant. Accordingly 
												the application filed on 3rd 
												January, 2001 praying to set 
												aside the default Judgment is 
												refused with costs of 
												¢150,000.00&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It was against this refusal that 
												the herein appeal was filed. I 
												will now proceed to the grounds 
												of the appeal and consider the 
												submissions of both counsel.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The first ground of appeal as 
												set down and argued is:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;(1) The learned trial judge did 
												not exercise his discretion 
												judicially in refusing the 
												application to set aside the 
												default judgment.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Arguing this ground of appeal 
												Counsel for the appellant 
												referred to the right offered a 
												plaintiff to apply for the entry 
												of default judgment upon certain 
												conditions, as provided under 
												Order 13 rule 8 of LN 140A. 
												Having stated the right offered, 
												he also called attention to 
												Order 13 rule II which might be 
												called in aid by a defendant 
												against whom default judgment 
												has been entered, to apply to 
												set it aside. Order 13 rule 8 
												provides that:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;8. In case no appearance shall 
												be entered in an action for the 
												recovery of land, within the 
												time limited by the writ for 
												appearance, or if an appearance 
												be entered but the defence be 
												limited to part only, the 
												plaintiff shall be at liberty to 
												enter judgment that the person 
												whose title is asserted in the 
												writ shall recover possession of 
												the land&#8230;&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Ruling 11 thereof says:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;11. Where judgment is entered 
												pursuant to any of the preceding 
												rules of this Order, it shall be 
												lawful for the Court or a Judge 
												to set aside or vary such 
												judgment upon such terms as may 
												be just.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Commenting on the above, counsel 
												for the appellant urged upon 
												this Court that the discretion 
												that Order 13 rule 11 confers 
												upon the Judges is a judicial 
												discretion which ought to 
												exercised judicially. The trial 
												Judge however failed to act 
												judicially. Counsel contended 
												that in the exercise of judicial 
												discretion of this nature, some 
												legal considerations have been 
												said to guide the Court., among 
												which is the requirement that 
												the court ought to state reasons 
												justifying its decision or 
												ruling. He submitted that the 
												trial Judge did not make 
												recourse to any of the known 
												judicial guides in considering 
												the application to set aside 
												default judgment. By failing to 
												assign reasons for the ruling 
												the trial Judge must have either 
												taken irrelevant considerations 
												into account or failed to take 
												relevant considerations into 
												account when he purported to 
												apply Order 13 rule 11, to the 
												facts of the application to set 
												aside default judgment. Such 
												failure, it was submitted 
												constitutes an error of law, a 
												jurisdictional error which can 
												be rectified on appeal. Counsel 
												cited for support, the decision

												In reaction to the above 
												submission of Counsel for the 
												appellant, Counsel for the 
												plaintiffs/respondents expressed 
												the view that the application to 
												set aside the default judgment 
												was woefully belated. He called 
												attention that judgment was 
												entered on 2nd November, 1999 
												for default of appearance after 
												the appellant had been duly 
												served with the writ of summons 
												and the statement of claim on 
												21st April 1999. In spite of 
												this service upon him, the 
												appellant failed to enter 
												appearance. This was followed 
												with the service upon the 
												appellant of the notice of entry 
												of judgment on 15th July, 2002. 
												In addition, other court 
												processes were served upon the 
												appellant by substituted service 
												because he was evading personal 
												service. Eventually he entered 
												appearance on 3rd January, 2001, 
												that is, the space of one year 
												and eight months after the 
												service of the writ of summons 
												and statement of claim. Counsel 
												for the respondent furthermore, 
												took strong exception that 
												appellant did not obtain the 
												leave of the Court before filing 
												his entry of appearance out of 
												time, as required by Order 64 of 
												LN 140A. The appellant was also 
												faulted by counsel for the 
												respondents for failing to 
												exhibit any title deed in 
												respect of the disputed land in 
												his favour. The last issue 
												raised on behalf of the 
												respondents on this ground of 
												appeal was that the respondents 
												had already gone into execution, 
												demolished the buildings which 
												had been illegally built 
												thereon, and have taken a step 
												further by divesting themselves 
												of their rights to the disputed 
												property in favour of real 
												estate developers, who have 
												since developed the land. He 
												referred to BLUNT vrs. BLUNT 
												[1943] AC. 517 at 518, which 
												case was applied in the Ghanaian 
												case of CRENTSIL vrs. CRENTSIL. 
												(1962) 2 GLR. 171 at 175. The 
												holding in the BLUNT case 
												(supra) was to the effect that 
												an appeal against the exercise 
												of the court&#8217;s discretion can 
												only succeed where it is shown 
												that the discretion was 
												exercised on wrong or inadequate 
												materials if it can be shown 
												that the Court acted under a 
												misapprehension of fact, in that 
												it either gave weight to 
												irrelevant or unapproved matters 
												or omitted to take relevant 
												matter into account. At least it 
												appears from the submissions 
												that both Counsel are agreed as 
												to the legal soundness of the 
												decision in the BLUNT case 
												(supra). However, counsel sought 
												to rely upon it upon different 
												interpretation. I am therefore 
												to find out whether the court 
												exercised its discretion 
												judicially. The term judicial 
												discretion has been said to be 
												broad and elastic, and equated 
												with sound judgment of court to 
												be exercised according to rules 
												of law. See PEOPLE VRS. RUSSEL 
												70. Cat Rptr.210, 215, 448 p.2d 
												794. And in STATE vrs. GRANT 10 
												Wash. App. 468, 519 P2d 261, 265 
												it was described to be &quot;a sound 
												judgment which is not exercised&nbsp; 
												arbitrarily, but with regard to 
												what is right and equitable in 
												circumstances and law, and which 
												is directed by the reasoning 
												consistence of the trial judge 
												to a just result.&quot; We should now 
												consider the facts and 
												circumstances that led to the 
												entry of the default judgment. 
												The judgment was largely 
												determined by the incidence of 
												non service of the writ of 
												summons and the statement of 
												claim, on the one side, and the 
												failure of the appellant to 
												respond to the action by 
												entering appearance, and may be, 
												filing his defence. The Court 
												gave judgment upon the semblance 
												of proper legal service of the 
												processes filed in the Court on 
												the appellant. It would seem 
												therefore that provided the 
												appellant was duly served, and 
												yet failed to respond, then he 
												either did not have any or a 
												good defence or that he was just 
												not interested. However, a close 
												examination of the facts would 
												reveal that the trial Court did 
												not consider carefully the 
												processes that were urged before 
												it leading to the entry of 
												Judgment. It would be seen that 
												on two occasions the court made 
												an order for substituted 
												service. The first of the two 
												orders was made on 20th April, 
												1999. By the said order which 
												was to remain extant for twenty 
												one days, the writ of summons 
												and the statement of claim were 
												to be delivered to one Mr. 
												Yartey &#8220;lives nearest to the 
												disputed land &#8220;and also by 
												posting copies on the wall of 
												the structure which the 
												appellant was erecting on the 
												land. The search conducted on 
												9th August, 2000 indicated that 
												the appellant was served with 
												the processes in question on 
												21st April, 1999 by posting them 
												on the wall of the appellant&#8217;s 
												structure. There was no mention 
												of Mr. Yartey. It is not known 
												whether copies of the processes 
												were delivered to him as the 
												court had ordered. The 
												application for default judgment 
												did not show particulars of 
												service. It is a matter of grave 
												conjecture whether Mr. Yartey 
												knew or KNOWS the appellant and 
												whether indeed he passed the 
												processes on to the appellant. 
												The simple way this hazy cloud 
												could have been removed from the 
												eyes of the Court was by having 
												an affidavit sworn to by Mr. 
												Yartey showing positively that 
												he discharged the trust reposed 
												on him by the Court by actually 
												bringing the processes to the 
												knowledge of the appellant. 
												Where there was no such 
												evidence, then a doubt can be 
												said to have arisen as to 
												whether indeed the substituted 
												service actually served its 
												purpose.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellant upon oath denied 
												any knowledge of the pendency of 
												the action as well as all the 
												proceedings thereto: The order 
												for substituted service made on 
												20th April, 1999 was to operate 
												for twenty-one days. It was 
												drawn up on 21st April, 1999 
												even though the Registrar 
												mistakenly put down a date one 
												whole month earlier re: 21st 
												March, 1999. Considering that 
												the writ was filed on 1st April, 
												1999, the error is established. 
												It might seem however that the 
												bailiff who proved service might 
												have acted upon the incorrect 
												premise that the order was made 
												on the date appearing where the 
												Registrar had signed: It is 
												respectfully, submitted that 
												twenty-one days from the 21st 
												April, 1999 even including dies 
												non, would last until 11th May, 
												1999 before it could be validly 
												presumed that the appellant had 
												been served. The facts of this 
												case do not support the 
												representation made to the trial 
												court that the appellant was 
												served by substitution on 21st 
												April, 1999. And considering 
												that in this case there was no 
												personal service, it appears the 
												Court was completely deceived 
												into believing that the 
												appellant was served.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Similarly, the whole 
												misconception attending to the 
												service of the writ and 
												statement of claim was re 
												visited with respect to the 
												service of the entry of judgment 
												which led to the issuance of the 
												writ of possession. The 
												substituted service at that 
												stage was granted on 6th July, 
												2000. It was to remain in force 
												for fourteen days that is up 
												until 20th July, 2000 (including 
												dies non). The search conducted 
												by the respondents on 10th 
												August, 2000 however indicated 
												that the appellant was served 
												with the entry of judgment on 
												15th July, 2000. With greatest 
												respect, the answer given in the 
												search was offensive to the 
												order made by the Court. I would 
												add that the Court could not 
												legally go contrary to its own 
												orders and it was legally bound 
												to reject the result of the 
												search and any affidavit based 
												on the erroneous information, 
												and not to rely upon it to 
												inform any decision it made. I 
												have come to this conclusion 
												because of the clear distinction 
												between personal service and 
												substituted service. Order 9 
												rule 2 of LN 140A makes 
												provision for both methods of 
												service. Order 10 thereof is 
												limited to substituted service. 
												The distinction is that personal 
												service is effected by handing 
												the process over to the party to 
												be served or some one who is in 
												a way related to him. After such 
												personal contact, the bailiff 
												would next prove service 
												indicating the time, place and 
												person on whom the process was 
												served. Time begins to be 
												counted from then. In instances 
												of substituted service, there is 
												invariable no personal contact. 
												The order is made to run for a 
												length of time. Service would 
												not be deemed to have been 
												effected until the time fixed 
												had elapsed. It is only then 
												that party to be served can be 
												presumed or deemed to have been 
												served. It is wrong therefore to 
												say that the appellant herein 
												was served with any of those 
												processes when the time given 
												had not elapsed. To this extent 
												therefore I can conclusively say 
												that the processes, i.e the writ 
												of summons, the statement of 
												claim and the notice of entry of 
												judgment were not served on the 
												appellant, it would be wrong to 
												deny him the remedy of setting 
												aside the default judgment made 
												as it was dictated upon 
												misleading premise. It would not 
												be too for fetched to say that 
												the decision of the trial 
												Circuit Court was likely to be 
												different if the above lapses in 
												the matter had been drawn to its 
												attention and considered in 
												arriningsic at&nbsp; the decision not 
												to set aside the default 
												judgment. Under the 
												circumstances, it would not 
												follow the evidence available to 
												fault the appellant for waiting 
												too long. Besides, the concerns 
												raised by counsel for the 
												respondents with regard to delay 
												and failure to apply for 
												extension of time or leave to 
												file entry of appearance, seem 
												not very attractive. The issues 
												were addressed by the Court of 
												Appeal in QUARMYNE vrs. AFEYESI 
												&amp; ORS. (1984-86) 2 GLR. 430. I 
												intend to reproduce the holding. 
												&#8220;the words of Order 13 rule 11 
												of the High Court (Civil 
												Procedure) Rules, 1954 (LN 140A) 
												governing applications to set 
												aside default judgments were 
												clear and do not require any 
												further interpretation except to 
												say that the rule gave wide 
												discretionary powers to the 
												court to set aside judgments in 
												appropriate cases. In exercising 
												that discretion, it was 
												unnecessary for the court to 
												consider whether or not the 
												applicant before applying to set 
												aside the default judgment had 
												obtained leave to enter late 
												appearance. The trial judge had 
												therefore erred in refusing the 
												application on the grounds that 
												prior to bringing the 
												application, the applicant had 
												not obtained leave to enter late 
												appearance. And since the trial 
												judge had found that the 
												judgment had been regularly 
												obtained-there being sufficient 
												evidence in support thereof, the 
												defendant was only required to 
												produce an affidavit of merit 
												before the discretion could be 
												exercised in his favour, since 
												the defendant&#8217;s affidavit had 
												disclosed facts showing defence 
												on the merits the trial judge 
												should have adopted a more 
												liberal approach in the 
												circumstances of the case and 
												acceded to the defendant&#8217;s 
												request so as to allow the case 
												to be fought on the merits.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I agree entirely with the above 
												holding, and I subscribe to it. 
												In the herein case the second 
												ground of appeal is cognisable 
												in terms of the decision in the 
												QUARMYANE vrs AFENESI case 
												(supra) The defence he disclosed 
												in his affidavit in support of 
												the application to set aside the 
												default judgment rested on the 
												non service on him of the 
												relevant processes in the 
												matter. The response of the 
												Counsel for the respondents has 
												been adequately considered 
												above, and I am satisfied that 
												they do not see a matter of 
												fact, really address the issues 
												arising. I believe further that 
												the third ground of appeal, that 
												the ruling is against the weight 
												of evidence before the trial 
												court has also been dealt with. 
												It is correct exposition of law 
												to say that where a trial judge 
												misapprehended the evidence in 
												the exercise of his discretion 
												that would be sufficient 
												justification for interference 
												by an appellate court. See 
												TRABOULSI &amp; Co., vrs. PATTERSON 
												ZOCHONIS &amp; CO. LTD [1973] 1 GLR. 
												133. In the instant appeal I am 
												satisfied that the trial judge 
												was led into the unfortunate 
												position where he was almost 
												powerless to clearly appreciate 
												the case on its proper merits, 
												but for that fact, he was likely 
												to have come to a different 
												conclusion with regard to the 
												entry of default judgment as 
												well as the application to set 
												that judgment aside. The trial 
												judge&#8217;s failure to state any 
												reasons for arriving at his 
												decision not to set aside the 
												judgment that had been entered 
												against the appellant in default 
												of appearances is most 
												unfortunate as it in effect 
												denies the appellate court to 
												fully appreciate the factors 
												that informed the decision. That 
												failure notwithstanding, at is 
												my view that the lapses referred 
												to above in this judgment ought 
												to weigh heavily in the mind of 
												any judge and give direction for 
												the exercise if his discretion.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I cannot end without turning to 
												the allegation made upon oath by 
												the respondents that they had 
												sold the subject matter to real 
												estate developers who had 
												subsequently developed the whole 
												land. If this was really the 
												situation then it is most 
												unfortunate. At the time that 
												the appellant filed his 
												application to set aside the 
												default judgment, the land had 
												not been sold by the 
												respondents. Neither had the 
												land been sold by them at the 
												time the motion was argued. If 
												the respondents had indeed sold 
												the property, that fact would 
												have reflected in the two 
												affidavits field by them on 17th 
												January and 4th April, 2001 
												respectively. The position then 
												is that if they have divested 
												themselves of the land, then 
												that was most probably done 
												during the pendency of this 
												appeal. In any case the 
												respondents had actual notice of 
												the appellants claim to title to 
												the land and the respondents 
												could not be permitted at law to 
												conduct their affairs in a way 
												calculated to defeat justice.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Upon the above reasoning based 
												upon the facts and the law, I 
												have no misgiving whatsoever to 
												uphold the appeal.</span></p>
