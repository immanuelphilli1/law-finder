												This appeal comes from the Accra 
												Fast Track High Court and it is 
												against the judgment delivered 
												on 17th June 2003 by Julius 
												Ansah, J.A, sitting as an 
												additional judge of the High 
												Court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The plaintiff/respondent 
												(hereinafter referred to simply 
												as plaintiff) issued a writ of 
												summons on 13th of December 2002 
												against the defendant/appellant 
												(hereinafter referred to as the 
												defendant) in the Fast Track 
												High Court Accra, claiming the 
												following:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;(1) Plaintiff claim against the 
												defendant is for payment of 
												$600,000 US dollars or its cedi 
												equivalent being general damages 
												for deliberate prevention of the 
												plaintiff by the defendant from 
												boarding defendant's airline 
												which occasioned defendant's 
												loss of lucrative contract in 
												Brussels.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) Costs.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The facts relied upon by the 
												plaintiff to mount his action 
												are briefly that the plaintiff 
												is a businessman and chief 
												executive officer of Trans 
												Africa (2000) Ltd. Plaintiff 
												resides mostly in London but 
												shuttles between that city and 
												Accra and other parts of the 
												world to attend to his business. 
												The defendant on the other hand 
												is an international airline 
												company with an office in Accra. 
												The plaintiff travelled by a 
												business class ticket from 
												London to Accra aboard the 
												defendant's airline. On 15th 
												July 2002, plaintiff reported at 
												Kotoka International Airport to 
												embark on his return journey to 
												London. At 7:30 pm on that 
												15/7/2002 plaintiff proceeded to 
												the defendant's check in 
												counter, where the defendant's 
												staff, a lady, asked him 
												(plaintiff) to place his luggage 
												on the weighing scale to which 
												he complied. The defendant's 
												staff upon looking at the scale 
												said the plaintiff had excess 
												baggage. The plaintiff said he 
												responded by telling the 
												defendant's staff that she 
												should have first observed his 
												class of ticket before saying he 
												had excess baggage. As a result, 
												the defendant's staff requested 
												for the ticket and after 
												examining it, told the plaintiff 
												that his ticket was not valid. 
												This prompted the plaintiff to 
												point out that he had travelled 
												from London by the same ticket 
												and being an open ticket he was 
												now using the out bound to fly 
												back to London and that he 
												confirmed his flight from 
												defendant's partnership hotel 
												(Golden Tulip). The defendant's 
												staff, apparently infuriated by 
												the plaintiff's explanations 
												responded that the plaintiff 
												should not tell her how to do 
												her job and that the ticket was 
												not valid, thereby triggering 
												some arguments. According to the 
												plaintiff, in the course of the 
												arguments he told the 
												defendant's staff that he had a 
												business meeting the following 
												day the 16th July 2002 and must 
												be allowed to board the aircraft 
												to London and then to proceed to 
												Brussels. To this, the 
												defendant's staff sarcastically 
												responded that even if the 
												plaintiff were going to visit 
												the Queen of England, he would 
												not be allowed to fly with the 
												defendant's aircraft since his 
												air ticket was not valid. The 
												staff also told the plaintiff 
												that even though there were 
												vacant seats on the aircraft 
												they would not allow him to 
												board. Meanwhile other 
												passengers, mainly whites, who 
												came after the plaintiff to the 
												defendant's counter were 
												processed and made to board the 
												aircraft. The plaintiff remained 
												at the defendant's counter till 
												the close of the flight 
												whereupon plaintiff left for the 
												La Palm Beach Hotel where he 
												lodged for the night.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The following day, plaintiff 
												sent the General Manager of his 
												company, PWI, to the defendant's 
												main office to ascertain the 
												validity of his KLM business 
												class ticket to be told that not 
												only was the ticket valid but 
												that plaintiff should proceed to 
												the airport that same 16th July 
												2002 to board the plane with the 
												same ticket. The plaintiff 
												accordingly flew to London but 
												was not able to attend the 
												meeting on 16th July 2002 due to 
												the events of the previous 
												evening. This according to 
												plaintiff resulted in his loss 
												of the contract.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The defendant who is aggrieved 
												by the judgment filed an appeal 
												against the whole judgment on 
												the following grounds namely:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) That the learned trial Judge 
												erred in law by 
												allowing/permitting 
												unauthenticated and uncertified 
												self serving letters and 
												documents of the plaintiff to be 
												admitted in evidence 
												notwithstanding objections by 
												the Defendant's counsel to same 
												or by the court on its own 
												motion as per Section 8 of the 
												Evidence Decree 1975 (NRCD 323)</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) That the learned trial judge 
												erred in law by awarding damages 
												to the plaintiff when pleadings 
												and evidence clearly indicate 
												that the plaintiff could not and 
												did not provide specific and 
												sufficient evidence to establish 
												a legal obligation created by 
												mutual agreement between the 
												plaintiff and the defendant that 
												mandated the defendant to fly 
												the plaintiff to a destination 
												in Brussels to allegedly bid for 
												a contract on or before 16th 
												July 2002.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(c) That the learned trial judge 
												also erred in law by finding 
												that, the defendant was in 
												breach of contract and awarding 
												excessive damage and costs to 
												the plaintiff as, even if, the 
												defendant breached its contract 
												with the plaintiff, said heavy 
												damages cannot reasonably be 
												supposed to have been in the 
												contemplation of both plaintiff 
												and defendant at the time of 
												purchase of defendant's airline 
												ticket by the plaintiff.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(d) That the learned trial judge 
												erred by giving judgment in 
												favour of plaintiff when his 
												pleadings and evidence adduced 
												at the trial clearly indicated 
												that he has completely and 
												totally failed to discharge or 
												meet the burden of producing 
												credible evidence on the issue 
												before the court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(e) That the judgment of the 
												learned trial Judge is against 
												the weight of evidence adduced 
												at the trial.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(f) That further and other 
												grounds of appeal may be filed 
												on receipt of a certified copy 
												of the judgment or ruling.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Arguing the first ground of his 
												appeal, the appellant submitted 
												in the statement of case that 
												certain unauthenticated, 
												uncertified and notarized 
												documents were admitted in 
												evidence despite strenuous 
												objections by counsel. As to 
												what specific documents are 
												referred to, counsel for the 
												appellant has, in the main, not 
												been helpful to the court on the 
												issue. Counsel failed to point 
												to the particular documents that 
												were affected by the trial 
												judge's generous reception into 
												evidence. For instance, the 
												reference in the statement of 
												case to page 27 line 20 is not a 
												reference to a particular 
												document whose reception is 
												being questioned nor is the 
												reference to page 31 paragraph 
												12 a reference to an exhibit 
												that ought not to have been 
												accepted in evidence. I believe 
												that the reference to page 31 
												paragraph 12 ought to be a 
												reference to line 12 since the 
												appeal record is read according 
												to the lines and not paragraphs. 
												Thus said, page 31 line 12, does 
												not help the cause mounted by 
												the appellant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The closest to the point is 
												perhaps appellant's reference to 
												other instances of admissions by 
												the Judge on pages 33 to 35 and 
												44 of the record of appeal. The 
												exhibits covered on those paces 
												are exhibits E, F and perhaps G, 
												the exhibit G being admitted on 
												page 45. The plaintiff tendered 
												exhibits A, B, C, D, E and F, 
												ostensibly in proof of his 
												assertion that his status as a 
												prominent business man was 
												recognized by the Sierra Leone, 
												Ghana and British governments as 
												well as by the West Africa 
												magazine respectively. Exhibit A 
												is a letter-purportedly written 
												by the Inspector General of 
												Police of Sierra Leone. Exhibit 
												B is a photocopy of a letter 
												from a 'Commission for the 
												Consolidation of Peace (Sierra 
												Leone Government)' appointing 
												the plaintiff as its Ambassador 
												at Large. Exhibit C is another 
												letter signed by a Chairman 
												'Sammy Doppelt' on a letterhead 
												of Independent Diamond Valuators 
												to the plaintiff to facilitate 
												an invitation to the President 
												of Ghana and his Minister for 
												Mineral affairs to attend a 
												conference. Exhibit D is an 
												unsigned letter bearing the name 
												'SAMY DOPPELT' Chairman, 
												inviting the President of Ghana 
												to an undated meeting with Al 
												Gore former Vice President in 
												attendance. Exhibit E is a 
												photocopy, albeit faxed copy, of 
												a letter from 10 Downing Street 
												to the plaintiff. Finally 
												Exhibit F is a copy of West 
												Africa magazine issue No 4293. 
												As to whether the reception of 
												any of these exhibits in 
												evidence was proper, the same 
												can only be answered by 
												considering whether their 
												reception complied with the 
												provisions of the Evidence 
												Decree.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Since exhibits A, B, C, D and E 
												purport to be documents or 
												copies thereof of foreign 
												official bodies, their admission 
												must be regulated by section 161 
												of NRCD 323. Consequently the 
												said exhibits being foreign 
												official documents should be 
												accompanied by certifications 
												attesting to the Genuineness of 
												the signatures and the official 
												positions of the persons who 
												executed the writings in order 
												for them to be presumed genuine 
												and authorized. These 
												certifications must be signed 
												and sealed by a diplomatic agent 
												of Ghana or of a Commonwealth 
												Country who is assigned or 
												accredited to that country.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Needless to say that in these 
												days of phenomenal advancement 
												in science and technology, the 
												quest to guard against frauds 
												generally by strict adherence to 
												these rules cannot be over 
												emphasized. For this reason no 
												value could be placed on the 
												contents of Exhibit A, B, C, D 
												and E. Rule 8 of NRCD 323 
												empowers this court to exclude, 
												on its own motion, evidence that 
												would be inadmissible if 
												objected to by a party. Exhibits 
												A, E, C, D and E qualify to be 
												so treated and I hereby exclude 
												them from the record. As for 
												Exhibit F, being a periodical, 
												its reception is governed by 
												rule 156 of the Evidence Decree, 
												which makes for its reception as 
												applied by the trial court. Its 
												reception was therefore proper 
												under the circumstance. Reading 
												through the judgment of 17th 
												June 2003 however, I find 
												nothing to suggest that the 
												trial judge placed any reliance 
												on any of the documents just 
												discussed. The judgment was 
												rather informed by legal 
												evidence only for which I cannot 
												fault the judge. In the premises 
												I find no merit in this ground 
												of appeal and dismiss it.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The next two grounds together 
												attack the trial judge's award 
												of damages and excessive costs 
												in favour of the plaintiff 
												particularly when the pleadings 
												and evidence clearly indicate 
												that the plaintiff could not and 
												did not provide specific and 
												sufficient evidence establishing 
												a legal obligation created by 
												mutual agreement between 
												plaintiff and defendant that 
												mandated defendant to fly 
												plaintiff to Brussels to bid for 
												a contract on or before 16th 
												July 2002. In determining these 
												grounds together under the 
												rubric of the omnibus ground 
												that the judgment is against the 
												weight of evidence let me begin 
												by making an observation as to 
												what I consider to be the 
												essence of these grounds of 
												appeal. The crux as I see it, is 
												whether the plaintiff had proved 
												in accordance with S. 15(2) of 
												the Evidence Decree, (NRCD 323), 
												that the defendant was the cause 
												of his alleged loss of contract 
												in Brussels so as to warrant the 
												award of the damages and costs 
												granted by the court. Section 15 
												(2) of NRCD 323 states that, 
												&quot;Unless and until it is shifted, 
												the party claiming that a person 
												did not exercise a requisite 
												degree of care has the burden on 
												that issue.&quot; The case of Hadley 
												vs. Baxendale (1854) 9 Exch.341 
												@354 blazed-the trail for the 
												award of damages wherein 
												Alderson B stated that, &quot;Were 
												two parties have made a contract 
												which one of them has broken, 
												the damages which the other 
												party ought to receive in 
												respect of such breach of 
												contract should be such as may 
												fairly and reasonably be 
												considered either arising 
												naturally i.e. according to the 
												usual course of things, from 
												such breach of contract itself 
												or such as may reasonably be 
												supposed to have been in the 
												contemplation of both parties, 
												at the time they made the 
												contract, as the probable result 
												of the breach of it &quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The defendant is here, not 
												contesting the trial judge's 
												finding that, 'In short 
												therefore, the defendant 
												deliberately and unjustifiably 
												prevented the plaintiff from 
												undertaking his journey aboard 
												their flight on 15th July 2002.' 
												The defendant's concern as can 
												be discerned from the record is 
												that there was no mutual 
												agreement between him 
												(defendant) and plaintiff, 
												mandating defendant to fly 
												plaintiff to Brussels to bid for 
												a contract on or before 16th 
												July 2002. In other words the 
												defendant is here contending 
												that Brussels was not within the 
												contemplation of either party at 
												the time the two of them entered 
												into the contract of carriage. 
												The ticket exhibit M provides 
												for carriage from 'London to 
												Amsterdam to Accra to Amsterdam 
												to London'. The defendant's 
												query appears justified, as 
												borne out by the sequence of 
												events apparent on the record. 
												The record of appeal for 
												instance shows that it was in 
												the course of heated exchanges 
												between the plaintiff and the 
												defendant's agent that plaintiff 
												mentioned that he had a business 
												meeting the following day the 
												16th July 2002 and must be 
												allowed to board the aircraft. 
												Having made the disclosure for 
												the first time and in the 
												obvious heat of passion, the 
												plaintiff required doing more 
												than merely mounting the witness 
												box to repeat the claim, to 
												warrant a determination in his 
												favour. In this endeavour 
												however, I find nothing 
												beneficial to the cause of the 
												plaintiff in this regard to 
												warrant liability being placed 
												on the defendant for the alleged 
												failed trip to Brussels, a claim 
												I find to be otherwise too 
												remote and unproven.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In arriving at this conclusion, 
												I am mindful that the plaintiff 
												failed to lead evidence to show 
												that he had indeed submitted any 
												bid for a contract in Brussels 
												and when. No bid documents were 
												tendered in evidence for 
												scrutiny by the court. The 
												sudden production of exhibit G 
												at the trial court did not 
												advance the issue for the simple 
												reason that the said document 
												did not comply with s. 161 of 
												NRCD 323 and was therefore 
												wrongly received. Exhibit G is 
												the letter dated July 18, 2002 
												on the letterhead of Independent 
												Diamond Valuators, signed by a 
												chairman and addressed to the 
												plaintiff, informing him of the 
												failed bid. By virtue of section 
												8 of NRCD 323, exhibit G is 
												hereby excluded from the record. 
												Yet another cause for doubt 
												about the Brussels bid, is the 
												total lack of evidence about any 
												effort made to reach or inform 
												the Brussels authorities about 
												the flight difficulties or 
												problems between the 15th July 
												2002 when plaintiff failed to 
												board the aircraft and the 16th 
												July 2002 when the bid was 
												supposed to be open for 
												consideration. Furthermore the 
												plaintiff did not consider it 
												necessary to disembark at 
												Amsterdam and proceed to 
												Brussels, which is shorter 
												instead of continuing to London, 
												with the intention of connecting 
												back to Brussels in mainland 
												Europe. Indeed from the 
												plaintiff's own testimony he did 
												not proceed to Brussels after 
												all. The plaintiff also woefully 
												failed to lead evidence stating 
												what time the meeting was 
												scheduled to take place at which 
												he was expected to be present. 
												All this aside, there is nothing 
												to show that it was indeed the 
												absence of plaintiff per se that 
												was responsible for his failure 
												to win the bid. In any case the 
												plaintiff was obliged to show 
												that the Brussels trip was in 
												the contemplation of the parties 
												when they first entered their 
												contract of transporting the 
												plaintiff on defendant's 
												aircraft. These inconsistencies 
												may individually appear harmless 
												but cumulatively they could 
												succeed in discrediting the 
												claim of the proponent of the 
												evidence. This is so with the 
												plaintiff on his claim about his 
												bid in Brussels. Notwithstanding 
												the failure of liability for the 
												alleged Brussels bid, the 
												plaintiff is nonetheless 
												entitled to damages based upon 
												the trial judge's finding that 
												the defendant deliberately and 
												unjustifiably prevented him 
												(plaintiff) from undertaking his 
												journey aboard their flight on 
												15th July 2002 to London. In 
												awarding damages based upon the 
												findings supra, this court must 
												bear in mind the evidence to the 
												effect that the plaintiff was 
												obliged to take up lodgment at 
												La Palm Beach Hotel that 15th 
												July 2002 and the travail he was 
												put to the next day to verify 
												his ticket. It would appear that 
												with the plaintiff's eyes 
												focused on the $600,000.00 US 
												dollars endorsed on his writ of 
												summons, he failed or did not 
												deem it necessary to throw some 
												light on the expenses he 
												incurred when he was put to this 
												discomfort by the actions of the 
												defendant. In any case, the 
												essence of an award of damages 
												is to give the plaintiff 
												compensation for the damage, 
												loss or injury he has suffered. 
												These comprise two main groups 
												notably pecuniary and 
												non-pecuniary loss. The former 
												is made up of all financial and 
												material loss incurred, such as 
												loss of business profits or 
												expenses of medical treatment. 
												The latter comprises all losses, 
												which do not represent an inroad 
												upon a person's financial or 
												material assets, such as 
												physical pain or injury to 
												feeling. The former being a 
												money loss is capable of being 
												arithmetically calculated in 
												money, even though the 
												calculation must sometimes be a 
												rough one where there are 
												difficulties of proof. The 
												latter is not so calculable. See 
												McGregor on Damages 14th 
												Edition, pane 10, (Sweet and 
												Maxwell). Also the speech of 
												Lord Blackburn in Livingstone 
												vs. Rawyards Coal Co. (1880) 5 
												App. Cas 25, 39, defines the 
												measure of damages as &quot;that sum 
												of money which will put the 
												party who has been injured, or 
												who has suffered, in the same 
												position as he would have been 
												in if he had not sustained the 
												wrong for which he is now 
												getting his compensation or 
												reparation. &#8220;Guided by the 
												authorities cited supra and in 
												the light of the evidence on 
												record, there is no doubt at all 
												that the plaintiff is entitled 
												to damages arising out of 
												damages to his feelings or what 
												is sometimes termed a damaging 
												reflection on the &quot;fair fame&quot; of 
												the plaintiff, but not to the 
												measure awarded by the trial 
												judge which I find excessive and 
												unwarranted. Consequently I 
												hereby set aside the fifty 
												thousand US dollars ($50,000) 
												damages against the defendant. I 
												substitute five thousand dollars 
												($5000) damages for the 
												plaintiff instead.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The next segment of this ground 
												of appeal complains about the 
												award of costs made against the 
												defendant. The defendant's 
												reason is that the award was 
												excessive and based upon 
												erroneous estimates. It is trite 
												to observe that a successful 
												party is usually entitled to 
												costs but this is a matter of 
												discretion for the trial judge 
												who is required to exercise his 
												discretion judicially, that is 
												to say, according to reason and 
												justice and not according to 
												sentiments or sensibility. 
												However a party who is aggrieved 
												by an award of costs may upset 
												it if he can show that the judge 
												wrongly exercised his discretion 
												in the particular case. See 
												Nartey-Tokoli vs Volta Aluminium 
												Co. Ltd (1987-88) 2 GLR 532, 
												Guardian Assurance Co. Ltd vs 
												Khayat Trading Store (1972) 2 
												GLR 48, Boullion Industries vs 
												Dizengoff Gh. Ltd, CA, 
												HI/85/2004 of 30th April 2004 
												(unreported). The trial court 
												awarded costs of ten million 
												cedis in favour of the 
												plaintiff. It is not clear what 
												the basis was for the award of 
												this colossal sum except for 
												what appears to be some measure 
												of trading between counsel which 
												ended in disagreement. The case 
												itself does not appear to be 
												complicated. The trial begun on 
												5th May 2003 and judgment 
												delivered on 17th June 2003. The 
												plaintiff called three witnesses 
												whilst the defendants called 
												one. I find in the circumstances 
												the costs of ten million 
												unjustifiable and it is hereby 
												set aside. I substitute cost of 
												four (4) million cedis for the 
												plaintiff in the court below.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The last point of contention I 
												propose to deal with is that the 
												learned judge erred by giving 
												judgment in favour of plaintiff 
												when his pleadings and evidence 
												adduced at the trial clearly 
												indicated that he has completely 
												and totally failed to discharge 
												or meet the burden of producing 
												credible evidence on the issues 
												before the court. In his 
												statement of case, the defendant 
												has sought to reopen or reargue 
												the point as to whether the 
												defendant's refusal to allow the 
												plaintiff on board its aircraft 
												manifestly and irresistibly and 
												solely resulted in the alleged 
												loss of a lucrative contract in 
												Brussels on 16th July 2002. That 
												point has already been resolved 
												and I do not intend to return to 
												it. Another issue raised in the 
												statement of case is whether or 
												not the refusal to allow or 
												carry plaintiff on board to 
												London on 15/7/2002 was 
												unlawful. On this point I dare 
												point out that the court below 
												had before it the sole account 
												of the plaintiff and his 
												witnesses. The line of 
												cross-examination not only 
												failed to make any punches in 
												the plaintiff's case, it also 
												failed to set out clearly the 
												case for the defence. This 
												aside, the defendant was content 
												at listening to the evidence led 
												by the plaintiff without leading 
												any evidence of its own to 
												counter that led by the 
												plaintiff. The result, rightly 
												to my mind, is that the trial 
												judge found for the plaintiff 
												based upon the evidence before 
												him that the refusal to allow 
												the plaintiff to board did not 
												accord with the defendants own 
												conditions of carriage. The 
												defendant's own conduct by not 
												cross examining the plaintiff on 
												crucial matters of disagreement 
												between them rendered it 
												unnecessary for plaintiff to 
												lead further evidence on those 
												points in accordance with 
												section 119 (a) and (b) of NRCD 
												323 which states that a party 
												who fails to cross examine on 
												the evidence led on an issue is 
												deemed to have admitted that 
												evidence. In Fori v Ayirebi 
												(1966) GLR 627 SC, the Supreme 
												Court in its holding (6) decided 
												that: &quot;When a party had made an 
												averment and that averment was 
												not denied, no issue was joined 
												and no evidence need be led on 
												that averment. Similarly when a 
												party had given evidence of a 
												material fact and was not 
												cross-examined upon, he need not 
												call further evidence of that 
												fact&quot; (Emphasis underlined). For 
												instance there was no attempt to 
												cross examine PW2 on his 
												testimony about the lady 
												(defendant's representative) 
												when she was quoted to have said 
												that she did not care and that 
												as far as she was concerned the 
												plaintiff had an invalid ticket 
												and whether the plaintiff had a 
												meeting with the Queen of 
												England was none of her 
												business. From the above 
												scenario the trial judge was 
												right in finding on the evidence 
												that the defendant deliberately 
												and unjustifiably prevented the 
												plaintiff from boarding the 
												aircraft. Equally disturbing for 
												the cause of the defendant was 
												their failure to call any 
												eyewitnesses to testify on their 
												behalf. They may have had a 
												strategic reason for not calling 
												the lady at the center of the 
												controversy but that strategy 
												could also be their undoing. 
												They equally failed to produce 
												the manifest for the day to show 
												whether the claim of the 
												plaintiff that he had booked his 
												flight was borne out. The trial 
												judge who was left with only the 
												testimony of the plaintiff on 
												the issue came to the right 
												conclusion on the matter and I 
												cannot fault him. There is no 
												merit in this ground of appeal 
												and it fails.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In view of the partial success 
												of this appeal the defendant 
												ought ordinarily to be entitled 
												to some costs but taking the 
												total circumstances of this case

												there should be no order as to 
												costs.</span></p>
