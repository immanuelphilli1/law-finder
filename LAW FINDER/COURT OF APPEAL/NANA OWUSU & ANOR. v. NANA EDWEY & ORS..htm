												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												TWUMASI, J.A.:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellants representing the 
												stool of Gomoa Akyemfo 
												instituted an action before the 
												High Court, Cape Coast against 
												the respondents, the first in 
												his capacity as the chief of a 
												town called Dwema otherwise 
												known as Mumford and the rest 
												being subjects and licencees of 
												the first. The subject matter of 
												the suit was a piece or parcel 
												of land described by the 
												appellants as lying and situate 
												at Gomoa Akyemfo and bounded on 
												its sides as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a)&nbsp; On the south by lands 
												belonging to Mumford and Apam 
												stools</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b)&nbsp; On the north by properties 
												of Agyin of Whidda, Kwame Anonu 
												and Kwabena Amoo of Assin 
												Akwantsin </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(c)&nbsp; On the east by Apam stool 
												land </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(d)&nbsp; On the west by Mumford 
												stool land behind the Atue 
												river.&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The complaint leveled against 
												the respondents was that they 
												had committed acts of trespass 
												upon a portion of the land which 
												belonged to the stool of Gomoa 
												Akyemfo. The appellants 
												therefore claimed for (1) a 
												declaration of title to the land 
												described in the indorsement of 
												their writ of summons and as 
												described above, (2) damages for 
												trespass, (3) recovery of 
												possession and (4)&nbsp; perpetual 
												injunction. The appellants 
												claimed that the land in dispute 
												was acquired by their ancestors 
												who broke the virgin forest and 
												settled upon the land from time 
												immemorial. They pleaded that in 
												1963 the Government of Ghana 
												divided to constitute a portion 
												of the land described in their 
												writ for use as Fuel-wood Forest 
												Reserve.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The respondents asserting that 
												they did not recognize any town 
												as Gomoa Akyemfo and that the 
												place they knew was Dwema 
												Akyemfo claimed that the said 
												Dwema Akyemfo was but a suburb 
												of Mumford and that the people 
												of Mumford were the original 
												settlers of the area being 
												claimed by the appellants. They 
												pleaded in paragraph 4 of their 
												statement of defence that their 
												ancestors granted permission to 
												the people of Gomoa Akyemfo to 
												settle on the land because both 
												peoples belonged to the Nsona 
												clan of the Fanti community of 
												Ghana. The respondents therefore 
												contended that the acts of 
												trespass complained of by 
												appellants were a legitimate 
												exercise of the legal rights of 
												the people of Mumford in the 
												development and expansion of the 
												town of Mumford.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What was happening and which 
												prompted the legal action 
												instituted by Gomoa Akyemfo was 
												that the people of Mumford were 
												putting up buildings and 
												otherwise using the land as 
												owners would do without notice 
												to Gomoa Akyemfo. The appellants 
												relied upon the judgment given 
												in their favour by the 
												Commissioner appointed to settle 
												claims in respect of the 
												Fuelwood Forest Reserve 
												acquisition by the Government. 
												By that enquiry and judgment the 
												Commissioner declared the 
												appellants as owners of the 
												Forest Reserve land and rejected 
												the claim by Mumford stool.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The proceedings of the enquiry 
												was tendered in evidence as Ex 
												C. The judgment of the 
												Commission was affirmed by the 
												Court of Appeal. For their part 
												the respondents pleaded certain 
												judgments but the appellants by 
												paragraph 4 of their reply to 
												the statement of defence denied 
												that they were bound by those 
												judgments.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The position therefore that 
												emerged was that apart from the 
												merits of the case each party 
												relied upon the plea of estopped 
												per rem judicatam. The learned 
												trial judge heard the case on 
												the merits and made findings 
												that even though the judgment of 
												the Fuelwood Forest Reserve was 
												unimpeachable it did not operate 
												as a judgment declaring the 
												appellants as owners of the land 
												claimed by them in their writ of 
												summons because, as he opined, 
												the said judgment must be 
												limited to that area affected by 
												the Government acquisition. 
												Before he delivered his judgment 
												the learned trial judge 
												inspected the land in dispute. 
												By this I am talking of the 
												whole or entire area claimed by 
												the appellants in their writ and 
												which same land the respondents 
												claimed as theirs arguing that 
												the whole of Gomoa Akyemfo was a 
												suburb of Mumford. One material 
												fact pleaded by the appellants 
												in paragraph 2 of their reply 
												which was not challenged but 
												which the learned trial judge 
												glossed over in his judgment was 
												the plea that Gomoa Akyemfo had 
												never been part of Mumford or 
												Dwema because Gomoa Akyemfo 
												formed part of the Adonten 
												Division of the Traditional Area 
												while Mumford belonged to the 
												Nifa Division.&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I wish to say before long that 
												in the proceedings of the 
												Reserve Commissioner&#8217;s enquiry a 
												witness states that Mumford is 
												under Nifa Division while Dwema 
												Akyemfo falls under the Adonten 
												Division. Then the witness 
												stated that as the chief of 
												Mumford he is the sole owner of 
												the proposed forest reserve 
												area. The respondents in their 
												amended statement of defence 
												filed long after being served 
												with the reply to their original 
												statement of defence were in my 
												view expected to take that 
												opportunity at least to aver 
												something about that material 
												fact respecting the two separate 
												divisions of the traditional 
												area but this was never thought 
												of.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellants attacked the 
												judgment on three main grounds:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) that the learned trial judge 
												erred in holding that the 
												appellants&#8217; plea of estoppel per 
												rem judicatam could not dispose 
												of the case in their favour.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2)&nbsp; That the learned trial 
												judge erred by substituting his 
												impressions gathered at the 
												inspection of the land for the 
												evidence tendered by the 
												witnesses in court and by the 
												documents.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3)&nbsp; That the judgment was 
												against the weight of the 
												evidence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Before I deal with the 
												submissions of Counsel for the 
												appellants on the question of 
												estoppel I deem it important to 
												state the amplitude of plea of 
												estoppel. In the case of Ababio 
												v Kanga (1932) I WACA 253 at 254 
												Deame CJ stated:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Estoppel per rem judicatam is 
												the rule that a final decision 
												of a court of competent 
												jurisdiction once pronounced 
												between parties cannot be 
												contradicted by any one of such 
												parties as against any other of 
												such parties in any subsequent 
												litigation between them 
												respecting the same subject 
												matter. The word parties must be 
												taken as including privies, a 
												privy being a person whose title 
												is derived from and who claims 
												through a party.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What concerns us in this appeal 
												is the phrase &#8220;the same subject 
												matter&#8221;. This has been construed 
												not only as identity in the 
												ordinary geometric sense, but 
												also identity in the juridical 
												sense and the latter sense has 
												also been explained to mean that 
												in law part of a thing can be 
												construed as being identical 
												with the whole and when this 
												happens it is said that there is 
												identity in the juridical sense. 
												Two cases would be sufficient to 
												illustrate the point. They are 
												Frempong II versus Effah 
												(1961)GLR 205 and Robertson v 
												Reindorf (1971) 2 GLR 289 and 
												the rule can be found in the 
												second case holding (1) as 
												follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;If in an action in respect of a 
												portion of land title to a wider 
												area covering that portion is 
												put in issue, a judgment given 
												in that action operates as 
												estoppel against a subsequent 
												suit involving a portion of the 
												larger area.&#8221; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Thus in the Robertson case the 
												Court of Appeal held that the 
												decision in the earlier suit on 
												a quarry site was arrived at 
												after the court had pronounced 
												that the larger area in which 
												the quarry was situate belonged 
												to the respondent&#8217;s family and 
												that the estoppel raised by that 
												decision should therefore not be 
												limited to the quarry site only. 
												In the instant case, the 
												question naturally obtrudes 
												whether the learned trial judge 
												was right in limiting the 
												estoppel raised by the 
												appellants to the area acquired 
												by the Government for the 
												proposed Fuel wood Forest 
												Reserve. The position taken by 
												Counsel for the respondents was 
												that in order for the rule in 
												Robertson v Reindorf to apply, 
												there must be proof that the 
												court pronounced judgment on the 
												larger area. Accordingly he 
												submitted that the rule was 
												inapplicable to the instant case 
												where the learned Commissioner 
												who settled ownership of the 
												proposed reserve forest area did 
												not pronounce judgment on the 
												ownership of the wider area that 
												was raised in response to this 
												argument.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel for the appellant 
												submitted that since both 
												parties and their witnesses gave 
												evidence in support of their 
												rival claims to the ownership 
												over the wider area and the 
												Commissioner&#8217;s decision was 
												based on the evidence so 
												adduced, the mere fact that he 
												made no formal declaration or 
												pronouncement on the wider area 
												could not affect the application 
												of res judicata over the said 
												wider area. It seems to me that 
												certain portions of the judgment 
												of the Fuelwood Forest Reserve 
												Commissioner may be relevant and 
												LI refer to them as follows:
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												At page 31 of Exhibit C</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Nana Edwey ix gave evidence on 
												oath but in his evidence he was

												&#8220;It is quite clear from Nana

												hopelessly to prove the root of

												&#8220;As against Nana Edwey&#8217;s claim, 
												Kwa Botwe on the other hand was 
												able to trace the history of the 
												proposed area and gave evidence 
												as to how the proposed area was 
												acquired by his ancestors.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the course of his evidence 
												Kwa Botwe described the 
												boundaries of the land which his 
												ancestors founded and the river 
												Atue was particularly mentioned. 
												He also stated that Gomoa 
												Akyemfo paid no tribute to 
												Mumford because Gomoa Akyemfo 
												were the original owners of 
												their land. It is clear from the 
												pronouncements of the 
												Commissioner that in arriving at 
												his decision, he took into 
												account the history of the 
												acquisition by the people of 
												Gomoa Akyemfo of the area they 
												occupied as a people. In this 
												regard I found myself in entire 
												agreement with the submission of 
												Counsel for the appellant that 
												the evidence led and relied on 
												before the Commissioner by both 
												parties was one entire right to 
												the whole area, part of which 
												was eventually constituted into 
												a reserve. Another submission by 
												Counsel for the appellants which 
												found favour with me was his 
												reference to holding two in the 
												case of Aperade Stool v Achiase 
												Stool (1957) 3 WALR page 204 at 
												page 205 thus:</span></p>

												&#8220;A test to be used in 
												determining whether there is 
												identity of subject matter is 
												whether or not the evidence 
												required to establish the one 
												claim will be the same as that 
												required to establish the other&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the instant case the evidence 
												required to prove ownership of 
												the proposed forest reserve was 
												the same as that required to 
												prove ownership of the wider 
												area and once the appellant&#8217;s 
												predecessors were able to 
												establish that their ancestors 
												broke the virgin forest of the 
												area which was being claimed by 
												the respondents and historical 
												evidence was adduced by the 
												appellants side, while the 
												respondents had no history to 
												offer and thereby lost the case, 
												it did not lie in their mouth 
												several years after 1973 to 
												plead history to establish that 
												their ancestors were the 
												original settlers of the area. 
												They are clearly estopped. In my 
												view where there was clear 
												evidence in a previous trial 
												that an issue as to the 
												ownership of a wider area of 
												land subject matter of the suit 
												arose and the trial court or 
												judge gave judgment in favour of 
												a party upon the evidence led 
												before the court, any such 
												judgment in favour of the said 
												party as owner of the specific 
												area being part of the wider 
												area must be taken as judgment 
												for such party over the whole 
												area about which the litigation 
												arose between the parties 
												notwithstanding the omission by 
												the court to make a formal 
												pronouncement to that effect. 
												Were it not the case, there 
												would never be an end to 
												litigation because the loosing 
												party shall always raise 
												litigation piecemeal over the 
												wider area at his whim and 
												caprice. The law frowns over 
												such practice. Thus in the case 
												of Henderson v Henderson 1843 3 
												Hare 100 &#8211; 121 Wingham VC said 
												at page 224 of Vol 64 Revised 
												Reports and I quote:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The plea of estoppel applies in 
												exceptional cases, not only to 
												points upon which the court was 
												actually required by the parties 
												to form an opinion and pronounce 
												judgment, but to every point 
												which properly belonged to the 
												subject matter of the litigation 
												and which the parties exercising 
												reasonable diligence might have 
												brought forward at the time.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the instant case the 
												respondents could not produce 
												historical evidence before the 
												Commissioner in the previous 
												enquiry. They however pleaded 
												copious history in their amended 
												statement of defence to 
												establish&nbsp; that their ancestors 
												were the first settlers of the 
												area known as Gomoa Akyemfo. 
												This was not permissible yet the 
												learned trial judge went into 
												the case and made positive 
												findings that the ancestors of 
												the respondents first settled in 
												the vicinity, abandoned the 
												place before the ancestors of 
												the appellants came to the 
												place. This was clearly 
												unsupportable having regard to 
												the fact found by the 
												Commissioner that the 
												respondents predecessors 
												hopelessly failed to prove any 
												root of title to any part of the 
												area in dispute. The learned 
												trial judge failed to advert his 
												mind to the case of Appiah v 
												Addai (1962) 1 GLR 345 where the 
												Supreme Court of the First 
												Republic speaking through Chief 
												Justice Sir Arku Korsah (as he 
												then was) directed that it was 
												incumbent upon a court before 
												which a plaintiff in his 
												statement of claim pleads 
												estoppel against the defendant 
												to try the issue of estoppel 
												before the proceeds to the 
												merits in the event of the plea 
												failing.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the instant case the 
												appellants had raised the issue 
												of estoppel in their pleadings 
												and the learned trial judge 
												erred by ignoring it and 
												proceeding to hear the case on 
												the merits. This approach was 
												dangerous as it did not serve 
												the ends of justice because in 
												such situations the party 
												estopped would naturally take 
												advantage to make amends where 
												his predecessors failed. A 
												glaring event that occurred in 
												the trial, for example, was the 
												averment by the respondents in 
												their statement of defence as 
												amended that Gomoa Akyemfo was a 
												suburb of Mumford. This plea was 
												diametrically adverse to the 
												positive finding by the Forest 
												Reserve Commissioner as born out 
												by Exhibit C and D. Again the 
												appellants&#8217; contention that the 
												Atue river formed one of their 
												boundaries came up in the Forest 
												Reserve proceedings but the 
												learned trial judge after 
												hearing fresh evidence rejected 
												it. This was clearly wrong, to 
												say the least with due respect 
												to the learned trial judge.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The respondents relied upon a 
												judgment in a case entitled The 
												Tribunal Per Linguist Kofi 
												Adubah v Ohene Debi, J.B. 
												Simpson per JJ Quaye and the 
												judgment of the High Court dated 
												29th May 1972 and confirmed by 
												the Court of Appeal, Accra, in a 
												judgment dated 3rd July 1973 in 
												the suit Nana Edwey ix. V Nana 
												Nyan IV And Kobina Ogomong. On 
												the evidence it is clear that 
												the dispute in these cases were 
												fought between Apam and Mumford 
												as to their boundary. Gomoa 
												Akyemfo were not parties. In 
												fact Gomoa Akyemfo gave evidence 
												on behalf of Mumford. It was a 
												clear instance of &#8216;res inter 
												alios acta&#8217;. Professor Nokes in 
												his book titled &#8220;Nokes On 
												evidence&#8221; 4th Edition at page 
												226 puts the point in the 
												following words:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Strangers to former proceedings 
												are not normally estoppel by the 
												judgment, which has been 
												variously regarded as hearsay or 
												as irrelevant opinion, or as a 
												thing done between others ( res 
												inter alios acta ). A judgment 
												in such proceedings cannot 
												usually operate as estoppel 
												either for or against a stranger 
												and it is immaterial that one of 
												the parties to the former 
												proceedings is also a party to 
												the late action&#8221;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This opinion can be found in our 
												local case Bedu v Asbi (1972) 2 
												GLR 238 where the High Court 
												held that a witness cannot rely 
												on estoppel in the action 
												neither can the rule be enforced 
												against him unless he joined as 
												a party. In the case relied upon 
												by the respondents, Gomoa 
												Akyemfo sought to join as a 
												party to protect their interest 
												but it was refused entry on the 
												ground that the issue was the 
												boundary between Apam and 
												Mumford. It was therefore wrong 
												to hold that the judgment 
												affected Akyemfo. I now wish to 
												deal with grounds (a) and (e) of 
												the grounds of appeal which I 
												have outlined as grounds (b) and 
												(c) on the issues of the 
												findings of the learned trial 
												judge being against the weight 
												of the evidence and the alleged 
												improprieties in the inspection 
												of the land by the learned trial 
												judge. First of all, it must be 
												noted that the learned judge had 
												before him a surveyor&#8217;s plan 
												which had been prepared to show 
												the land in dispute ie the area 
												trespassed upon and the 
												respective areas claimed by the 
												parties each showing their 
												boundaries. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The plan was tendered in 
												evidence by consent. Thereafter 
												the parties and their witness 
												gave evidence. I should have 
												thought the next stage for the 
												trial judge was to have made his 
												findings on such evidence 
												relating it to the plan and 
												other exhibits. Inspection to 
												the locus becomes necessary only 
												where the evidence raised a 
												material issue which can only be 
												resolved by the colourless 
												evidence at the locus. Thus in a 
												recent case heard by this court, 
												Raphael Afartei Brown v Komigah 
												Quarshigah dated 11th April 
												2002, unreported, the court 
												found nothing wrong with the 
												trial judge going to the locus 
												to resolve the issue of whether 
												there were coconut trees planted 
												on the land by the respondent, a 
												fact denied by the appellant. 
												There was no survey plan. The 
												danger which unwarranted visit 
												to the locus creates is that the 
												trial judge may be influenced by 
												his impressions gathered at the 
												locus. This is what happened in 
												the instant case and I find that 
												the criticisms by Counsel for 
												the appellants was well 
												justified. For instance on 
												behalf of the appellants PW2 
												testified that adadze trees 
												formed the boundary features 
												between Akyemfo and Apam and 
												also about Kroboadze. The 
												learned judge held that PW2&#8217;s 
												evidence was false because on 
												the evidence Akyemfo shared no 
												boundary with Apam to the south 
												and east with your back facing 
												the sea, but this finding is in 
												conflict with Exhibit 5 where a 
												witness of the defendants 
												admitted that Mumford Salt pound 
												(Akyemfo) lies between Apam and 
												Mumford. This means Akyemfo must 
												share boundaries with Apam and 
												Mumford as stated in their writ 
												of summons and proved by PW2. A 
												careful look at the surveyor&#8217;s 
												plan clearly shows that PW2 
												spoke the truth when he 
												testified at the locus in answer 
												to questions put to him by the 
												learned trial judge at the locus 
												in quo (See page 209 line 19-38 
												of the record of appeal. Even 
												the manner in which the learned 
												trial judge put questions to PW2 
												which in my view smacked of 
												cross-examination could 
												embarrass a witness of low 
												courage. The judge&#8217;s remarks on 
												this incident back to the court 
												room confirmed my disapproval of 
												the approach which may 
												nevertheless have been made in 
												good faith. Another finding made 
												by the learned trial judge which 
												conflicted with a fact which had 
												been established by the 
												Commissioner was about a certain 
												rubbish dump which he saw at the 
												inspection. He used some 
												reasoning to discredit the claim 
												by the appellants that Akyemfo 
												had a boundary at Atue but this 
												had been established by the 
												Commissioner of the Fuelwood 
												Forest Reserve. By far the most 
												intriguing and yet fundamental 
												aspect of the whole case 
												revolves around one question 
												which has continued to agitate 
												my mind. The question is if the 
												respondents&#8217; claim that Gomoa or 
												Dwema Akyemfo was a suburb of 
												Mumford which implies that their 
												whole land mass on which they 
												existed as a people was a 
												suburb, and this claim had been 
												found to be false by a 
												Commissioner who enquired into a 
												portion of the land, I see no 
												factual ingenuity by the people 
												of Mumford or legal sophistry by 
												a trial judge to counteract the 
												claim that Akyemfo people owned 
												the land. The area trespassed 
												upon clearly falls within Gomoa 
												Akyemfo.&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The evidence is clear on the map 
												and the testimony of the 
												appellants. The Gomoa Akyemfo on 
												the evidence are a farming 
												community. They control the bush 
												area and the place where the 
												trespass took place and the 
												learned judge erred in not so 
												finding. On the evidence as a 
												whole, I am of the firm view 
												that on the balance of the 
												probabilities the appellants&#8217; 
												case succeeds. The appeal is 
												allowed. The judgment of the 
												court below is hereby set aside. 
												In lieu thereof there shall be
