						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This appeal was brought 
						against the ruling of the High Court, Tema given on 1st 
						August 2000. I have decided to narrate the facts, in a 
						brief form that led to the ruling against which this 
						appeal&nbsp; has been brought.&nbsp; They are as follows: </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On 6th September 1996, 
						the plaintiffs issued out a writ of summons claiming 
						certain declarations, orders and damages against the 
						defendants. Hearing of the suit was in progress when the 
						parties agreed to settle the matter out of court. They 
						were successful and the terms of settlement were duly 
						filed with the court. By those terms, certain 
						obligations were imposed on the parties.&nbsp; That was on 
						25th January 1999, On 29th January 1999, the court 
						accepted the terms as its judgment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Then on 6th June 2000, 
						the court granted an ex parte application by the 
						plaintiffs restraining the defendants from &#8220;excavating 
						the land&#8230;&#8221; over a distance specified in the order. When 
						the ex parte order expired, another application 
						followed, this time on notice to the defendants. The 
						orders sought were to the effect that the plaintiffs had 
						defaulted in complying with the terms of the settlement, 
						and they were to be restrained from excavating a portion 
						of the land. The court granted both orders as prayed 
						for.&nbsp; The fourth defendant felt aggrieved by the ruling 
						of the court and has brought this appeal against it.&nbsp; 
						The grounds proffered were that: -</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; The learned Judge 
						erred in law by assuming jurisdiction and re-opening the 
						consent judgment delivered on 29th January 1999.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp; That the learned 
						Judge erred in making the orders she did in the said 
						Ruling.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(iii) That the learned 
						Judge misdirected herself in law by failing to properly 
						and adequately consider the affidavit of the appellant 
						which led her to hold that the said affidavit had no 
						merits.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(iv)&nbsp; That the ruling 
						was against the weight of evidence&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I shall hereinafter 
						refer to the fourth defendant, who alone apparently 
						decided to launch the present appeal, as the appellant, 
						and the plaintiffs as the respondents. In support of the 
						first ground of appeal, it was submitted that after the 
						court had delivered the consent judgment, it became 
						functus officio and therefore had no jurisdiction to 
						re-open the matter and vary the terms of the judgment, 
						upon a motion by the plaintiffs all alone. In the view 
						of counsel for the appellant, what the court did 
						amounted to setting aside the consent judgment and 
						giving another judgment that the 4th defendant had not 
						consented to. Counsel cited Guardian Assurance Company 
						Limited v. Bridi [1972] 2 GLR 387 and Anima v. Ahyeye 
						[1955] WALR 40 P.C. in support of his contention. The 
						reply by counsel for the respondents was that the judge 
						did not become bereft of her jurisdiction and this was 
						because the terms of the consent judgment imposed some 
						conditions on both parties which the appellant failed to 
						comply with.&nbsp; This entitled the respondents to go back 
						to the court to seek further orders on the matter.&nbsp; The 
						reason in the view of counsel was that the breaches by 
						the appellant amounted to a waiver or an abandonment of 
						the judgment in so far as it was beneficial to him, the 
						appellant. Counsel also found support for this 
						submission in terms of Order 42, rule 2 of the High 
						Court Rules 1954, (L.N. 140A). What was more, the 
						application to the court was not to set aside the 
						consent judgment on grounds of mistake of fact or fraud 
						which would have required the joint consent of both 
						parties to set aside.&nbsp; Rather, when the appellants 
						breached the terms of the consent judgment, and as 
						stated already, were deemed to waived or abandoned their 
						rights under the consent judgment, Order 42r2 of L.N. 
						140A allowed the respondents to go back to the court to 
						seek what order they deemed fit under the circumstances. 
						In this case they thought the court restoring them to 
						the status quo ante was the best option left to them, 
						which they did.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The parties did not 
						dispute the facts of this case. If anything at all, it 
						was on what should be done when a party to a consent 
						judgment fails to comply with the terms of the judgment 
						that counsel differed.&nbsp; This was largely a matter of law 
						that must be stated as follows: a judgment by consent 
						was binding on the parties until set aside. An appeal 
						may lie against it only with the leave of the court. The 
						law was settled that once a consent judgment was passed 
						and entered, such as was done in this case, then the 
						court cannot set it aside unless a fresh action was 
						brought for that purpose. The grounds for setting aside 
						the judgment may be fraud, mistake, or generally, any 
						other ground upon which an agreement may be invalidated. 
						A refusal or failure to discharge an obligation under 
						the consent judgment was one of those grounds known to 
						or recognized by the law. Also, a court has no power to 
						vary a consent order previously made in that court and 
						the only means open to a party to set aside a consent 
						judgment or order on the ground of mistake or fraud is 
						to bring a fresh action for that purpose. In the 
						Guardian Assurance case (supra), it was clear that there 
						was a mistake on the period of time of a temporary 
						disablement. The mistake was common to the parties. In 
						the present case however, there was no such mistake of 
						any sort and to that extent Guardian Assurance must be 
						distinguished from the present. However, in that case, 
						reference was made to a passage in Halsbury&#8217;s Laws of 
						England, (3rd ed.) Vol. 22 where it was stated that:
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;A judgment given or an 
						order may, in a fresh action brought for the purpose, be 
						set aside on any ground which would invalidate a 
						compromise not contained in a judgment or order &#8230; Unless 
						all the parties agree, a consent order, when entered, 
						can only be set aside by a fresh action, and an 
						application cannot be made to the court of first 
						instance in the original action to set aside the 
						judgment or order, except, apparently, in the case of an 
						interlocutory order, nor can it be done by way of 
						appeal&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Certain principles 
						emerge from this statement of the law quoted above. They 
						are that it is only by a fresh action that a consent 
						judgment can be set aside once the court has entered a 
						consent judgment. Again one does not apply to the court 
						of first instance (i.e. the court where the consent 
						judgment was entered), to set aside the consent 
						judgment.&nbsp; Apparently the reason is that the Judge who 
						entered the judgment was thereafter functus officio. It 
						is not by an appeal that a consent judgment can be set 
						aside. But all the parties can agree to set aside the 
						consent judgment by any other method. I have read 
						Guardian Assurance and come to the conclusion that it 
						was decided that way for the reason that there was 
						incontroverted evidence that there was a genuine mistake 
						in stating the period of the temporary disablement. In 
						the present case however, there has not been any such 
						mistake. To that extend then, Guardian Assurance must be 
						distinguished from the facts of this case. I must state 
						however that the authorities cited in that case are very 
						useful in resolving the issues raised in this appeal.&nbsp; 
						The question posed by the first ground of appeal is 
						this.&nbsp; When the trial judge entered the consent 
						judgment, what legal effect did it have on the parties? 
						The answers are many. In the first place as shown above, 
						the judgment was binding on the parties until set aside. 
						But it was in Yardom v. Minta III (1926) F.C. &#8217;26-29&#8217;, 
						76 that the legal effect of a consent judgment was 
						considered. Howes&nbsp; J, said:-</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;This judgment by 
						consent is a contract of record, which contract is 
						technically of the highest nature of all contracts. Even 
						so, regarded in the light of a contract, a judgment does 
						no more than give, to one party, rights of the strongest 
						possible character against the other party&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The parties to this 
						kind of judgment are not only bound by the terms of the 
						judgment, they are required by law to perform their side 
						of the bargain. What happens then when a party refuses, 
						fails or neglects to discharge his obligations under the 
						judgment?&nbsp; In law, the other side is entitled to bring 
						the contract to an end by any of the modes recognized by 
						law. Counsel for the respondents referred to Order 42r2 
						of L.N. 140A and submitted that by virtue of that rule 
						they were entitled to go back to the court to seek 
						remedy the sort of what they did. Order 42r2 says that:-</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;2.&nbsp; Where any person 
						who has obtained any judgment or order upon condition 
						does not perform or comply with such condition, he shall 
						be considered to have waived or abandoned such judgment 
						or order so far as the same is beneficial to himself, 
						and any other person interested in the matter may on 
						breach or non-performance of the condition take either 
						such proceedings as the judgment or order may in such 
						case warrant, or such proceedings might have been taken 
						if no such judgment or order had been made, unless the 
						Court or a Judge shall otherwise direct&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The true meaning of 
						this rule is that where the entitlement to a relief was 
						made subject to the fulfillment of a condition, then 
						until that condition had been fulfilled, the order fell 
						to the ground, and the position was the same as though 
						no order had been made: see Talbot v. Blindell [1908] 
						2K.B. 114. In that case, it was said that where an order 
						granting relief against the forfeiture of a lease was 
						expressed to be made upon the defendants performing 
						certain conditions and the defendants, having performed 
						part of the conditions declined to perform the remainder 
						desired to waive the relief, it was held that there was 
						no power to compel the defendants to perform the 
						conditions and that the order for relief must therefore 
						be treated as abandoned. Upjohn K.C. appearing for the 
						defendants, submitted that the order granted by the 
						court was conditional and the conditions were not 
						mandatory at all and if the defendants declined to 
						perform the conditions, the order for relief fell to the 
						ground. Walton J upheld this submission. In such a 
						situation, any party interested in the matter may take 
						such steps as he may think if and legally permissible 
						under the circumstances. A party to a consent judgment 
						may set it aside on any legal ground.&nbsp; But as seen from 
						the authorities, this can only be done by way of a fresh 
						action brought for that purpose. In other words, it was 
						not open to a party who complains of non-compliance of a 
						condition or, all or some of the conditions in a 
						judgment, to go back to the same court and seek orders 
						of the court to vary the terms of that consent judgment, 
						on an application. It appears from the record that after 
						judgment had been entered on the terms agreed upon by 
						the parties, on 29th January 1999, on 6th June 2000 an 
						ex-parte application was brought for orders to restrain 
						the fourth defendant appellant from entering the land.&nbsp; 
						The application having succeeded, it was as expected 
						repeated on notice, and subsequently granted. I hold 
						that on the authorities, the procedure that the 
						respondents adopted in the circumstances of this case 
						was wrong. The respondents should have rather brought a 
						fresh action to set aside the consent judgment. The 
						application before the court was incompetent in law and 
						the court should have refused it. By granting it, the 
						court erred in law.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the result, this 
						court expresses the opinion that the application before 
						the trial&nbsp; judge to vary the terms of the consent 
						judgment for the reason that the appellant refused to 
						perform the condition(s) upon which it was based was 
						incompetent as the judge was, after entering the consent 
						judgment, functus officio. By law, a fresh action should 
						have been brought to set the consent judgment aside.&nbsp; 
						The appeal is therefore allowed on this ground clear by 
						this conclusion, this is not necessary to course the
