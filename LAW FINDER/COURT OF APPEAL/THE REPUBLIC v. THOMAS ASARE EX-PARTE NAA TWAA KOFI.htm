												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The parties in these proceedings 
												are the parties in a suit 
												pending before the Tema High 
												Court, Civil Division presided 
												over by Mrs. Felicity Amoah J. 
												On the 22nd of January 1999, she 
												found the applicant &#8220;guilty&#8221; of 
												contempt for having disobeyed an 
												interim order made in the course 
												of the pending civil cause. She 
												made the following pronouncement 
												with&nbsp; regard to sentence&#8221;:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;I find the respondent guilty 
												and for his contemptuous act he 
												is sentenced to a fine of ¢3 
												million or in default 3 months 
												imprisonment. ¢2 million of the 
												fine when paid should be given 
												to the applicant as 
												compensation.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The respondent is to pay the 
												fine within 10 days. He is 
												therefore admitted to ball in 
												the sum of ¢3 million with one 
												surety to be justified. I award 
												cost of ¢200,000.00 against 
												respondent.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Within four days of the order, 
												the applicant, in the exercise 
												of his legitimate rights has 
												appealed against the ruling, the 
												finding that he was in contempt 
												of court and the sentence. He 
												quickly followed it up with a 
												motion for stay of execution 
												pending appeal, which 
												unfortunately the trial court 
												found unmeritorious and 
												consequently dismissed. He is 
												therefore, by this present 
												motion applying for that interim 
												relief, which was, denied him by 
												the court below. The main 
												grounds upon which the appeal 
												was filed and on which also this 
												motion was argued before us, in 
												an attempt to demonstrate that 
												theirs is no frivolous appeal, 
												but one with a very high success 
												rate are the following:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;(1) That the ruling was an 
												error in law as the applicant 
												was wrongly found guilty for a 
												criminal contempt when the act 
												complained of was, properly 
												speaking in the nature of a 
												civil contempt.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) The sentence which was 
												imposed was harsh excessive and 
												oppressive, having regard to the 
												circumstances of the case, 
												particularly when the evidence 
												did not show that the respondent 
												suffered any loss as a result of 
												his alleged continuous acts.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												However, what appeared to be a 
												straightforward, simple and 
												innocuous application raised an 
												interesting procedural issue. 
												The argument raised by the other 
												side in opposition to the 
												application as it stood; is 
												this, since the contemptuous act 
												for which he was found &#8220;guilty&#8221; 
												and &#8220;sentenced&#8221; to a fine of or 
												in default a term of 
												imprisonment is in the nature of 
												a quasi criminal offence, having 
												suffered a conviction, the 
												proper course open to the 
												applicant was to appeal to the 
												Criminal Division of the Court 
												of Appeal and follow same up 
												with an application for bail 
												pending appeal, if he were 
												desirous of having the sentence 
												suspended. This argument did not 
												come as a surprise. The 
												respondent had clearly in his 
												affidavit in opposition raised 
												it as the only point of 
												objection to the prayer sought. 
												He deposed as follows by the 
												par.7</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;That I am advised and verily 
												believe same to be true that 
												contempt of court is of quasi 
												criminal offence and having been 
												convicted by the trial court, 
												the only recourse to the 
												applicant is to appeal against 
												the decision and apply for bail 
												pending appeal....&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In response to these arguments, 
												applicant counsel has argued 
												that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) Firstly, since the trial 
												judge never formally convicted 
												the applicant we are not in 
												these proceedings dealing with a 
												quasi criminal matter and in 
												respect of which they ought to 
												follow the procedure laid down 
												in criminal appeals.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) In any case, should we come 
												to the conclusion that she did, 
												she was clearly in error as the 
												acts they are alleged to have 
												committed would not amount to a 
												criminal contempt, at all but a 
												civil contempt in which case she 
												has not fallen into any 
												procedural error.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												But I do not think the solution 
												to the issue raised by 
												respondent counsel lies in the 
												approach advocated by applicant 
												counsel in the second limb of 
												his arguments, that is his 
												response to the respondent 
												counsel's sole submission. I 
												think we should resist any 
												temptation to draw firm 
												conclusions of either law or 
												facts on points, which ought 
												properly to be argued at the 
												appeal hearing. To draw firm the 
												conclusions that he has invited 
												us to, namely, that the trial 
												judge fell into error in wrongly 
												convicting applicant for a pure 
												civil contempt would amount to a 
												determination of and 
												consequently to a prejudgment of 
												the appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Certainly, we cannot at this 
												state pronounce on the soundness 
												or other wise of the judge's 
												decision. A cardinal principle 
												of law is that an appellate 
												court, hearing interlocutory 
												applications during the pendency 
												of a substantive appeal, ought 
												to be extremely careful not to 
												prejudge the appeal. It ought 
												therefore to guard against 
												making definitive findings on 
												questions or issues which 
												properly could be made at the 
												hearing of the substantive 
												appeal and when the court would 
												be in receipt of the full record 
												of appeal. On this point, I 
												would like to refer to the 
												Supreme Court decision in Mensah 
												vs. Ghana Football Association 
												1989-90 1 GLR. 1. The court of 
												appeal on hearing an 
												interlocutory application for 
												stay of execution proceeded to 
												make a definitive pronouncement 
												on the question of the locus of 
												the parties. On the issue of 
												whether or not the court had 
												erred in making that finding the 
												Supreme Court unanimously held 
												that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The statements on the capacity 
												of the parties could properly be 
												made by the court of appeal at 
												the conclusion of the hearing in 
												proceedings where the court had 
												the record of appeal before it 
												and not when it was dealing with 
												an interlocutory matter such as 
												stay of execution&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												His Lordship, Mr. Justice Taylor 
												on his part has this to say</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;A decision on locus standi (by 
												the court of appeal) completely 
												disposes of the case and renders 
												the appeal pending otiose. It 
												therefore becomes necessary for 
												any court dealing with it to be 
												extremely careful not to 
												prejudge the appeal without 
												having all the facts in the 
												record of appeal. An application 
												for stay is not ...... concerned 
												as such with a definitive 
												decision the merits of the 
												case&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It follows that the proper stage 
												at which we could pronounce in 
												the manner suggested by 
												applicant counsel, namely that 
												the court fell into error when 
												it found the applicant guilty of 
												a criminal contempt, is at the 
												close of the hearing of the 
												substantive appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												How then do we resolve the issue 
												raised? I am not attracted by 
												the argument that judging from 
												the face of the orders made the 
												court &#8220;convicted&#8221; the applicant 
												for criminal contempt. The court 
												made no such express order, 
												neither did it indicate in some 
												other way that applicant was 
												being held for criminal 
												contempt. I think it safer to 
												presume on the face of the 
												order, that notwithstanding the 
												use of such words as &#8220;guilty&#8221; of 
												the contempt and &#8220;sentence&#8221; the 
												latter in particular merely 
												indicated the punishment that 
												was to go with the contempt. 
												Certainly a civil contempt also 
												is capable of attracting a 
												sentence of a fine. It may well 
												be that when the full record of 
												appeal is before this court, a 
												more definitive and reliable 
												finding on the issue and which 
												is contrary to the above, might 
												be made. But for the moment 
												judging from the record the fact 
												that the court awarded costs of 
												¢200,000 against respondent is 
												also a sufficient point to the 
												fact that the court was 
												exercising a civil, not a 
												criminal jurisdiction. In the 
												result, the argument that an 
												appeal from this order ought to 
												lie to the criminal division 
												does not hold, for the position 
												of the law is that &#8220;failure to 
												obey an order made in civil 
												proceedings is not a crime&#8221;. 
												Consequently, an appeal from the 
												order punishing the contempt is 
												not a &#8220;criminal cause or 
												matter&#8221;. I am persuaded to 
												arrive at this conclusion, by a 
												passage from a learned author&#8217;s 
												exposition of &#8220;Contempt&#8221; in his 
												textbook.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The passage is taken from the 
												very useful, well known and 
												reliable text book &#8220;The Supreme 
												Court Annual Practice 1995 
												Edition Volume 1. Writing under 
												the heading &#8220;Contempt&#8221;, the 
												distinguished author writes.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;It is necessary to distinguish 
												between civil contempt and 
												criminal contempt. Civil 
												Contempt is committed where a 
												person disobeys an order made in 
												civil proceedings. Process for 
												writ contempt is designed to 
												enforce obedience to the order 
												and punish the disobedience.&#8221; 
												Failure to obey an order made in 
												civil proceedings is not a crime 
												and an appeal from the order 
												punishing the civil contempt is 
												not a &#8220;criminal cause or 
												matter&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It follows that:- The applicant 
												was therefore right in appealing 
												to the Civil Division of this 
												court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The next pertinent question is 
												whether or not the proper 
												application ought not to have 
												been for bail pending appeal. I 
												have no doubt that with respect 
												to the costs of ¢200,000.00 the 
												application is proper in all 
												respects. And we would have no 
												difficulty in granting the 
												application for the applicant 
												has demonstrated that he has 
												serious legal issues to raise on 
												appeal. And if the order were 
												not stayed and he succeeded, he 
												would rather suffer irreparable 
												damage. He deposed to this 
												all-important fact by the 
												paragraph 11 of his accompanying 
												affidavit and yet that 
												deposition has not been answered 
												even in a most cursory manner by 
												the respondent. May be, 
												respondent counsel thought the 
												sole ground he raised in 
												opposition was sufficiently 
												strong enough to dislodge the 
												application.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I however, agree with respondent 
												counsel's submissions with 
												regard to the sentence. As 
												rightly argued a stay of 
												execution as understood in civil 
												proceedings is against orders or 
												decrees which can successfully 
												be executed by means of any of 
												the modes provided for under the 
												High Court rules. So for example 
												where a judgement decrees 
												payment of money either by way 
												of damages, debts or cost one 
												may use any of the processes to 
												enforce payment. A victorious 
												party may therefore employ any 
												of the following</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) writ of fieri facias order 
												43 or</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) Garnishee order 45 or</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3) Summons to show cause order 
												69</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												And, where the judgment decrees 
												delivery of property other than 
												land the proper mode would be</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) writ of sequestration order 
												43 or</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) writ of attachment order 44</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3) writ of delivery order 48</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												and so on and so forth.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Clearly, none of the modes 
												provided for can be used to 
												enforce the punishment imposed 
												by the court below and 
												consequently a stay of execution 
												in the strict sense would not be 
												the proper order to make.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												And so, would this court be 
												justified in granting the proper 
												interim order?. I would answer 
												this question in the positive 
												seeing that the substance of the 
												application is to have the order 
												held in abeyance during the 
												pendency of the appeal. That 
												which will justify our 
												intervention in this manner is 
												not only the fact that we have 
												an inherent jurisdiction to do 
												justice to the parties but also 
												the fact that the applicant by 
												his motion prayed additionally 
												for such orders as the 
												honourable court may deem fit on 
												the grounds presented to us per 
												the accompanying affidavit.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What then should be the proper 
												order to make in the 
												circumstance of this case. We 
												think the suspension of all the 
												orders of the court is 
												appropriate. That is to say, we 
												would suspend the enforcement of 
												the others order complained.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												While it is true we cannot point 
												to any specific rule, under CI. 
												19 based primarily on our 
												inherent jurisdiction to do 
												justice to the parties, we could 
												conveniently also raise the rule 
												7 of CI. 19 in our defence, in 
												this entire exercise. The rule 
												stipulates:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Where no provision is expressly 
												made by these rules regarding 
												the practice and procedure which 
												shall apply to any cause or 
												matter before the court, the 
												court shall prescribe such 
												practice and procedure as in the 
												opinion of the court the justice 
												of the cause or matter 
												requires.&#8221;</span></p>
