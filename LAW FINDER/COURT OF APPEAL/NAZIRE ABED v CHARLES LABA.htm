												JUDGMENT</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												H. ABBAN (MRS.)</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is a unanimous decision of 
												the Court. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appeal before the Court 
												arises out of the judgment of 
												his Lordship Apaloo R. K. 
												sitting at the High Court, Accra 
												and delivered on the 10th day of 
												May 2002. The judgment went in 
												favour of the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent 
												(hereinafter referred to simply 
												as the Respondent). The 
												defendant/Appellant who will 
												also be referred to henceforth 
												in this judgment as simply the 
												Appellant, being dissatisfied 
												with the judgment has appealed 
												to this Court against the said 
												judgment.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellant stated five 
												grounds of appeal filed pursuant 
												to leave granted for the appeal 
												to be lodged out of time. 
												Counsel for the Appellant has 
												decided in his wisdom to argue 
												together the 1st and 5th grounds 
												of appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												These are:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;a - The ruling is totally at 
												variance with the totality of 
												evidence adduced at the trial;&quot; 
												and</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;e&nbsp; - The judge made findings of 
												fact that were contradictory and 
												not supported by any evidence on 
												record.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												According to Counsel for the 
												Appellant, the fact that the 
												judge found that the defendant 
												&#8220;assaulted and battered the 
												plaintiff at the Fusion Night 
												Club that evening&#8221; contradicts 
												his other finding that &#8220;at about 
												1.00 a.m. on 22/5/98 there was a 
												scuffle between the parties at 
												the Fusion Night Club.&#8221; Counsel 
												argues that this &#8220;scuffle&#8221; was 
												amply corroborated by PW1 who 
												was present at the club. His 
												line of argument is that if the 
												trial judge is certain that 
												there was a scuffle between the 
												appellant and the Respondent, 
												then the party who was worse off 
												cannot succeed in an action 
												against the other party simply 
												because he was worse off in the 
												scuffle.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												His second ground of appeal is 
												that the learned trial judge 
												erred in granting special 
												damages that had not 
												specifically been endorsed on 
												the writ of summons and had not 
												been proved by the Respondent. 
												Counsel&#8217;s argument is that in 
												the law of tort, there is a 
												distinction between general and 
												special damages and that one of 
												the distinctions is in the area 
												of pleadings. He supported this 
												submission with the Susque Lava 
												case [1926] A.C. 665 where Lord 
												Dunedin stated at page 661 as 
												follows: &#8220;If there be any 
												special damage which is 
												attributable to the wrongful act 
												that special damage must be 
												averred it must be averred that 
												such damage has been suffered 
												but the quantification is a jury 
												question.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Though Counsel argued at length 
												about the award of damages, both 
												general and special, he finally 
												conceded that if the court is 
												inclined to affirm the judgment 
												of the court below and to uphold 
												the damages awarded, the Court 
												must award only nominal damages 
												in the absence of proof of 
												consequential damages suffered 
												by the Respondent.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellant therefore prays 
												this Court to set aside the 
												award made at the Court below 
												and in its stead make a nominal 
												award in favour of the 
												Respondent.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The facts of this case are that 
												on the night of 22nd May 1998 at 
												about 1.00 a.m., the Appellant 
												and the Respondent who were then 
												at the Fusion Night Club, Osu 
												were involved in a scuffle. How 
												did the scuffle start? According 
												to the Respondent, he was seated 
												at a table in the night club 
												with some friends since that 
												date happened to be his 24th 
												birthday and they were 
												celebrating same, when without 
												any provocation from Respondent 
												the Appellant approached their 
												table and asked him to choose a 
												leg to be broken whilst 
												insulting him and his family. 
												Respondent had then returned 
												from France where he had just 
												had a knee surgery from which he 
												was still recovering and he was 
												therefore using crutches. The 
												Appellant then slapped the 
												Respondent and he was about to 
												&#8220;punch&#8221; the operated knee when 
												the Respondent held his 
												(Appellant&#8217;s) wrist.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												From the foregoing account which 
												was amply supported by the PW1 
												(Ali Kwame Maoux) whose 
												evidence-in-chief was to the 
												effect that he saw the Appellant 
												attack the Respondent who was 
												then seated on a bench without 
												any provocation from the latter. 
												This piece of evidence was not 
												discredited under 
												cross-examination nor was any 
												other evidence led through 
												another defence witness to 
												contradict same.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Thus it stands on the records 
												that a battery or &#8220;an unwanted 
												physical contact of his person 
												which constitutes the tort of 
												battery&#8221; took place on the 
												Respondent on the night of the 
												22/5/98.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the case of Cole vrs. Turner 
												{1706} 6 Mod. 149, Holt C.J. 
												stated that the least &#8220;touching 
												of another in anger is a 
												battery;&#8221; and this is still the 
												law. In the law of battery there 
												is no requirement to prove that 
												the contact caused or threatened 
												to cause any physical injury or 
												harm. Thus in the case of Wilson 
												vrs. Pringle [1986] 2 AER 440 at 
												page 495 C.A., it was held that 
												&#8220;an intention to injure is not 
												essential to an action for 
												trespass to the person which is 
												the offence.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Therefore the culpable touching 
												may take several forms subject 
												to the Rule that the contact 
												must be direct.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The principle in awarding 
												damages is to compensate the 
												&#8220;Plaintiff&#8221; for the losses 
												pecuniary and non-pecuniary 
												which he had sustained as a 
												result of the &#8220;Defendant&#8217;s&#8221; tort 
												&#8211; more specifically the 
												assessment process is said to 
												aim at restitutio in integrum.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Here we cite the oft-quoted 
												words of Lord Blackburn that 
												&#8220;the Court should award that sum 
												of money which will put the 
												party who has been injured or 
												who has suffered in the same 
												position as he would have been 
												in if he had not suffered the 
												wrong for which he is now 
												getting his compensation or 
												reparation.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The loss for which the Plaintiff 
												claims compensation must be 
												caused by and must not be too 
												remote a consequence of the 
												defendants tort. Thus in the 
												case before us, the Appellant 
												must reasonably have foreseen 
												that his conduct would aggravate 
												the Respondent&#8217;s injury since he 
												knew or should have known that 
												the Respondent was not 
												physically sound considering 
												that he was using crutches.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In our opinion we think the 
												learned trial judge was right in 
												coming to the conclusion he did 
												in finding that it was the 
												Appellant who &#8220;left his seat, 
												advanced on the Plaintiff, 
												slapped him&#8221; and when the 
												Respondent tried to escape, 
												&#8220;pursued him, punching his feet 
												and leg.&#8221; Again the fact that 
												the Respondent was using 
												crutches and had had an 
												operation on his knee in France 
												was also not disputed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The cases of Rookes vrs. Barnavd 
												{1964} A.C. 1129, 1221 &#8211; 1233 
												and Broome vrs. Cassel &amp; Co. 
												Ltd. {1972} A. C. 102 both 
												support the legal principles 
												that the time, place and manner 
												of the trespass and the conduct 
												of the Defendant may be taken 
												into account and the Court may 
												award aggravated damages on 
												these grounds.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This Court therefore does not 
												intend to interfere with the 
												findings of fact by the learned 
												trial judge at the Court below. 
												In view of the principle stated 
												in the two cases just cited 
												supra, we affirm that though it 
												was not the physical assault by 
												the Appellant which caused 
												Defendant&#8217;s original injury to 
												his knee; after the trespass to 
												his person, the doctors 
												recommended that he goes back to 
												France for some laboratory tests 
												to be done to assess any fresh 
												damages which may have been done 
												to the knee due to Appellant&#8217;s 
												conduct.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel for Appellant seriously 
												is not contending that there has 
												been a battery committed on 
												Respondent by the Appellant. His 
												only serious contention is that 
												the damages awarded is excessive 
												having regard to the entirety of 
												the claim made by the Respondent 
												by way of general damages.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Following the decisions in the 
												cases of Rookes vrs. Bernard and 
												Broom vrs. Cassell and Co. Ltd.; 
												we are of the opinion that this 
												is not a case where nominal 
												damages must be awarded. We are 
												also of the opinion that the 
												legal axiom &#8220;you take your 
												victim as you find him applies 
												here.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												We therefore dismiss this 
												appeal, affirm the judgment and 
												damages awarded at the Court 
												below.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
