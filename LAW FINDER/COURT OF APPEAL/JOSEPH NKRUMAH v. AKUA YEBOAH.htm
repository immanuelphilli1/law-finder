						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">By the said judgment, 
						the trial judge granted to the plaintiff/Respondent 
						(hereinafter referred to as plaintiff) all the reliefs 
						endorsed on his writ of summons.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff launched 
						this claim at the said Circuit Court for:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) Declaration of 
						title to all that piece and parcel of land situate at 
						Bangromisea on Sefwi Benchemaa Stool land bounded by the 
						Lands of Opanin Yaw Bour (deceased) Akua Yeboah (the 
						Defendant), Kwaku Owusu, (deceased) Kwame Fiakye 
						(deceased) Maame Kwatemaa (deceased) and Kojo Bossompem.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff&#8217;s case is 
						that he is the head of the Asona Family of Sayerano&#8212; 
						Sefwi and Customary successor to his uncle Yaw Bour 
						(deceased) who died in 1998, and brought this action in 
						that capacity.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Plaintiff's uncle who, 
						in his lifetime, was the head of his family, and 
						customary successor to his predecessors, had possession 
						and control of the family properties. These properties 
						were covered by an inventory taken on the 31st May 1995 
						at Sayerano.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The farm land subject 
						matter in dispute was included in the said inventory 
						which was tendered in evidence in this case as Exhibit 
						'B'.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is part of 
						plaintiff's case that after the death of his said uncle, 
						the properties listed in Exhibit 'B' devolved upon him 
						by succession.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Thereafter he went onto 
						the land in dispute to cultivate same, but 
						defendant/appellant (hereinafter referred to as 
						Defendant) and her brothers and sisters prevented him 
						from so doing, and made adverse claims to the land 
						through their late father Kwaku Fuakye who was a member 
						of plaintiff's family and one of his predecessors. 
						Consequent upon the misunderstanding that arose between 
						the plaintiff on the one side and the defendant and her 
						brothers and sisters on the other side, the latter 
						summoned the plaintiff before the chief of Sayerano.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After a panel had gone 
						into the complaint, the defendant and her brothers and 
						sisters were found liable. They were asked to pacify the 
						defendant with a fine of ¢20,000.00 and one bottle 
						Schnapps. Plaintiff by a show of paternal affection, 
						having succeeded defendant's said late father accepted 
						just the bottle of Schnapps. The chief and his elders 
						then pleaded with plaintiff to release the land in 
						dispute to the defendant and her brothers and sisters 
						but plaintiff refused to do it. Eventually it was 
						decided that the land which had brought the dispute be 
						demarcated. When the elders went to the land for the 
						demarcation exercise, the elders directed that the land 
						be divided unto two portions with each side taking one 
						portion.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Defendant and her 
						brothers and sisters would have nothing of this 
						arrangement. They wanted the whole land, and therefore 
						ignored the suggestion from the elders and started 
						working on the land.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In December, 1999 the 
						plaintiff summoned the Defendant before the chief of 
						Sayerano for trespassing unto his family land. In an 
						arbitration that followed, the chief and his elders went 
						into the matter and found defendant liable. She was 
						asked to pay costs of ¢10,000.00. She, however, refused 
						to pay and proceeded to appeal against the arbitration 
						award of the chief and elders of Sayerano to the 
						Omanhene of Sefwi Wiawso. I wonder if this procedure 
						embarked upon by the Defendant was the best. On the 
						announcement of an arbitration award, the parties became 
						bound by it. When plaintiff was invited to the 
						Omanhene's palace, he took an adjournment, and before 
						the return date took out a writ of summons at the 
						Circuit Court, Takoradi claiming the relief's endorsed 
						on his writ of summons and by so doing refused to submit 
						to the Omanhene's purported appellate jurisdiction.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Defendant on her part 
						disputed the claim of the plaintiff, and maintained that 
						the land in dispute formed part of several cocoa farms 
						owned by her deceased father, the late Kwaku Fiakye in 
						his lifetime. Her father's said land was bounded by the 
						farmlands of Kwame Fuakye, Kwasi Amoah, Kwadwo Fuakye, 
						Opanin Duku, Ama Tawiah, Opanin Kwakye, Opanin Danyansa 
						and the Sayera River. According to the Defendant, her 
						father cultivated a big farm with the collective 
						assistance of her father's two wives including her own 
						mother. Her father made intervivos gifts of portions of 
						this farm to each of his said wives. He also gave 
						another cocoa farm to one Yaw Bour ([husband of 
						defendant) on an Abusa tenancy. Her father directed that 
						in the event of the cocoa farm dying, the land should be 
						taken over by defendant. This land according to her is 
						the subject matter in dispute. Defendant denied that her 
						father was related to the plaintiff, neither was her 
						father a member of plaintiff's family.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">She stated that her 
						father hailed from Kwahu area and went to settle at 
						Sayerano in the Sefwi area. Members of plaintiff's 
						family could, therefore, not succeed to her father and 
						could not inherit his properties. Defendant's assertion 
						in this regard raised serious Customary law issues, 
						which were not seriously canvassed in this case, and I 
						will leave them alone.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Defendant, however, 
						admitted the second arbitration proceedings before the 
						chief and elders of Sayerano.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This arbitration was in 
						respect of the land in dispute. She appeared before the 
						chief with her witnesses.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The matter was heard. 
						Both parties and their witnesses gave evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The panel members 
						inspected the land before announcement of the award 
						against her. She, however refused to be bound by it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Defendant having denied 
						the plaintiff&#8217;s claim, filed a counterclaim&#8212;for&#8212;a 
						declaration of title to the land in dispute, an Order of 
						perpetual injunction restraining the plaintiff, his 
						agent, assigns, privies, servants and the like whosoever 
						from entering the said land, an Order compelling the 
						plaintiff to account for all proceeds received from the 
						harvesting of the cocoa from October 1999, and Recovery 
						of possession of the land.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At the end of the 
						pleadings the issues set down for trial were&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(i) Whether the 
						defendant was found liable on 2 occasions in an 
						arbitration [sic] held at Sefwi Sayerano Ahenfie.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(ii) Whether the land 
						in dispute is for the plaintiff or the defendant and her 
						siblings.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(iii)&nbsp; Whether the 
						plaintiff is entitled to his claim.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(iv)&nbsp; Whether the 
						defendant is entitled to his claim</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(v)&nbsp; Any other issue as 
						may appear on the pleadings&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I must observe that 
						there is only one dominant issue, determination of which 
						could resolve the whole matter in dispute. Issue (1) 
						whether the defendant was found liable on 2 occasions in 
						an arbitration [sic] held at Sefwi Sayerano Ahenfie.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At the end of the 
						trial, after the Judge had considered the evidence 
						before him, he accepted the case of the plaintiff and 
						found as a fact that there was a valid Customary Law 
						arbitration held by the chief of Sayerano and his elders 
						in which an award was made in favour of the plaintiff. 
						The Judge held that the defendant was bound by the said 
						award.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial Judge went 
						further to make the following positive findings thus;&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;a party who 
						voluntarily submits to an arbitration is bound by the 
						decision and is, therefore, estopped from relitigating 
						the matter. Quoting for support Acquah J (as he then 
						was) in the case of Suka vrs. Glavee (1991) 1 GLR.194 AT 
						202, the trial Judge stated further&#8212; 'for a valid 
						Customary Law Arbitration award is as potent as a 
						judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction and 
						therefore operates as res judicata.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On these positive 
						findings the trial Judge entered judgment in favour of 
						the plaintiff, and made an Order confirming the said 
						award.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He granted all the 
						reliefs claimed by the plaintiff against the defendant 
						and awarded ¢1 Million damages for trespass against her.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is against this 
						judgment that the defendant has appealed to this Court 
						on the following grounds;&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Originally defendant 
						filed two grounds with an indication that additional 
						grounds would be filed on the receipt of the record of 
						proceedings, this:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						The judgment is against the weight of evidence led at 
						the trial.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) The trial Judge 
						failed to evaluate the legal effect of a Customary 
						arbitration.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Later defendant filed 
						the following additional grounds:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) The trial Judge 
						failed to distinguish between the enforcement of an 
						Arbitration award and re-submitting of a matter to a 
						traditional Court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b)&nbsp; The trial Judge 
						failed to go into the merits of the case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) The trial Judge 
						failed to distinguish between an arbitration and a 
						Customary adjudication.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel for defendant 
						elected to argue ground (b) in the original Notice of 
						appeal and grounds (a) and (c) in the additional grounds 
						of Appeal first and together.</span></p>

						<span style="font-family: Arial">As has already been

						and elders of Sayerano.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Evidence on record 
						spoke of two different matters before the chief and his

						that the second one sent before the chief and elders by 
						the plaintiff was a valid arbitration and that the award 
						was binding on the defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Ground (b) in the 
						original notice of appeal states that &quot;the trial Judge 
						failed to evaluate the legal effect of a Customary

						ground (b) of the additional grounds which states that:
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The trial Judge failed

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">These two grounds

						for defendant thought the Law enjoined him to do.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel, however, 
						failed to state in clear terms what should have been

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In Zabrama vrs. 
						Segbedzi 1991 2 GLR. P.221. Kpegah, J.A. (as he then 
						was) dismissing the appeal held&#8212;&quot;to state in a notice of 
						appeal as did the appellant's counsel, that the trial 
						Judge misdirected himself and gave an erroneous decision 
						without specifying how he misdirected himself, was 
						against the rules and Tendered such a ground of appeal 
						inadmissible. The implications of rule 8 (2) and (4) of 
						the Court of appeal rules 1962 (LI 218)&#8212;now Rules 8(4) 
						and (6) of CI 19&#8212;Court of appeal rules, 1997, was that 
						an appellant after specifying the part of a judgment or 
						Order complained of, must state what he alleged ought to 
						have been found by the trial Judge, or what error he had 
						made in point of Law. It did not meet the requirement of 
						those rules to simply allege 'misdirection' on the part 
						of the trial Judge. The requirement was that the ground 
						stated in the notice of appeal must clearly and 
						concisely indicate in what manner the trial Judge 
						misdirected himself either on the Law or on the facts.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instant case, 
						the two grounds of appeal failed to meet the required 
						standard and were clearly inadmissible. However, the 
						supreme Court in Essilfie vrs. Anafo VI 1993/4 2 GLR 6 
						per Ampiah, JSC has held, the misdirection to be a 
						technicality which should not be fatal to the case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Be that as it may and 
						contrary to Counsel for defendant's assertion that the 
						trial Judge failed to go into the merits of the case, 
						the trial Judge heard full evidence. In his considered 
						judgment, he evaluated the evidence before him, and 
						dealt with facts which had not even been made issues 
						before him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He considered matters 
						like the relationship between the plaintiff's family and 
						the defendant's father. He considered the status of the 
						farm the subject matter in the dispute and finally the 
						validity of the arbitration. There is, therefore, no 
						merit in counsel's assertion that the trial Judge failed 
						to go into the merits of the case. Overwhelming evidence 
						on record testified to the fullest extent to which the 
						trial Judge considered this case on its merits.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Now on ground (a) of 
						the additional grounds, i.e. &quot;that the trial Judge 
						failed to distinguish between the enforcement of an 
						arbitration award and re-submitting of a matter to a 
						traditional Court&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">By this ground, counsel 
						for defendant appeared to have fallen victim to the 
						misunderstanding arising in the use of the expressions 
						&quot;enforcement of arbitration&quot;&#8212;which Acquah J (as he then 
						was) discussed at length in the Suka - case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the said case the 
						trial Judge after comparing the situation under the 
						judicial committee of the Chieftaincy act 1970 where the 
						Committee can forward a copy of the judgment or order to 
						the High Court with a request for execution and upon 
						payment by the applicant of the necessary fees, the High 
						Court shall take such steps and issue such process as 
						may be necessary for the purpose of the execution of the 
						said judgment or order as it would take or issue as if 
						it were a judgment or order of that Court, and a 
						proceeding under Customary arbitration Law where such 
						Jurisdiction is non-existent, stated thus:&#8212;&quot;Most 
						plaintiffs phrase such relief as&#8212;an enforcement of an 
						award. The word enforcing or enforcement as it is 
						sometimes used, is strictly speaking, not the correct 
						word for what the Court is indeed called upon to 
						determine is not an enforcement of award, but a 
						determination of the validity and binding effect of the 
						Customary arbitration and the award made thereby&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Alternatively, instead 
						of claiming an order for the confirmation of the 
						Customary award, an award beneficiary can claim for 
						title, recovery of possession, damages for trespass, and 
						plead or rely on the Customary arbitration award as 
						estoppel. There is, therefore, no distinction between 
						enforcement of Customary arbitration award and an 
						alleged resubmitting of the case to a Traditional Court 
						as is being intimated by counsel for defendant. It all 
						depends upon the procedure adopted, which at the end of 
						the proceeding could bring out the desired result of the 
						determination of the validity of the customary 
						arbitration and its award.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This brings me to 
						ground (c) on the additional ground of appeal. Ground 
						(c) states thus:&#8212;&#8220;The trial Judge failed to distinguish 
						between an arbitration and a Customary adjudication.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Arguing this ground 
						counsel for defendant tried to make a distinction 
						between arbitration proceedings as practiced under the 
						English Common Law and our customary arbitration Law. He 
						tried also to distinguish between proceedings under the 
						customary arbitration and proceedings under what he 
						called customary adjudication.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was counsel&#8217;s 
						submission that at the traditional level of 
						adjudication, like any matter that was resolved by a 
						head of the family or clan head or divisional chief, 
						just as in the regular Courts, decision could be 
						appealed against through their own hierarchical system.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel, therefore, 
						contended that the proceedings before the chief and 
						elders of Sayerano was not a customary arbitration but a 
						customary adjudication and, was appealable.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel contended that 
						during the pendency of the appeal before the Omanhene of 
						Sefwi Wiawso, it was not proper for the plaintiff to 
						have instituted his action at the Circuit Court 
						Takoradi.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This according to 
						Counsel amounted to re-submitting a case on appeal 
						pending before the Omanhene to a traditional Court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel for plaintiff, 
						on his part differed strongly from Counsel for 
						defendant. Counsel for plaintiff contended that what 
						took place before the chief and elders of Sayerano was a 
						valid customary arbitration and so was not appealable. 
						In fact, no matter what name was given to proceedings at 
						Customary Law, once all the essential characteristics of 
						Customary arbitration were present, same could clearly 
						qualify for valid Customary arbitration.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Essential 
						characteristics of Customary arbitration were outlined 
						in the case of Budu vrs. Ceasa [1959] GLR.40 at 4 thus:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) A voluntary 
						submission of the dispute by the parties to arbitration 
						for the purpose of having the dispute decided 
						informally, but on its merits.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) Prior agreement by 
						both parties to accept the award of the arbitration.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) The award must not 
						be arbitrary, but must be arrived at after hearing of 
						both sides in a judicial manner, and </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d) Publication of the 
						award.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have read the 
						proceedings and agree with Counsel for plaintiff that 
						all these key features were present in the customary 
						Arbitration that took place at the palace of the chief 
						of Sayerano. Further, the defendant herself admitted in 
						her evidence that there was the arbitration. Earlier she 
						did not want to submit to the jurisdiction, but on being 
						persuaded by her D.W.I., she submitted to the 
						arbitration. She stated that they led evidence, there 
						was the inspection before the announcement of the award 
						against her.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">What was admitted 
						needed no proof.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I therefore, find and 
						accept that what took place at the Sayerano palace the 
						2nd time was a valid arbitration and that the award was 
						binding on the defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The last ground I want 
						to deal with is original ground (a) on the Notice of 
						appeal, which states&#8212;that &quot;the judgment is against the 
						weight of the evidence led at the trial.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">By this ground the 
						defendant through her Counsel is understood to be saying 
						that the trial Judge failed to consider certain relevant 
						pieces of evidence which if had been considered could 
						turn the scales in her favour or certain pieces of 
						evidence were wrongly considered to her detriment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the word of Counsel 
						for defendant, &quot;the plaintiff is said to have summoned 
						the defendant before the Odikro of Sayerano in respect 
						of the tract of land given to Yaw Bour by Kwaku Fiakye. 
						At the Odikro&#8217;s palace, both parties were called to give 
						evidence and the matter gone into after which judgment 
						was pronounced against the Defendant. The Defendant 
						immediately notified all and sundry that she was going 
						to appeal against the decision at the Omanhene&#8217;s 
						Palace.&quot; Counsel did not state that grounds of 
						defendant&#8217;s intended appeal, neither did he challenge 
						the validity of the proceedings before the chief and his 
						elders, which said proceeding have been held to amount 
						to valid arbitration.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is the same case 
						which plaintiff carried to the Circuit Court for 
						confirmation and which was, in fact, duly confirmed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Evidence on record 
						showed that he trial Judge did not just rubber stamp and 
						confirmed it. He took evidence to determine the validity 
						of the arbitration before confirming it. The trial Judge 
						held:&#8212; &quot;I hold that in this present case the evidence of 
						the defendant and her witnesses having confirmed the 
						case of the plaintiff as to the validity and regularity 
						of the arbitration held by the chief of Sayerano and his 
						elders on the complaint of the plaintiff, the plaintiff 
						has in law discharged the burden in that regard, and the 
						defendant is estopped from relitigating the issue of 
						title to the disputed land. I therefore, enter judgment 
						for plaintiff interms of reliefs (a) (b) of the 
						endorsement on the writ of summons . . . . . . .</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The evidence of the

						the land etc&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The import of the 
						foregoing statement was that before the trial Judge 
						entered judgment in favour of plaintiff, he had 
						satisfied himself of the balance of the weight of the 
						evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial Judge was and

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">His assessment of the 
						evidence cannot be faulted. It is not duty of this court
