												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the 18 June 1993, Society De 
												Promotion De La Pache 
												(hereinafter referred to as the 
												&#8220;plaintiff co&#8221;.) sued the Owners 
												and parties interested in the 
												Ship or Vessel M/V Hilda &#8220;A&#8221; 
												(hereinafter referred to as 
												&#8216;defendant co&#8217;.) and claimed the 
												reliefs stated in the writ of 
												summons. A statement of claim 
												running into six paragraphs was 
												annexed to the writ of summons, 
												in addition to the statement of 
												claim three bills of lading in 
												the original were annexed to the 
												writ of summons. On the date of 
												sealing the writ of summons, 
												lawyers acting for plaintiff co. 
												filed a motion on notice for the 
												arrest of the vessel, Hilda 'A'. 
												Defendant co entered appearance 
												on 25 June 1993 and its lawyer 
												filed an affidavit opposing the 
												application for the arrest of 
												the vessel, Hilda 'A' which was 
												at that date berthed at Tema.&nbsp; 
												The defendant co. acting by its 
												lawyers filed a statement of 
												defense on 23 July 1993. This 
												statement of defense ran into 21 
												paragraphs. The defendant co. 
												did not counter-claim for any 
												relief. The record of appeal 
												shows that it was the defendant 
												co. that set down additional 
												issues for trial in the summons 
												for directions filed on 11 
												October 1993.&nbsp; I did not find 
												the summons for directions filed 
												on behalf of the plaintiff co. 
												in the record of appeal. Be that 
												as it may, the reliefs sought by 
												plaintiff co. were formulated 
												and clearly itemised in its 
												amended statement of claim. 
												After hearing on the merits the 
												trial judge dismissed the whole 
												of the plaintiff co.'s claim and 
												awarded costs against it. The 
												plaintiff co. was dissatisfied 
												and aggrieved by the judgment 
												and appealed to this court on a 
												number of grounds of appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In order to appreciate and 
												understand the issues of law 
												raised and argued in this 
												appeal, I am of the view that 
												the reliefs sought by plaintiff 
												co. must be reproduced in full, 
												especially since defendant co. 
												did not counter-claim for any 
												relief. The plaintiff Co. 
												claimed the reliefs following: &#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;(1) A declaration that the 
												discharge in Tema of fish 
												consigned by the plaintiffs to 
												parties in Abidjan and Lagos is 
												wrongful.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) An order upon the defendants 
												to deliver the fish consigned to 
												parties in Abidjan and Lagos.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3)&nbsp; In the alternative an order 
												upon the defendants to release 
												the said fish to the plaintiffs 
												subject to the cost of freight 
												to the respective destinations 
												of Abidjan and Lagos.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(4)&nbsp; Damages for wrongful 
												conversion</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(5) Perpetual injunction 
												restraining the defendants from 
												discharging 1782.30 tonnes of 
												fish at Tema</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(6) Quia timet injunction.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(7) An order upon the defendants 
												to pay all plaintiffs total and 
												other expenses incidental to 
												defendant's wrongful, 
												appropriation of the plaintiff's 
												fish&nbsp; .......&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The case of the plaintiff co 
												briefly and simply stated is 
												that defendant co. entered into 
												an agreement, evidenced by three 
												separate bills of lading with 
												plaintiff co. under and by which 
												defendant co.&#8217;s vessel, Hilda 
												'A' was to accept for carriage 
												by sea 1782.32 tonnes of fish 
												consigned as per the said way 
												bills to Abidjan, Tema and 
												Lagos. The defendant co.&#8217;s 
												vessel, Hilda 'A' dully and 
												regularly accepted 1782.32 
												tonnes of fish on board in 
												Mauritania. Contrary to the 
												terms and conditions in the 
												three bills of lading, the 
												captain of the Hilda 'A' 
												discharged and off &#8212; loaded all 
												the 1782.30 tonnes of fish at 
												Tema, acting on the instructions 
												of the Managing Director of 
												defendant co.&nbsp; The case of the 
												defendant was stated at great 
												length at paragraph 16 &amp; 17 of 
												the statement of defence as 
												follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;16 The defendant says that its 
												vessel do not apply for hire but 
												carry its own cargo consequently 
												when it went for 1782,30 tonnes 
												of fish it did not require any 
												bills of lading. The defendant 
												will contend that a bill of 
												lading is only prima facie 
												evidence of a contract between 
												the ship owner and a shipper not 
												the contract itself and that at 
												no time did the defendant agree 
												to carry the plaintiffs fish for 
												a fee or otherwise.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												17 The defendant says that the 
												plaintiff not being the owner of 
												the vessel or a charter had no 
												right to issue the bill of 
												lading and the same were 
												irregular and void&quot; I must add 
												that the statement of defense 
												brought into focus transactions 
												between defendant co and other 
												companies.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The first ground of appeal 
												argued by counsel for plaintiff 
												co. was that the judgment was 
												against the weight of evidence. 
												Counsel submitted that plaintiff 
												co, discharged the burden if 
												S.10(1) assumed under and 
												S.11(1) of NRCD 323. He 
												contended that there was 
												undisputed evidence that 
												defendant co. breached the 
												contract of carriage of the fish 
												it accepted to discharge and 
												off-load as per the bills of 
												lading in evidence. He pointed 
												to passages in the judgment by 
												which the trial judge made a 
												finding that defendant co. 
												breached the terms of the 
												contract of carriage. He argued 
												that the trial judge erred in 
												law when he went further and 
												held that IPCO acted as a common 
												agent between plaintiff co. and 
												defendant co. The trial judge 
												erred when he held that the 
												seizure of the fish was lawful. 
												He submitted that the trial 
												judge misdirected himself when 
												he considered extraneous 
												matters, such as the existence 
												of batter agreement between the 
												parties. He submitted that on 
												the evidence before the court 
												the judgment cannot be supported 
												in law. In reply, counsel for 
												defendant co. submitted that the 
												evidence before the court 
												established that plaintiff co. 
												failed to prove its claim.&nbsp; He 
												made copious references to the 
												evidence of Dw2, Capt. Acquah 
												which showed that he Dw2 acted 
												on the express instructions of 
												the owners of the vessel, Hilda 
												&#8216;A&#8217;.&nbsp; He contended that Dw2 
												Capt. Acquah did not enter into 
												any agreement with the plaintiff 
												co. He submitted further that 
												there was no contract of 
												carriage of fish between the 
												defendant co. and the plaintiff 
												co. He contended that there was 
												a batter agreement between 
												defendant co. and plaintiff co 
												and this what the trial judge 
												believed and accepted. He 
												concluded his statement thus:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;In his lordship's view, the 
												bill of lading did not evidence 
												any new agreement independent of 
												the batter agreement and for 
												this reason he stated further 
												that the basis of</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												the plaintiff's claim was 
												therefore completely eroded. I 
												must observe that the plaintiff 
												co. did not sue for breach of a 
												barter carriage by sea agreement 
												between it and the defendant co. 
												The plaintiff co sued for breach 
												of contract of the defendant co. 
												pleaded at paragraph 4 of the 
												statement of defence that it 
												defendant co. had an existing 
												agreement with a Namibian 
												company called Erongo Sea 
												Products Ltd. The defendant 
												pleaded at paragraph 6 of the 
												statement of defense another 
												agreement with a Nigerian Co. 
												called International Processing 
												Co. Ltd. I fail to see the 
												reason behind these pleadings 
												these companies are not parties 
												to the action before the court. 
												Again at paragraph 9 of the 
												statement of defense the 
												defendant co. pleaded as 
												follows.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;9.&nbsp; It was further agreed that 
												the defendant&#8217;s vessel known as 
												Hilda &#8216;A&#8217; should together carry 
												a further 790 tonnes of gas oil 
												to the plaintiff said transfers 
												&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												To pause here for a moment, the 
												defendant co. had not identified 
												plaintiff co. as a party to this 
												&#8220;further agreement.&#8221;&nbsp; Again the 
												obligation undertaken by 
												plaintiff co. under and by 
												virtue of this further agreement 
												was entered into with IPCO it 
												becomes clear that plaintiff co. 
												not being a party is not bound 
												by this &#8220;further agreement&#8221;.&nbsp; 
												Indeed the terms pursuant to 
												which gas oil was supplied to 
												plaintiff co. enjoined IPCO, and 
												not the plaintiff co., to pay 
												for the gas oil.&nbsp; This was 
												pleaded at paragraph 10 of the 
												statement of defendant thus:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;10. IPCO further arranged with 
												the plaintiff to pay the 
												defendant the gas oil supplied 
												to it with fish and undertook to 
												pay the defendant if the 
												plaintiff defaulted &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221; I do 
												not read into paragraph 10 of 
												the statement of defense any 
												right power or authority given 
												to defendant co. by plaintiff 
												co. to fraudulently and 
												wrongfully discharge and off 
												load fish undisputedly, bona 
												fide property, of plaintiff co. 
												and not property of IPCO at 
												Tema.&nbsp; In my opinion it was 
												fraudulent and mischievous on 
												the part of defendant Co. to 
												plead at paragraph 14 thus:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;14. The defendant says that the 
												purported consignees other than 
												the defendant was in breach of 
												the accord reached between the 
												plaintiff and the defendant 
												acting through IPCO &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..&#8221; 
												There was on pleadings no such 
												accord between the plaintiff co. 
												and the defendant co.&nbsp; The 
												accord was between IPCO and 
												defendant co.&nbsp; The plaintiff on 
												the pleadings took a benefit 
												under the accord but plaintiff 
												co. was in law not liable to 
												defendant co.&nbsp; The accord did 
												not give defendant co. a lien on 
												the fish belonging to plaintiff 
												co.&nbsp; In my view if plaintiff co. 
												failed to supply the defendant 
												with fish the right and power 
												given to the defendant Co. 
												pursuant to the accord was a 
												right to demand payment from 
												IPCO for services rendered in 
												the first place and not a right 
												to claim property of plaintiff 
												co.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Indeed the evidence led by 
												defendant Co. through DW2 Capt. 
												Acquah was in conflict with the 
												defense put forward in the 
												pleadings. Dw2 testified that he 
												was under strict orders from the 
												owners of the Hilda &#8216;A&#8217; to take 
												instruction from one Abass who 
												was resident in Mauritania as to 
												what goods he accepts for 
												carriage on board Hilda &#8216;A&#8217;.&nbsp; He 
												stated further that Abass would 
												instruct him as to the 
												destination of the goods, he Dw2 
												accepts on board the Hilda &#8216;A&#8217;.&nbsp; 
												It was not the evidence of Dw2 
												that he was sent by his Managing 
												Director to Mauritania to load 
												fish belonging to the ship owner 
												of Hilda &#8216;A&#8217; and to bring the 
												fish straight back to Tema.&nbsp; On 
												the evidence before the court, I 
												have no doubt that Dw2, Captain 
												Acquah received and took on 
												board the quantity of fish which 
												were to be discharged and 
												off-loaded according to the 
												express and clear provisions and 
												terms on the three bills of 
												lading.&nbsp; Dw2 as a captain of a 
												ship know or ought to know the 
												efficacy and purpose of a bill 
												of lading.&nbsp; Indeed Dw2 Capt. 
												Acquah knew and was aware that 
												he Dw2 was not the owner of the 
												fish on board his vessel. Again 
												Dw2 knew he was not the owner of 
												the fish on board his vessel.&nbsp; 
												Again Dw2 knew he was not the 
												owner of the vessel.&nbsp; On this 
												issue he testified as follows:</span></p>

												In my view Exhibit B in plain 
												and clear language spelt out the 
												conditions and terms of the 
												contract of carriage between 
												plaintiff co. and the defendant 
												co. By the terms of&nbsp; Exhibit B 
												and the contents of the bills of 
												lading the respective 
												obligations and duties in law of 
												the contracting parties enjoined 
												Dw2 Capt. Acquah perform the 
												obligation and duly he undertook 
												to discharge and perform the 
												duty authorised and empowered 
												representative of Kiku Co. Ltd.&nbsp; 
												It was not in law, open to Dw2 
												Capt. Acquah to unilaterally 
												change, alter or amend the terms 
												of the documents Exhibit B, 
												Exhibit Al, Exhibit A2 and 
												Exhibit A3. He had in law no 
												right or power as a captain of 
												the ship to breach these 
												obligations and duties. In law 
												failure of on the part Dw2 Capt. 
												Acquah to strictly and 
												religiously carry out and 
												discharge the conditions and 
												terms in these documents 
												amounted to a breach of the 
												contract of carriage. The 
												evidence on record showed that 
												Dw2 Acquah prior settling sail 
												for Mauritania was instructed to 
												contact and to meet with Abass 
												in Mauritania and to take any 
												and all instructions from 
												Abass.&nbsp; In his evidence he 
												stated thus:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;When he had received on board 
												his vessel a total of 1782 
												tonnes of fish, he went to the 
												office of Abass for the 
												necessary documents particularly 
												the clearance to enable him sail 
												from Mauritania&quot;.&nbsp; In the 
												present appeal the necessary 
												documents which enabled Capt. 
												Acquah, Dw2, to sail out of 
												Mauritania were the three bills 
												of lading,&nbsp; Exhibits Al, A2 &amp; 
												A3. On the evidence on record 
												part only of the fish was as per 
												the bills of lading consigned to 
												Tema. The shipowner defendant 
												co. was not on the evidence 
												before the court, the true and 
												lawful owner of the fish on 
												board its vessel, 'Hilda A' then 
												under the command of Capt. 
												Acquah, Dw2. The law on this 
												issue is clear and plain and is 
												as stated in his statement of 
												case by counsel for SPP

												Delivery under Contract</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Shipowner must generally see 
												that the goods are delivered to 
												the person to whom he has 
												contracted to deliver them. That 
												is to say, as a rule to the 
												person named as consignee in the 
												bill of lading or to the 
												assignee of the person who is 
												empowered by the bill of lading 
												to make an order or assignment 
												of it .................&#8221; In the 
												instant case, DW2 Capt. Acquah 
												did not give evidence that in 
												respect of the fish consigned 
												respectively to Abidjan and 
												Lagos he had the consent and 
												authority in writing of the 
												persons named as consignees in 
												the bills of lading for Abidjan 
												and Lagos to discharge and off 
												load the fish consigned to 
												Abidjan and Lagos at Tema and to 
												defendant co.&nbsp; The conduct and 
												action of Dw2 Capt. Acquah, in 
												law, amounted to a conversion of 
												the fish intended for the 
												consignees in Abidjan and 
												Lagos.&nbsp; Capt. Acquah&#8217;s conduct 
												and action amounted to a breach 
												of the contract of carriage of 
												the fish to Abidjan and Lagos.&nbsp;

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;It is perfectly clear law that 
												a shipowner who delivers goods 
												without production of the bill 
												of lading does so at his peril&nbsp; 
												&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Delivery to a person not 
												entitled to the goods without 
												production of the bill of lading 
												is prima facie quality of 
												conversion of the goods and 
												breach of contract.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the instant appeal Dw2 Capt. 
												Acquah did not produce the 
												authority and consent of S.P.P 
												to discharge and off load the 
												whole consignment of fish at 
												Tema. I have not found a shred 
												of evidence that ownership of 
												the total consignment of fish 
												was in defendant co.&nbsp; The 
												consignment of fish intended to 
												be discharged and off loaded at 
												Tema must and ought at all 
												material times to be dealt with 
												and treated separately and 
												distinctly from the consignment 
												of fish to Abidjan and Lagos. On 
												this issue I reproduce the 
												passage following from carrier's 
												Book:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;As between the owner and 
												shipper of the goods and the 
												captain the bill of lading fixes 
												and determines the duty of the 
												latter (the captain) as to the 
												person to whom it is (at the 
												time of the delivery of the 
												goods) the pleasure of the owner 
												of the good should be delivered 
												&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. The owner of the goods may 
												change his purpose at any rate 
												before the delivery of the goods 
												themselves, or of the bill of 
												lading to the party named in it 
												and may order the delivery to be 
												to some other person to B 
												instead of to A.&#8221;&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is clear from the statement 
												of the law that the power to 
												make changes in relation to the 
												ultimate consignee of goods on 
												board a ship covered by a bill 
												of lading vested solely and only 
												in the owner of the goods and 
												most certainly not in the owner 
												of the ship.&nbsp; In the instant 
												case, the Managing Director of 
												Kiku Co. did not have a legal 
												right to order changes in 
												respect of and touching upon the 
												consignment of fish intended and 
												destined for Abidjan and Lagos. 
												The evidence on record was that 
												he, it was who ordered Dw2 Capt. 
												Acquah to wilfully and 
												contemptuously breach the 
												contract of carriage of the fish 
												intended and destined for 
												Abidjan and Lagos respectively. 
												In my opinion, the defendant co. 
												breached the contract of 
												carriage only in respect of the 
												consignment of fish intended for 
												Abidjan and Lagos.&nbsp; The finding 
												and conclusion of the trial 
												judge on this crucial&nbsp; issue 
												cannot be supported in law.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial judge regrettably 
												failed to appreciate the real 
												issue in dispute between 
												plaintiff co. and defendant co. 
												Thus in formulating what he 
												perceived and understood as the 
												real issue in dispute between 
												plaintiff co and defendant co. 
												he expressed himself thus:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The existence of the 
												contractual relationship which 
												in real terms is between the 
												plaintiffs and the defendants 
												places the defendants in a 
												position in which they can deal 
												directly with the plaintiffs and 
												pursue any claim arising out of 
												the contractual relationship 
												which</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												has been brought into being by 
												the activities of IPCO who acted 
												on common agents of both 
												parties.&#8221; With respect to the 
												trial judge, the case before him 
												was simply the claim by 
												plaintiff co that defendant co, 
												breached a contract of carriage 
												by sea of fish belonging to 
												plaintiff co by defendant co. 
												the plain duty of the trial 
												judge was to determine whether 
												or not on the evidence before 
												him the defendant co. breached 
												the contract of carriage of the 
												fish.&nbsp; In my view whether or not 
												the defendant co. could 
												counter-claim for non-payment of 
												auto gas supplied to the 
												plaintiff co was not an issue 
												raised on the pleadings in the 
												case before him.&nbsp; Indeed the 
												trial judge did recognise that 
												defendant co. had &#8220;a claim to 
												pursue against the plaintiff co 
												and also against IPCO&quot;. In the 
												present case the defendant Co. 
												had not pursued &#8220;that claim&quot; 
												against the plaintiff co. The 
												trial judge, suo moto, put up 
												that counter-claim. He erred in 
												law in putting up a 
												counter-claim for defendant co. 
												This was how the trial judge 
												expressed himself:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;In any case, I do not think 
												that this attempt by the 
												plaintiffs to treat the carriage 
												of fish to the three 
												destinations as a separate 
												transaction between the 
												plaintiffs and defendants would 
												serve any purpose .........&#8230;.. 
												Therefore an attempt to separate 
												the previous transaction of 
												supply of AGO and fish from the 
												transport of fish which is the 
												subject matter of this 
												litigation would not be 
												appropriate &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												From the trial judges 
												appreciation and understanding 
												of the case before him, there 
												were plainly and clearly three 
												separate and unrelated 
												transactions.&nbsp; These are: (1) 
												The contract to supply A.G.O; 
												(2) the contract to supply fish; 
												and (3) the contract &#8220;to 
												transport&#8221; fish.&nbsp; In law the 
												three separate contracts gave 
												rise to three separate causes of 
												action.&nbsp; There was only one 
												contract before the trial court, 
												and the trial court was called 
												upon to determine and pronounce 
												on&nbsp; the reliefs claimed in the 
												writ of summons. The trial judge 
												erred in the opinion expressed 
												as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The opinion of the Court is 
												that the three bills of lading 
												do not evidence any new 
												agreement independent of the 
												barter agreement existing 
												between them.&nbsp; It would not do 
												if we restrict ourselves to the 
												three bills of lading although 
												by the nature of the plaintiffs 
												claim the Court is called upon 
												to do just that and limit itself 
												to the three bills of lading.&quot;
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial judge gravely erred in 
												the view he took of the case 
												before him. The defendant co. 
												made it plain and clear in its 
												statement of defence that the 
												agreement to supply AGO to the 
												vessel mentioned in evidence 
												were not entered into by the 
												plaintiff co. either directly or 
												indirectly. The defendant co. 
												failed and or omitted to 
												counter-claim any relief against 
												the plaintiff co. Again the 
												defendant co. failed and or 
												omitted to join and claim 
												against IPCO as a party to the 
												action it under that agreement. 
												More importantly defendant co. 
												failed and or omitted to put in 
												issue for determination &quot;the 
												better agreement &quot; which 
												agreement the trial judge, suo 
												moto, raised as an issue for his 
												determination. In any case the 
												defendant co. did admit the 
												claim of the plaintiff co. at 
												para 15 of the statement of 
												defense thus:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;15 Save that the defendant 
												admits that its vessel carrying 
												the fish did not go to Abidjan 
												para 4 of the statement of claim 
												is denied.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The evidence on record fully 
												supported the above admission, 
												namely that all the fish on the 
												vessel were discharged and 
												off-loaded at Tema. In my view 
												the plaintiff co was entitled to 
												judgment on the admission in the 
												absence of a set-off by way of a 
												counter-claim properly 
												formulated for consideration by 
												the trial court.&nbsp; This right was 
												not exercised by the defendant 
												co in the action.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Finally finding that the 
												judgment of the trial judgment 
												cannot be supported is 
												established and proved by the 
												passage following from the 
												judgment:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;In his written address counsel 
												for defendant Co, sought to 
												demonstrate that going by the 
												figures provided by the 
												representative of IPCO, Pw1 in 
												his oral evidence the defendants 
												would not in any way be indebted 
												to the plaintiffs.&nbsp; I do not 
												intend to go into that aspect of 
												the case for the simple reason 
												that that is completely 
												unrelated to the plaintiff&#8217;s 
												claim which has to do with 
												breach of contract which 
												according to them is evidence by 
												the three bill of lading&#8221;.&nbsp;
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												To express the real issue in 
												dispute between plaintiff co and 
												defendant co. the real issue 
												trial judge stated his 
												perception as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;It means therefore that for our 
												purposes we have to limit 
												ourselves to the issue of breach 
												of contract raised by the 
												plaintiffs pleadings.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In my opinion that was the only 
												issue for trial.&nbsp; The defendant 
												co. had not and did not raise 
												any issue by way of 
												counter-claim for determination 
												by the trial judge.&nbsp; The real 
												issue in dispute between the 
												parties, was whether or not the 
												defendant co. breached the 
												contract of carriage of fish to 
												Abidjan and Lagos respectively.&nbsp; 
												The simple and plain case of the 
												plaintiff that the consignment 
												of fish intended and destined 
												for Abidjan and Lagos never 
												reached these two places was 
												admittedly proved by the 
												evidence on record the judgment 
												on this issue was wrong and 
												cannot be supported.&nbsp; In the 
												result I find that in respect of 
												the consignment of fish to be 
												discharged and off loaded at 
												Tema the defendant co. was not 
												on breach of contract and the 
												judgment in favour of defendant 
												co was right in law.&nbsp; The appeal 
												succeeds in part.&nbsp; There will be 
												judgment for the plaintiff in 
												respect of the breaches of 
												contract in relation to the 
												bills of lading for Abidjan and 
												Lagos respectively.&nbsp; The 
												judgement in respect of the 
												consignment of fish to Tema and 
												discharged and off-loaded at 
												Tema is hereby affirmed.</span></p>

												This is an appeal against the

												Accra, delivered on the 19th 
												January 1996 in favour of the 
												respondent, then defendant to 
												the law suit.&nbsp; The appellant, a 
												company registered in 
												Mauritania, brought the suit or 
												action against the respondent, a 
												company registered in Ghana, 
												claiming damages for breach by 
												the respondent of a contract 
												under which the latter agreed 
												for a fee, to convey specified 
												quantities of fish to specified 
												consignees in Abidjan, Lagos, 
												and Tema respectively, and for 
												fraudulent conversion of the 
												said fish. Further claims all of 
												which cannot be enumerated but 
												are on record were made for an 
												order against the respondent for 
												the return to the appellant as 
												owners of the fish or its 
												release to the accredited 
												consignees in the aforementioned 
												cities. An order of injunction 
												against the respondent was 
												requested by the appellant to 
												literally consummate its 
												composite claim.&nbsp; Some 
												reasonably detailed account of 
												the appellant case and that of 
												the respondent would advance a 
												fuller and better understanding 
												of the crucial issues of law 
												that predominated the trial 
												vis-a-vis the issues of fact 
												which were, to a large extent 
												not in serious contention 
												between the parties. The 
												respondent agreed to discharge 
												178.30 metric tonnes of fish 
												belonging to the appellant on 
												the terms highlighted above. The 
												carriage was accompanied by 
												three bills of lading each of 
												which described and named the 
												consignee to which or whom the 
												respondent was to deliver the 
												fish in their respective 
												proportions. The bills of lading 
												were tendered at the trial as 
												Exhibit A Exhibit A1 and Exhibit 
												A2 without any objection.&nbsp; Also 
												tendered and admitted without 
												any objection was an affidavit 
												sworn to by the captain of the 
												respondent&#8217;s vessel 
												register-named &#8220;M/V Hilda A&#8221; by 
												which he acknowledged receipt

												paragraphs 1 to 5 of the amended 
												statement of claim filed on the 
												6th July 1993.&nbsp; The case of the 
												respondent on the other side was 
												that a certain amount of money 
												which was due and owing to it 
												from a company called &#8220;Erongo&#8221; 
												was paid to another company 
												called International Processing 
												Company Ltd. registered in 
												Nigeria (hereinafter called 
												&#8220;IPCO&#8221;) for onward transmission 
												to the respondent but IPCO did 
												not honour the obligation.&nbsp; 
												Instead IPCO used the money in 
												purchasing gas oil for use by 
												vessels belonging to the 
												appellant and part of the money 
												was used to charter vessels for 
												supplying some 3,300 tons of gas 
												oil for the appellant's vessels. 
												The respondent further alleged 
												that its two vessels &quot;Hilda A&quot; 
												and &#8220;Sandra&#8221; A carried to the 
												appellant's trawlers additional 
												quantity of gas oil bringing the 
												overall supply of gas oil to 
												4,090 metric tonnes.&nbsp; The oil 
												supplied valued $818,000.00 
												(818US Dollars).&nbsp; The respondent 
												averred in paragraph 11 of its 
												statement of defense that IPCO 
												arranged with the appellant to 
												pay the respondent for the gas 
												oil supplied to it in kind, that 
												is, with fish and undertook to 
												pay the respondent if the 
												appellant dispatched 718 metric 
												tonnes of fish at $240.00 per 
												ton as part payment. At this 
												juncture I would rather than 
												paraphrasing reproduce 
												paragraphs 12 to 17 of the 
												respondent's statement of 
												defense:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												12.&nbsp; Subsequent to this delivery 
												the defendant was informed by 
												IPCO that the plaintiff was 
												ready with another consignment 
												of fish to complete the payment 
												of the gas oil the defendant 
												therefore dispatched its vessel 
												'Hilda A' to the plaintiff to 
												collect the fish. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												13. The defendant says that the 
												plaintiff loaded the defendant's 
												said vessel with 1782.30 metric 
												tonnes of fish and then issued 
												Liner Bills of Lading to the 
												Captain purporting to consign 
												the fish to consignees in 
												Abidjan and Lagos with a small 
												quantity to the defendant 
												without any prior notice to the 
												defendant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												14. The defendant&nbsp; says that the 
												purported re-designation of the 
												fish to consignees other than 
												the defendant was a breach of 
												the accord reached between the 
												plaintiff and the defendant 
												acting through IPCO and that it 
												was calculate to delay or defeat 
												the defendant&#8217;s right to be 
												paid.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												15. The defendant says it was 
												justified in ordering its 
												captain to discharge the fish in 
												Tema as previously agreed upon.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												16. The defendant says that its 
												vessels do not ply for hire but 
												carry its own goods.&nbsp; 
												Consequently when it went for 
												the 1782.30 tonnes of fish it 
												did not require any bill of 
												lading.&nbsp; The defendant will 
												contend that a bill of lading is 
												only prima facie evidence of a 
												contract between ship owner and 
												shipper, not the contract itself 
												and that at no time did the 
												defendant agree to carry the 
												plaintiff&#8217;s fish for a fee or 
												otherwise.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												17. Paragraph 5 of the statement 
												of claim is denied.&nbsp; The 
												defendant says that the 
												discharge of the fish was 
												legitimate and pursuant to a 
												previous agreement meant to 
												enable the plaintiff to pay to 
												the defendant the cost of fuel 
												supplied to it from founds 
												belonging to the defendant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												From a careful study of the 
												judgment the following findings 
												of fact and conclusions of law 
												drawn from them appear very 
												transparent on the record 
												namely:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) that prior to the day the 
												disputed consignment of fish was 
												put on the vessel Hilda A in 
												Mauritania and the bills of 
												lading were prepared and 
												executed, an agreement existed 
												between the appellant and the 
												respondent and this was a barter 
												agreement whereby the parties 
												agreed to trade in fish and gas 
												oil on barter basis</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) that the said agreement had 
												come into existence through the 
												instrumentality of IPCO</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(c) that IPCO was the agreed 
												common agent of the parties</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(d) That the three bills of 
												lading could not constitute a 
												contract between the parties 
												whatever their execution &#8212; At 
												page 184 of the record the 
												learned judge put the matter 
												beyond all peradventure thus: 
												&#8220;Since the court has come to a 
												conclusion that on new 
												agreement, independent of the 
												earlier barter agreement was 
												brought into being by the three 
												bills of lading the whole basis 
												of the plaintiff&#8217;s claim is 
												eroded which would not allow 
												their claim to succeed?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(e) That the respondent had 
												therefore acted lawfully within 
												the perimeters of the barter 
												agreement in taking the disputed 
												fish.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												With these positive findings and 
												conclusions, the learned trial 
												judge found no difficulty 
												whatsoever in dismissing the 
												claim of the appellant.&nbsp; Against 
												this decision the appellant has 
												appealed on a number of 
												grounds.&nbsp; First learned Counsel 
												for the appellant argued 
												together his additional grounds 
												A &amp; B.&nbsp; The cutting edge of that 
												argument was that the learned 
												trial judge misdirected himself 
												on the law when he held that the 
												three bills of lading did not 
												constitute a binding contract 
												between the appellant and the 
												respondent.&nbsp; Counsel hurled 
												strictures on the learned trial 
												judge for what he termed 
												&#8220;introducing extraneous matters 
												into the contract of 
												affreightment&#8221; Counsel contended 
												that there was contract of 
												carriage between the appellant 
												and the respondent evidenced by 
												the three bills of lading and 
												the respondent was under an 
												obligation to comply with the 
												said terms and conditions to the 
												specified consignees and 
												consequently the respondent was 
												guilty of a breach of contract 
												when it appropriated the fish to 
												itself. By &#8216;extraneous matter&#8217; I 
												understood counsel to be making 
												an obvious reference to the 
												barter agreement which the 
												learned trial judge accepted as 
												the operative and binding 
												contract and upon which the 
												respondent based its defense of 
												justification for the seizure of 
												the disputed fish.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As counsel for the appellant 
												pointed out and, rightly in my 
												view, the burden of persuasion 
												lay squarely on the respondent 
												to establish the plea of 
												justification which implied an 
												admission that it committed the 
												act complained of but no legal 
												sanction can be attached to it.&nbsp; 
												And the burden is: Was there in 
												law any proof of a contract 
												between the appellant and the 
												respondent?&nbsp; If there was any 
												which one was it?&nbsp; I have 
												carefully examined the record of 
												the appeal in its entirely, 
												particularly answers to 
												questions in cross-examination 
												of the witnesses but I was 
												unable to lay hands to the real 
												indicator of the truth anywhere 
												else than the following 
												testimony of Pw1 the Managing 
												Director of IPCO at page 86 of 
												the record and I quote:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;I know the Plaintiff Company, I 
												also know the Defendant 
												Company.&nbsp; The plaintiff is 
												supplier of fish from Mauritania 
												to my company.&nbsp; My company works 
												together with the Defendant 
												Company in Nigeria, Lagos and 
												Warri to import fish on his 
												vessels Hilda A and Sandra A.&nbsp; 
												My company&#8217;s arrangement with 
												SPP is to supply us with frozen 
												fish from Mauritania such as 
												Horse Mackerel, Sardinella 
												Mackerel.&nbsp; The terms are that 
												they supply us with fish and we 
												pay them either by transfer on 
												L.C. or by Cash.&nbsp; I do not know 
												of any arrangement between SPP 
												and Kiku Co. Ltd.&nbsp; There is an 
												arrangement between me and the 
												plaintiff to send the plaintiff 
												vessels to transport fish&#8221;.&nbsp; 
												This testimony speaks for 
												itself.&nbsp; Then on the issue of 
												supply of gas oil for fish, the 
												following question and answer 
												during cross-examination of 
												respondent&#8217;s representative 
												appears at page 141 of the 
												record:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Q.&nbsp; Who accounts to Kiku for the 
												Ago and for the sale of your 
												fish?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is IPCO</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Q.&nbsp;&nbsp; You keep account with IPCO?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They keep my account.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore if any oil or 
												fish is due to you the people 
												you ask to account is IPCO?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ordinarily yes. The same 
												people asked me to go to 
												Mauritania to the plaintiff&#8217;s to 
												collect fish.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												With these pieces of evidence 
												considered along with several 
												others of similar import and 
												connotation it is my holding 
												that the view held by the 
												learned trial judge that IPCO 
												was the common agent to both the 
												appellant and the respondent was 
												unsupportable.&nbsp; The true colour 
												of IPCO, as I see it, is that of 
												a master mind for both parties 
												whom it exploited to its 
												business advantage as and when 
												the occasion became propitious.&nbsp; 
												A clear example can be found 
												from the pleadings of the 
												respondent where it is averred 
												the IPCO induced it to establish 
												letters of credit in a bank upon 
												a guarantee made by IPCO to pay 
												the money if the appellant 
												defaulted to pay IPCO.&nbsp; There 
												was no evidence that the 
												appellant ever became aware of 
												this arrangement between IPCO 
												and the respondent.&nbsp; It is trite 
												law that in a true agency 
												transaction, an agent must 
												communicate to his principal the 
												commitments made on his behalf 
												for ratification within a 
												reasonable time.&nbsp; The stance I 
												have taken of the case is 
												supported by exhibit D when 
												carefully studied and construed 
												in its full tenor.&nbsp; The contents 
												of Exhibit D are clear testimony 
												of the fact that at some stage 
												both the appellant and the 
												respondent realised the extent 
												to which IPCO had horse-ridden 
												both of them.&nbsp; Throughout the 
												trial it was the respondent, 
												rather than the appellant who 
												had insisted that IPCO had been 
												acting as common agent.&nbsp; The 
												appellant had never as far as 
												the record went regarded or 
												treated IPCO as a common agent 
												to both parties. &nbsp;In my humble 
												assessment of the evidence, I 
												was unable to share the holding 
												of the learned trial judge that 
												a barter agreement subsisted 
												between the appellants and the 
												respondent.&nbsp; The business 
												arrangement that existed was, as 
												far as I could discern from the 
												record was between IPCO and the 
												respondent with regard to 
												exchange of gas oil for fish.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I now proceed to consider 
												additional grounds C &amp; D which 
												touched upon the legal status of 
												the three bills of lading 
												Exhibits A, A1 and A2.&nbsp; On this 
												legal issue I wish to throw a 
												search light on a passage at p. 
												44 of the 10th edition of 
												Carver&#8217;s &#8220;Carriage of Goods By 
												Sea&#8221;:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;A doubt has sometimes been 
												raised whether the bill of 
												lading is a conclusive statement 
												of the contract between the 
												shipper and shipowner, or is 
												only one piece of evidence, 
												helping with others to show that 
												the contract is, and so subject 
												to be contradicted, or varied or 
												added to, by verbal or other 
												evidence, to show the agreement 
												between the parties. The 
												question is important, for if 
												the bill of lading is the 
												statement of the contract; it 
												cannot, in the absence of fraud 
												or mistake be altered or added 
												to by any evidence of 
												preliminary or contemporaneous 
												negotiations or agreements on 
												the subject matter of the 
												contract.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The learned author further 
												recognizes that there is 
												conflict of authority on the 
												subject but he prudently 
												concludes his discussion on the 
												issue by the following opinion 
												at P.47 of the book:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The true view of the 
												authorities may be that it 
												depends on the facts of each 
												case whether the bill of lading 
												contains the actual contract.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												All that the learned author has 
												succeeded in doing, like all 
												other text writers is to throw 
												us back to basics, that is the 
												question of whether in a given 
												constellation of facts a 
												contract in law really exists.&nbsp; 
												My elementary knowledge about a 
												contract starts with the word 
												agreement.&nbsp; The term agreement 
												is often employed to signify a 
												state of affairs where the minds 
												of two persons or parties who 
												are negotiating an arrangement 
												have arrived at a definite and 
												identical conclusion, a position 
												which is technically described 
												as &#8220;consensus ad idem&#8221; An 
												agreement of this nature which 
												is intended by the parties to 
												have legal consequences is best 
												described as a contract.&nbsp; It 
												always consists of or involves 
												exchange of promises and such 
												promises if intended to be 
												binding are called contract: See 
												Perbi v. Attorney General (1974) 
												2 GLR 167 on offer and 
												acceptance, Addo v. Hartey 
												(1972) 2 GLR 318 CA on exchange 
												of promises and again Perbi v. 
												Attorney-General on intention to 
												create legal relations.&nbsp; I also 
												had the opportunity of reading 
												the case of Buama v. Oppony 
												(1992) 2 GLR 213 HC where Benin 
												J. (as he then was) dealt with 
												the basic principles of contract 
												citing the leading English 
												authorities and with particular 
												reference to the liability of 
												persons who undertake to carry 
												goods for a fee but fail to 
												ensure that the goods reach 
												their destination.&nbsp; Above all, 
												there was the West African Court 
												of Appeal case of G.B. Ollivant 
												Ltd. v. Arab (1955) 15 WACA 9 
												where the following headnote 
												appears: &#8220;Carriage of 
												goods&#8212;Independent 
												contractor&#8212;Conversion of goods 
												by servants committed in the 
												course on employment.&#8221;&nbsp; All 
												these case raise a very serious 
												indictment against any person 
												who undertakes for a fee to 
												convey goods belonging to 
												another person but appropriates 
												the goods to his own use. The 
												respondents testifying before 
												the trial court through their 
												representative stated that they 
												exercised a lien on the fish.&nbsp; 
												But the question that arises is: 
												Upon what contract did the 
												respondent purport to exercise 
												the lien. The law is that a lien 
												arises by contract or more 
												usually by accepted usage or 
												custom. A general lien which 
												arises from contract is a right 
												to detain goods not only for 
												debts incurred in connection 
												with them, but also for a 
												general balance of account 
												between the owner and the 
												possessor, but no lien can arise 
												unless the goods over which the 
												lien is claimed have come 
												lawfully into the possession of 
												the person who claims the lien 
												in the ordinary course of 
												business: See Sundolf v. Alfred 
												(1883) 3 M &amp; W (Messon &amp; Welsby) 
												248.&nbsp; In the instant case as the 
												IPCO representative Pw1 stated 
												in his evidence at P.86 and I 
												quote:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;I do not know of any 
												arrangement between SPP and Kiku 
												Co. Ltd. There is an arrangement 
												between me and the plaintiff 
												(i.e. SPP) to send the plaintiff 
												vessels to transport fish&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Also in Exhibit D which can be 
												found at P.193 of the record of 
												appeal in the last paragraph, 
												the respondents are recorded to 
												have stated in a letter 
												appellant the following:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;However if at the conclusion of 
												accounting reconciliation 
												between the defendant and IPCO 
												regarding the total business 
												transacted, including deliveries 
												of AGO to your good selves any 
												account is due form us to IPCO 
												we undertake to pay the amount 
												due to cover the cargo to you&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In my humble understanding the 
												above statement unequivoably 
												demonstrates or reflects the 
												uncertain and indeterminate 
												legal relationship that existed 
												between the respondent and the 
												appellant all due to the 
												intermeddling role of IPCO. 
												Under such circumstances, when 
												there was the need to go into 
												the state of accounts between 
												the stakeholders in the bizarre 
												business scenario, it was in my 
												view improper for the respondent 
												to seize the fish under the 
												guise of a lien.&nbsp; As counsel for 
												the appellant rightly submitted 
												relying on the celebrated case 
												of Foaser v. Telegraph 
												Constrictions Co. (1872) LR 7 QB 
												566 at 571 where Blackburn J 
												said:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The bill of lading must be 
												taken to be the contract under 
												which goods are shipped and 
												until I am told differently by a 
												Court of or I shall so hold&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The three bills of lading 
												tendered in this case as Exhibit 
												A, A1 and A2 constituted a 
												contract between the parties.&nbsp; 
												The facts of the Fraser case 
												(supra) showed that the shipper 
												signed the bill of lading.&nbsp; In 
												the instant case, the captain of 
												the Hilda A, the respondents 
												vessel, signed an undertaking 
												Exhibit B swearing that he would 
												deliver the goods to the 
												consignees named in the bill of 
												lading.&nbsp; The facts of this case, 
												therefore, fall on all fours 
												with Fraser&#8217;s case.&nbsp; On the 
												authorities, Fraser&#8217;s case is 
												good law (see detailed analysis 
												at pages 44 &#8211; 48 of Carvier&#8217;s 
												&#8220;Carriage of Goods By Sea&#8221; 
												(supra).&nbsp; In my judgment the 
												learned trial judge erred when 
												he held that the bills of lading 
												in the instant case did not 
												constitute a binding contract 
												between the appellant and the 
												respondent.&nbsp; The respondent was 
												in clear breach of contract and 
												it had no justification 
												whatsoever in taking possession 
												of the consignment of fish 
												intended for consignees in Lagos 
												and Abidjan.&nbsp; The fact that the 
												appellant company&#8217;s Managing 
												Director reported the conduct of 
												the Minister of Agriculture is 
												to me clear evidence that the 
												appellant had not been made 
												aware of the true nature of the 
												business transaction in which he 
												had got his company involved.&nbsp; I 
												am sure that the appellant has 
												learnt his lesson.&nbsp; For the 
												foregoing reasons, I would allow 
												the appeal.&nbsp; The judgment of the 
												High Court is hereby set aside.&nbsp; 
												In lieu thereof judgment is 
												entered for the appellant.</span></p>
