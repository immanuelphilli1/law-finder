						<span style="font-family: Arial">ARYEETEY, J.A.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A background to this 
						appeal is as follows: The plaintiff/respondent, as 
						Sub-Contractor, entered into an agreement, exhibit A, 
						with the second defendant/appellant-company, as 
						Contractor, on 15th June 1998 for the excavation of 
						foundations and erection of 221 steel towers for 
						electricity transmission of 34.5 KV line between 
						Kumbungu and Daboya in the Northern Region. The contract 
						price payable to the respondent is stated in the 
						agreement. It is the case of the respondent that the 
						appellants unilaterally reduced the number of towers to 
						be erected to 42 without any justification, which was in 
						violation of clause 1.7 of exhibit A. The respondent 
						contends further that while he was making excavations in 
						respect of Towers Numbers 1-42 the appellants stopped 
						him without giving him the notice required under Clause 
						1.7 of exhibit A. According to the respondent the 
						termination of the contract by the appellants was also 
						contrary to Clauses 2.1, 3.1. and 3.2. of exhibit in 
						that when the appellants terminated the contract they 
						failed to pay moneys due to him as well as the cost of 
						materials.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Since the respondent 
						referred to Clause 3.1 and Clause 3.2 as having been 
						violated by the respondents I would reproduce them in 
						full for a better appreciation of the nature of his 
						claim. They area as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;3.1 Contractor may, at 
						its option, terminate Sub-Contract at any time in whole 
						or in part by written notice hereof to Sub-Contractor 
						whether or not Sub-Contractor is in default and whether 
						or not Main Contract is subject to termination. Upon 
						receipt of any such notice, Sub-Contractor shall, unless 
						the notice directs otherwise, immediately discontinue 
						works on the date and to the extent specified in the 
						notice, place not further orders or Sub-Contracts for 
						materials, equipment, services or facilities except as 
						may be necessary for completion of such portion of the 
						works as is not discontinued, promptly make every 
						reasonable effort to proceed with cancellation upon 
						terms satisfactory to Contractor of all orders. 
						Sub-Contracts and rental agreements to the extent they 
						relate to the performance of works discontinued and 
						shall thereafter do only such work as may be necessary 
						to preserve to protect works already in progress and to 
						protect materials, plant and equipment at the project 
						site or in transit thereto.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3.2 Upon such 
						termination, Sub-Contractor shall be entitled to be paid 
						the value, calculated on the basis of the payment 
						provisions of the Sub-Contract, of all the works 
						properly carried out on the site by Sub-Contractor 
						together with reasonable costs occasioned by and 
						directly resulting from such termination and not 
						previously paid for, less such sums as Sub-Contractor 
						has already received on account of the work performed. 
						If, at the time of such termination, Sub-contractor has 
						properly prepared or fabricated off the site any goods 
						for subsequent incorporation at the site and if 
						Sub-Contractor delivers such goods to the site or to 
						such other place as Contractor shall reasonably direct, 
						the Sub-Contractor shall be paid for such goods or 
						materials.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Also, according to the 
						respondent even though he was permitted to work on 42 
						towers which would cost ¢69,416,803.00 he ended up with 
						only 40 and was therefore paid ¢13,360,762.28 less than 
						the contract price. The other assignments carried out by 
						him for which he was not paid by the appellants were 
						excavation works for the foundations and construction of 
						Tower Numbers DE4, DE42, SS104, SS107, SS110, and SS111 
						at a total cost of ¢10,530,000 as well as survey work in 
						respect of Towers 43 to 164. Therefore in the court 
						below the plaintiff/respondent's claim against the first 
						defendant and second/defendants/appellants jointly and 
						severally was for the following reliefs:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) Special and General 
						damages for breach of contract entered into between the 
						plaintiff and 2nd defendant on or about 15th day of June 
						1998 for the erection of Steel Tower of 34.5 KV Lines 
						between Kumbungu and Daboya in the Northern Region of 
						Ghana.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) Balance of payment 
						for work done but which the defendants have not yet paid 
						to the plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) Cost of Survey from 
						Tower 43 to Tower 164.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d) ¢400,000.00 being 
						the cost of 4 trips of River Sand.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">All along the 
						appellant's stand has been that the reduction in the 
						number of the steel towers to be worked upon by the 
						plaintiff was not a unilateral action by them but was in 
						exercise of their right under exhibit A, which allowed 
						them to incerase or decrease the number of steel pillars 
						to be constructed. According to them the plaintiff 
						indeed agreed to the decrease in the number of steel 
						towers to be erected to avoid the payment of penalties 
						to be incurred if the project is not executed on 
						schedule. That was after they had written to the 
						plaintiff complaining about the unsatisfactory manner in 
						which he carried out the work and instructing him to 
						complete the foundations of Towers Nos. 2 to 41 before 
						15th July 1998. Even then the plaintiff was unable to 
						complete the work on schedule in spite of several 
						letters written to him cautioning him about the delay. 
						The defendants further contend that they did not 
						terminate the agreement wrongfully and that on the 
						plaintiff's own admission in an agreement on his 
						letterhead dated 12th October 1998, signed by both 
						parties, the agreement was lawfully terminated and both 
						partied were discharged from all further obligations.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 
						defendants/appellants filed four grounds of appeal 
						namely:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) That the judgment 
						is against the weight of the evidence</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) That the trial 
						judge erred when he held that the defendants had 
						breached the contract agreement executed between the 
						parties;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) That the trial 
						judge erred when he found as a fact that the defendants 
						owed the plaintiff ¢13,360,762.28 and ¢10,530,000.00 for 
						works done;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d) That the trial 
						judge erred in not giving proper consideration to 
						exhibit 2 executed between the plaintiff and the 
						defendant</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff 
						cross-appealed and his grounds were:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) The quantum of 
						damages awarded is too small in view of the fact that 
						the contract entered into by the plaintiff and the 
						defendants provides a penalty clause of 1 to 15 percent 
						of the contract price per week.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) The learned judge 
						applied wrong principle in his assessment of damages in 
						this case that has led to a miscarriage of justice 
						against plaintiff/appellant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) The learned judge 
						erroneously considered the principles of vicarious 
						liability and this has led to the erroneous exclusion of 
						the first defendant/respondent from liability in this 
						case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">However it appears from 
						the written submissions of plaintiff's counsel that no 
						attention was paid to the grounds of the cross-appeal. 
						So I take it that the plaintiff does not to pursue the 
						cross-appeal any longer and so what we have to look at 
						are only the grounds of the appeal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I would first like to 
						take grounds (a) and (b) of the defendants grounds of 
						appeal together, namely: &quot;(a) That the judgment is 
						against the weight of the evidence and (b) That the 
						trial judge erred when he held that the defendants had 
						breached the contract agreement executed between the 
						parties&#8221;. It is worthy of note that paragraphs 5-7 of 
						the plaintiff's Statement of Claim specify the Clauses 
						in the agreement, exhibit A in respect of which the 
						defendants' breach of the agreement relates. They read 
						as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;5. By Clause 1.7 of 
						the agreement &#8216;in the event of default, failure or delay 
						on the part of Sub-Contractor, Contractor may nominate 8 
						days after prior notice to Sub-Contractor, a specified 
						person, firm or company to carry out any part(s) of the 
						Works where Contractor considers such action appropriate 
						and on receiving contractor&#8217;s notice, Sub-Contractor 
						shall leave the site.&#8217;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">6. When plaintiff was 
						engaged in the excavation of foundation for towers 1 to 
						42 and the erection of the towers the first defendant 
						without giving the required notice to the plaintiffs 
						stopped them from the excavation of some of the 
						foundations for the towers. This action of the 1st 
						Defendant was in breach of Clause 1.7 of the agreement 
						between the plaintiff and the defendants.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">7. The defendants 
						verbally and wrongfully terminated the plaintiff&#8217;s 
						Sub-contract contrary to Clauses 1.7, 2.1, 3.1 and 3.2 
						of the agreement.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It would be convenient 
						at this stage to look at Clause 1.7 of exhibit A. It 
						reads:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;1.7 Without Prejudice 
						to any other applicable provision herein contained and 
						at the sole option of the Contractor in the event of 
						default, failure or delay on the part of Sub-Contractor, 
						Contractor may nominate 8 days after prior notice to 
						Sub-Contractor, a specified person, firm or company to 
						carry out any part(s) of the Works where Contractor 
						considers such action appropriate and on receiving 
						contractors notice, Sub-Contractor shall leave the site.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After quoting the 
						contents of Clause 1.7 of exhibit A the learned trial 
						judge in his judgment had his to say at pages 75 and 76 
						of the record of appeal respecting the meaning and 
						effect of the sub-clause as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Counsel for the 
						defendants submitted that the Contractor has very wide 
						discretion under the contract including this Clause 1.7. 
						Indeed this is true. However, the discretion under this 
						Clause 1.7 is a conditional one. The conditions 
						precedent to the invocation by the Contractor of the 
						discretion under this clause are (1) There must be a 
						default, failure or delay on the part of the 
						Sub-contractor, and (2) There must be 8 days prior 
						notice to the Sub-contractor. The onus is on the 
						Contractor to establish that these pre-conditions 
						existed at the time he purported to exercise his 
						discretion. If both or any one of these preconditions 
						did not exist the exercise by the Contractor of his 
						discretion would be wrongful... At the time the 2nd 
						defendant exercised its discretion to stop the plaintiff 
						from the further works the first precondition did not 
						exist and I so find... There was no evidence before me 
						that any notice of default, failure or delay was given 
						to the Sub-contractor. This is quite understandable. The 
						notice was to be given if there was a default, delay or 
						failure on the part of the Sub-contractor. I have 
						already held that the Contractor had not shown the 
						existence of any default, failure or delay on the part 
						of the Sub-contractor. Hence no notice could properly 
						have been given and I find that no notice had been given 
						when the Contractor suspended all work in respect of the 
						steel towards beyond T42.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In asking the plaintiff 
						not to perform the works beyond T42 the 2nd defendant 
						was unilaterally repudiation the contract, exhibit A, in 
						respect of Towers T43 to T221, i.e. 179 towers in all. 
						The request was in breach of the contract. It was then 
						up to the plaintiff to treat the contract as at an end 
						in respect of T43 to T221 and make a claim for breach of 
						contract later while the contract continued to exist in 
						respect of TI to T42.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Subsequently by exhibit 
						1 Towers 1 and 42 were also taken out of the contract. 
						This constituted another breach of contract as here, 
						too, the necessary preconditions did not exist for the 
						termination of the contract even under clause 2 or 3.1. 
						For the 2nd defendant to purport to terminate the whole 
						of exhibit A on 12th October 1998 was an exercise in 
						futility. By that date exhibit A had long ceased to 
						exist because of prior breaches by the 2nd defendant.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In his preoccupation 
						with Clause 1.7 of exhibit A the learned trial judge did 
						not take cognisance of the opening words of the Clause, 
						that is, &quot;Without prejudice to any other applicable 
						provision herein contained&quot;. If he had it would have 
						been obvious to him that the defendants' right to 
						exercise his discretion is not limited to the instance 
						depicted in Clause 1.7 of exhibit A. What the learned 
						trial judge sought to do was to fit the conduct of the 
						defendants as depicted by exhibit 1 into the straight 
						jacket of Clause 1.7 which admittedly lists 
						preconditions for the exercise of discretion by the 
						defendants, as amplified by the portion of the judgment 
						of the court quoted above. What the trial judge should 
						have done was to have looked at the whole agreement as 
						suggested by the opening words of Clause 1.7 quoted 
						above. Looking at the contents of exhibit 1, what took 
						place was that the defendants did not terminate the 
						whole of the agreement. They merely reduced the number 
						of steel pillars the plaintiff was to construct. The 
						question to ask is, &#8220;Were the defendants by the 
						agreement entitled to do that?&#8221; A look at Clause 2.1 of 
						exhibit A provides a clear answer. It reads:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;2.1 In lieu of giving 
						notice of termination, Contractor may notify its 
						decision to take part only of Sub-Contract Works out of 
						the hand of the Sub-Contractor and may by itself, its 
						servants or agents execute, complete and maintain such 
						part and in such event Contractor may recover the cost 
						of so doing from Sub-Contractor, or deduct such costs 
						from monies otherwise becoming due to Sub-Contractor.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It cannot be denied 
						that exhibit 1 for all intents and purposes did not 
						constitute termination of the contract. It falls in line 
						with what Clause 2.1 of the agreement, exhibit A, which 
						permits the defendants to reduce the number of towers 
						the plaintiff was to construct under the contract 
						without assigning reasons for so doing. However in this 
						case the defendants in exhibit 1 pointed out to the 
						plaintiff, as sub-contractor, his delay in the execution 
						of the contract, which might result in the payment of 
						penalty by the defendants as contractors. From all 
						indications the plaintiff did not challenge the 
						defendants' exercise of their right under Clause 2.1 of 
						the agreement. In fact he initialled the document 
						containing the new arrangement and followed what exhibit 
						1 required him to do to the letter. The evidence is that 
						he co-operated fully with the defendants and carried out 
						what he was required to do under exhibit 1. It appears 
						to me that the reason why the learned trial judge came 
						to the conclusion that the defendants had breached the 
						agreement was the fact that he restricted himself to the 
						provision in the agreement which relates to termination, 
						that is Clause 1.7 of exhibit A. It is ironical that 
						Clause 1.7 itself by its opening phrase that is: 
						&quot;Without prejudice to any other applicable provision 
						herein contained', puts one on notice that there are 
						other options in the agreement open to the defendants 
						apart from their right to terminate the agreement under 
						specified circumstances stipulated in Clause 1.7 and 
						highlighted in the judgment of the court below at pages 
						75 and 76 of the record of appeal as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Counsel for the 
						defendants submitted that the contractor has very wide 
						discretion under the contract including this Clause 1.7. 
						Indeed this is true. However, the discretion under this 
						Clause 1.7 is a conditional one. The condition precedent 
						to the invocation by the Contractor of the discretion 
						under this Clause are (1) There must be a default, 
						failure or delay on the part of the sub-contractor, and 
						(2) There must be 8 days prior notice to the 
						sub-contractor. The onus is on the contractor to 
						establish that these pre-conditions existed at the time 
						he purported to exercise his discretion. If both or any 
						one of these pre-conditions did not exist the exercise 
						of the contractor of his discretion would be wrongful.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As can be seen the 
						defendants in real terms did not purport to terminate 
						the agreement under Clause 1.7 of exhibit A. They 
						exercised their options as permitted by Clause 2.1 of 
						exhibit A and therefore their conduct in reducing the 
						number of towers to be constructed would not amount to 
						wrongful termination of the contract. As shown in 
						exhibit 1 the reduction of number of towers to be 
						constructed by the plaintiff did signify a variation of 
						the terms of exhibit A, which was permitted by Clause 
						2.1 of the agreement.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I would now have a 
						brief look at grounds (c) and (d) of the grounds of the 
						appeal, which I intend to take together. As a reminder 
						they read as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(c) That the trial

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						exhibit 2, appears at page 87 of the record of appeal on 
						the plaintiff's own letterhead and signed by both 
						parties. It reads:</span></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendants' project 
						manager, Stephen Graff, who testified on the defendants' 
						behalf gave the circumstances under which exhibit 2 was 
						made at page 35 of the record of appeal as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;When he was not doing 
						the work we informed him formally in September 1998 that 
						we were terminating the contract; and invited him to our 
						office on 12/10/98 to do the final reconciliation 
						together. He came to the office on 12/10/98. We 
						discussed all the matters in terms of payment, work done 
						and final agreement. Plaintiff issued his final invoice 
						for payment&#8230; on 12/10/98 when we met we paid the 
						plaintiff ¢10,300,000 which represents ¢4,800,000.00 as 
						payment of the retention on the previous invoice 
						submitted by plaintiff plus ¢5,500,000.00 to buy some 
						materials from plaintiff. Money paid him included work 
						done by plaintiff. After paying all these monies we 
						signed final agreement specifying that nobody would come 
						back to claim any money.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff has not

						party agreed not to pursue any further claim for money. 
						I am therefore of the view that taking into account the 
						contents of exhibit 2, the conclusion of the trial court 
						that the defendants owed the plaintiff various sums of 
						money was erroneous. For the reasons given in this 
						judgment I would allow the appeal and set aside the
