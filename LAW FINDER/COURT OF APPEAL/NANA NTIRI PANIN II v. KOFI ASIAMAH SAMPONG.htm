												My Lords, we are in this appeal, 
												which arises from the refusal by 
												the Circuit Court, Mpraeso, to 
												accede to an application for the 
												grant of an interlocutory 
												injunction at the behest of the 
												appellant (to whom I shall for 
												convenience in these proceedings 
												refer as the plaintiff and to 
												the respondent similarly refer 
												as the defendant) concerned with 
												the question whether the 
												exercise of the discretion by 
												the court below was right? I now 
												pause to say that in determining 
												this appeal this court is not to 
												substitute its own discretion 
												for that of the court below but 
												on the contrary, examine the 
												exercise of the discretion in 
												the light of the materials 
												placed before him with a view to 
												discerning if he came to a 
												reasonable decision on the 
												application whose refusal has 
												resulted in these proceedings. 
												He must in this regard direct 
												himself properly in law by 
												directing his attention to all 
												relevant matters and excluding 
												from his attention those which 
												are irrelevant to the 
												determination before him. The 
												circumstances in which the 
												proceedings before us arise have 
												been stated by the learned trial 
												judge in great detail and I 
												think that what remains to be 
												done is for us to carefully 
												examine the exercise of his 
												discretion in refusing the 
												application, a refusal that has 
												provoked the instant 
												proceedings.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I have examined the record 
												before us and I am of the 
												considered view that having 
												regard to the nature of the 
												controversy before the court 
												below the refusal to grant the 
												interlocutory injunction was 
												wrong. I am of the opinion that 
												having rightly stated the 
												principles which must in such 
												cases guide the court the 
												learned trial judge misapplied 
												the law as declared by him to 
												the facts of the case. What this 
												means is that on the materials 
												placed before him in the 
												application which was tried by 
												resort to affidavit evidence the 
												learned trial judge came to a 
												view of the matter which upon a 
												proper and reasonable 
												consideration ought not to have 
												led to its dismissal. In this 
												wise, I wish to refer to pages 
												45 to 47 of the record of 
												proceedings before us at which 
												the learned trial judge 
												expounded the applicable law in 
												a manner which I accept as 
												correct by reference to decided 
												cases on the matter. In 
												particular, I refer to his 
												reference to the case of 
												American Cyanamid v. Ethicon 
												Ltd. (1975) A.C 398 and the 
												quotation of some passages from 
												the said judgment in the course 
												of his ruling as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;&#8230;&#8230;.the governing principle is 
												that the court should first 
												consider whether if the 
												plaintiff were to succeed at the 
												trial in establishing his right 
												to a permanent injunction he 
												would be adequately compensated 
												by an award of damages for the 
												loss he would have sustained as 
												a result of the defendant&#8217;s 
												continuing to do what was sought 
												to be enjoined between the time 
												of the application and the time 
												of the trial.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In my thinking the above 
												exposition coming as it were 
												after he had referred to the 
												relevant case law regarding the 
												requirement that the applicant 
												must show that the action before 
												the court in respect of which 
												the application was brought was 
												not rooted in vexation and or 
												frivolity, the learned trial 
												judge cannot be in any way be 
												faulted on his exposition of the 
												law but when one goes further to 
												consider after he had asked 
												himself the right questions at 
												page 48 regarding the&nbsp; 
												consideration of whether on the 
												facts of the case either party 
												was likely to suffer irreparable 
												injury, that is injury of a 
												nature not remediable by the 
												grant of an award in damages in 
												the event of a refusal of the 
												application, there is a clear 
												indication at page 49 of the 
												record that he delivered himself 
												erroneously when he said as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;In my opinion considering the 
												pleadings and the affidavits 
												filed by the parties, I am view 
												that the defendant is likely to 
												suffer irreparable damage if the 
												application is granted and he 
												eventually succeeds at the 
												trial. For example, the cost of 
												building materials would be 
												higher, considering the nature 
												of the inflation spiral in the 
												country.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the other hand the plaintiff 
												would have nothing to lose if at 
												the end of the case judgment is 
												given in his favour. This is 
												because in assessing damages the 
												Court will take into 
												consideration the fact that 
												throughout the period of the 
												trial he has been deprived of 
												the use of the land by the 
												defendant. Also the court can 
												order the defendant to demolish 
												to the ground level whatever 
												structure the defendant would 
												have built on the land.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In view the learned trial 
												judge's decision on the nature 
												of damages to be occasioned to 
												the plaintiff was wrong in that 
												at the state of the proceedings 
												before him when he was required 
												to rule on the conflicting 
												rights of the parties to the 
												action none of the rights 
												asserted had been clearly 
												established which meant that 
												there was a credible dispute as 
												to those rights and accordingly 
												he ought to have prevented 
												either party from proceeding to 
												exercise as against the other 
												any of those disputed rights 
												particularly as was the case 
												regarding the act of the 
												defendant it was such as was 
												reasonably likely to change the 
												character of the disputed land. 
												I think that on the facts the 
												learned trial judge came to an 
												unreasonable view of the matter 
												by not granting the application 
												for an interlocutory injunction 
												as sought by the plaintiff 
												against the defendant subject to 
												the plaintiff giving an 
												undertaking in respect of 
												damages which might be sustained 
												by the defendant in the event of 
												the plaintiff not succeeding at 
												the end of the trial, the 
												damages in this regard being the 
												difference in the building cost 
												as a result of the order of 
												injunction. It is clear from the 
												processes placed before the 
												court below in respect of the 
												application that the plaintiff 
												was possessed of the land for a 
												considerable time either in fact 
												or constructively before the 
												defendants entry on same and as 
												such in my opinion the ocurt 
												ought not to have enabled the 
												defendant to continue with his 
												act in respect of which the 
												action was commenced until a 
												final determination of the rival 
												claims to the disputed land. I 
												think that taking into account 
												all the circumstances the order 
												as substituted in this delivery 
												is one which does no injustice 
												to any of the parties; for 
												beyond treating them equally by 
												not giving undue advantage to 
												either of them it preserves to 
												them the right to deal 
												subsequently with the land in a 
												manner which he thinks fit after 
												their respective rights have 
												been finally determined by the 
												court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I wish to observe that very 
												often our court in considering 
												applications for interlocutory 
												injunctions do not appear to 
												advert their minds to the 
												requirement in Order 50 rule 
												7(2) that such orders &quot;may be 
												made either conditionally or on 
												such terms or conditions as the 
												court thinks just&quot;. I am of the 
												opinion that this aspect of the 
												exercise of the court's 
												jurisdiction in the grant of 
												interlocutory injunctions is 
												quite important; for it enables 
												the court to take into account 
												matters such as in the case 
												before us the need to balance 
												the respective conflicting 
												rights in a manner which accords 
												with the requirements of &#8220;good 
												conscience&quot; and &quot;good faith&quot;, 
												the principles which guided the 
												Courts of Chancery of old in 
												developing a system of law that 
												is now commonly known as 
												&quot;equity&quot; by the imposition of a 
												term or condition regarding the 
												order which has been appealed to 
												us by way of an undertaking by 
												the defendant whose objection to 
												the grant was upheld for 
												instance that when he loses the 
												action he would quietly yield up 
												possession of the disputed land&nbsp; 
												in favour of the plaintiff. This 
												way in my thinking the court 
												would have been exercising its 
												jurisdiction with a view to 
												doing real justice in a manner 
												that led to the development of 
												the equitable jurisdiction which 
												today in our jurisdiction is 
												part of the common law. Clearly 
												the making of the order appealed 
												without due regard to the 
												imposition of reasonable terms 
												or conditions having regard to 
												the to the conflicting rights 
												of&nbsp; the parties in the matter 
												also provides a legitimate 
												ground for impeaching the 
												order.&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Therefore, in my judgment I 
												proceed to allow the appeal 
												herein and in place of the order 
												of dismissal of the application 
												for the grant of an 
												interlocutory injunction made an 
												order directed at the defendant 
												by himself, workmen agents and 
												assigns restraining them from 
												carrying out construction works 
												on the land in dispute pending 
												the final determination of the 
												action herein in the court 
												below. This order is to last 
												until further or other order.</span></p>
