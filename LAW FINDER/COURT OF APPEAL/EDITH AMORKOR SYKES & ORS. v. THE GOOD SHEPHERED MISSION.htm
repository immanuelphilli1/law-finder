						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On 10th November, 1997 
						we dismissed the appeal. These are my reasons for doing 
						so.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The respondents, who 
						are the owners of a two bedroomed house at South East 
						Christiansborg leased the premises to the appellants, 
						the Good Shepherd Mission in or about September, 1989. 
						An essential term of the lease agreement was that the 
						appellants were to carry out certain developments on the 
						premises within a year of the agreement and to remain in 
						occupation of the said premises for a period of 21 
						years. However, barely six months after the said 
						agreement has been entered into, the respondents, 
						contending that a fraud has been perpetrated on them, 
						(by the appellants, acting through their representative 
						Brother Appiah-Kubi) abrograted the agreement. According 
						to the Respondents, the parties however agreed that in 
						order to liquidate an amount of ¢300,000.00 which the 
						appellants had paid as rent advance, they should remain 
						in occupation for a further period of eight years. When 
						at the expiry of this eight-year period, the appellants 
						refused to yield vacant possession of the premises, the 
						respondents instituted proceedings, principally to 
						recover possession. In addition they also claimed 
						damages for deceit and mesue profit. After both summons 
						for directions and additional summons have been filed by 
						the parties, the appellant moved the court for an order 
						for (1) stay of proceedings and (2) for reference of the 
						said matter to arbitration on the grounds that by the 
						lease agreement, all disputes arising from the said 
						tenancy agreement are resolvable by arbitration. The 
						court declined the prayer. Being dissatisfied with the 
						ruling, the appellant promptly appealed to this court on 
						three grounds. At the hearing, however, the appeal was 
						argued on only one ground. The other two were abandoned. 
						The burden of the appellants argument was that once the 
						parties have agreed on the forum for the resolution of 
						disputes arising from the contract, the court was in 
						duty bound to refer this particular action to 
						arbitration. Counsels further contention is that 
						arbitrators are not in any case excluded from 
						determining questions of fraud that may be raised by one 
						of the parties. Furthermore, he urged that as what the 
						respondents have by their pleadings done is merely to 
						allege fraud, without any disclosure on the pleadings 
						that the appellant has been convicted by a court of 
						competent jurisdiction for fraud, theirs was a mere 
						allegation and the court ought not to have assumed 
						jurisdiction. It was argued that on the contrary, the 
						court ought to have declined jurisdiction and referred 
						the matter to the forum the parties themselves by a 
						prior agreement had chosen, namely arbitration. 
						Respondent counsel&#8217;s answer to these arguments were 
						equally straight-forward. Counsel contends that the 
						ruling ought not to be disturbed for two reasons.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">First, that their 
						pleadings contain sufficient facts to support their 
						allegation of fraud. They maintained that having 
						particularised the fraud, they have done all that the 
						law of Section 27 (b) of the Arbitration Act, Act 38 
						requires of them and which is to state on the face of 
						their pleadings the case of fraud clearly and with 
						particularity counsel argued that would be stretching 
						the law too far if we demanded that the pleadings must 
						disclose that the appellant has in fact been convicted 
						by a court of competent jurisdiction.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Second, it was urged 
						that the objection to the court&#8217;s jurisdiction ought to 
						have been taken timeously, at the date of the filing of 
						the defence. The argument therefore is that the 
						application for stay of proceedings was filed too late, 
						when summons for directions have already been filed. 
						Under such circumstances, counsel contended, the 
						appellant ought to be deemed to have waived their rights 
						existing under the arbitration clause.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I propose to deal with 
						this last point, i.e., whether the appellant is deemed 
						to have waived his rights under the arbitration clause 
						first, as it seems to me to be the easier matter to 
						dispose of.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In response to 
						respondent counsel&#8217;s submission that appellants have not 
						acted timeously, counsel relying on Kusi v. Shell Ghana 
						Limited (1973) 1 GLR 173 contended that the present 
						position of the law as contained in Section 8 of the 
						Arbitration Act, 1961, Act. 38 is that an application 
						for stay of proceedings may be brought at any time after 
						the writ has been issued but before actual hearing. The 
						Kusi case dealt with the Section 5 of the previous law 
						on arbitration, the arbitration on Ordinance Cap. 16 
						(1951) Rev. But counsel had contended that the wording 
						of Section 8 of the present Arbitration Act, Act 38 is 
						exactly the same as the Section 5 of the Ordinance and 
						therefore the Kusi case could and if anything at all be 
						of persuasive authority in construing the Section 8 in 
						our attempt to decide the question of the stage at which 
						an application for stay of proceedings may be brought, 
						where one party wishes to invoke an arbitration clause 
						in an existing contract. I have no doubt that in my mind 
						that appellant counsel&#8217;s contention would have found 
						favour with us if this assertion that the wording of the 
						two pieces of legislation are the same were correct. 
						Unfortunately such is not the case. The two legislation 
						- the repeated and the present are materially different. 
						In the previous legislation that is the Section 5 of the 
						ordinance, the law clearly stipulated the time within 
						which such applications i.e. applications for stay of 
						proceedings were to be brought. An applicant was obliged 
						to apply for a stay of proceedings &#8220;after the writ had 
						been filed and before the hearing.&#8221; No such time limit 
						was set by the Section 8 of the Arbitration Act, Act 38 
						and no court has power to read any such words into this 
						present legislation. Indeed the fact that these words 
						were excluded from the Act 38 shows the legislature did 
						intend to leave those words out and not set any time 
						limit at all. I will reproduce the two relevant laws. 
						Section 5 of the Arbitration Ordinance Cap. 16 (1951) 
						Rev. States as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;If any party to a 
						submission or any person claiming through or under him 
						commences any legal proceedings in any court against any 
						other party to the submission, or any person claiming 
						through or under him, in respect of any matter agreed to 
						be referred, any party to such legal proceedings may at 
						any time, after service of the writ of summons before 
						the date fixed for hearing apply to that court to stay 
						the proceedings and that court or judge thereof if 
						satisfied that there is no sufficient reasonably the 
						matter should not be referred in accordance with the 
						submission, and that the applicant was, at the time when 
						the proceedings were commenced, and still remains, ready 
						and willing to do all things necessary to the proper 
						conduct of the arbitration, may make an order staying 
						the proceedings.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Section 8 of Act 38 on 
						the other hand provides:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;If any party to an 
						arbitration agreement, or any person claiming through 
						him commences any legal proceedings in any court against 
						any other party to the agreement as any person claiming 
						through him in respect of any matter agreed to be 
						referred any party to those legal proceedings may apply 
						to that court to stay the proceedings, and that court, 
						if satisfied that there is no sufficient reasonably the 
						matter should not be referred in accordance with the 
						agreement, and that the applicant was, at the time when 
						the proceedings were commenced, and still remains ready 
						and willing to do all things necessary to the proper 
						conduct of the arbitration, may make an order staying 
						the proceedings.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is therefore clear 
						that under the present law, a party who seeks to apply 
						for an order a stay of proceedings under the Section 8 
						of the Arbitration Act, Act 38 has no specific time 
						limit within which to bring the said application. But 
						then the more pertinent question raised by this appeal 
						is this: does it mean the application then can be 
						brought at any time at all even at such late stages as 
						where the applicant has participated fully in the 
						hearing and judgment is about to be delivered? I do not 
						think so. I shudder to think that the mere fact that no 
						express time limit have been fixed by the law gives an 
						applicant the licence to submit applications for stay or 
						proceedings tardily. In other words such applications 
						must be timeous. This in fact is the respondent 
						counsel&#8217;s contention. Arbitration or indeed agreement to 
						arbitrate is a purely consensual arrangement. It does 
						follow that parties to an agreement to refer differences 
						to arbitration, especially when such agreements are 
						contained in existing contracts are also equally free to 
						agree to its suspension or even termination. And it is 
						precisely because they have the right to waive their 
						rights existing under the arbitration agreement that it 
						is illogical or inconceivable for a party wishing to 
						enforce an arbitration agreement to be tardy otherwise 
						an undue delay in raising objection to the court&#8217;s 
						jurisdiction, coupled with other positive acts as for 
						example participating actively in an actual hearing, 
						etc., may be construed as having taken such steps as 
						would amount to a waiver of their rights to enforce the 
						arbitration agreement. What of course amounts an undue 
						delay resulting in a waiver of an applicant&#8217;s right is a 
						question of fact determinable on the facts of the 
						particular case. In other words, whether or not an 
						applicant in an application for stay of proceedings has 
						acted timeously is a question of fact to be determined 
						on the particular facts of each case. What I propose to 
						do therefore is to determine whether in this particular 
						case the applicant is guilty of any delay.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The claim that the 
						appellant failed to act timeously is not borne out by 
						the record. Indeed, he cannot be accused of any undue 
						delay in raising the objection to the court&#8217;s 
						jurisdiction. On the contrary, the record shows that at 
						the earliest opportunity, when they filed their defence, 
						they raised this issue. True, the defence does not 
						explicitly state that the court&#8217;s jurisdiction was being 
						challenged neither is there any invitation to stay 
						proceedings. Certainly I do not think it would have been 
						proper to extend any such invitation to the court in the 
						statement of defence. But the paragraph 30 of the 
						defence in substance clearly demonstrates that they were 
						objecting to the court&#8217;s jurisdiction and were 
						contending that the proper forum for resolving their 
						differences was arbitration. By this they were serving 
						notice that they were not waiving any rights at all, but 
						rather, if anything at all insisting on their rights. 
						The paragraph reads:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Defendant also say 
						that the plaintiffs claim is premature having regard to 
						the mandatory requirement for arbitration provided in 
						clause 16 of the agreement.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A twenty-three 
						paragraphed reply followed the defence. By the twenty 
						third paragraph, the respondents denied this fact by the 
						paragraph 30 of the defence, prompting the appellants to 
						include in the additional issues they filed on 20th 
						January, 1997, the paragraph 13 which reads as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;13 whether or not the 
						plaintiffs action is premature.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Two days later, on 22nd 
						January, 1997, they then filed the motion which 
						culminated in this present appeal. In my opinion then, 
						the appellant had at all material time, as far as the 
						issue of the Court&#8217;s jurisdiction or the reference of&nbsp; 
						the matter of arbitration is concerned acted diligently, 
						timeously and with promptitude. In my view, there has 
						been no delay, let alone an undue delay on the 
						appellant&#8217;s part such as would amount to a waiver of 
						their rights under the arbitration clause. Neither would 
						the filing of a statement of defence, coupled with the 
						filing of additional issues amount to having taken a 
						fresh step in the action such as would lead to a waiver 
						of their rights. Similarly I do not think the mere fact 
						that they did not file the motion for stay of 
						proceedings along with the defence renders their

						<span style="font-family: Arial">The next important 
						question raised by this appeal is whether 
						notwithstanding the existence of an arbitration clause, 
						a court may on what appellant counsel described as a 
						mere allegation that one party is guilty of fraud 
						refused to enforce it, consequently decline to stay the 
						action.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It necessary for a 
						determination of the question of fraud to revoke the 
						arbitration agreement. But I think the learned trial 
						judge was right, in the circumstances of this case, when 
						he delined to give effect to this arbitration agreement. 
						Why do I say so? The question of fraud is very germane 
						to this dispute which has arisen. The main complaint of 
						the respondents as clearly appears on the face of their 
						pleading is that the appellants have practiced a fraud 
						on them, in that they made certain fraudulent 
						misrepresentations they believed in and which they acted 
						upon to their detriment. In other words they contend 
						that it was these false misrepresentation which induced 
						them to part with the said property. Put differently, it 
						was their case that but for these representations, they 
						would never have leased the property to the appellants. 
						I think a reproduction of the relevant portions of their 
						statement of claim would make the point I have made very 
						clear.</span></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3. In or about 
						September, 1989, the &#8220;Good Shepherd Mission,&#8221; the

						plaintiffs by one &#8220;Brother&#8221; Kofi Appiah-Kubi as a 
						well-off religious organisation registered in Ghana with 
						external connections which engage in religious 
						activities in Accra.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">4. The said Appiah-Kubi

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						Because the plaintiffs were not prepared to lease the 
						premises to a private individual Kofi Appiah-Kubi 
						deceived them to lease it to the &#8220;Good Shepherd Mission&#8221;

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						Good Shepherd is not a registered religious organisation 
						with offices in Accra or anywhere else in Ghana and it 
						is not engaged in any religious activities in Accra. It 
						is reported to be a phmey organisation used to solicit 
						funds from foreign religious organisations for the 
						enjoyment of self proclaimed &#8220;Brothers&#8221; here in Ghana.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is pertinent to note 
						that the appellants concede that for the respondents, it 
						was clearly very important who they leased their 
						property to they limit the fact that respondents were 
						only intent on leasing the property to &#8220;good company or 
						registered organisation&#8221;, not just any organisation or 
						company but respectable ones. I say so because by the 
						paragraph 4 of their statement of defence they 
						unequivocally admitted the paragraph 2 of the 
						respondents claim. This is how the paragraph reads</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;4 Paragraph 2 of the 
						statement of claim is admitted.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have no doubt in my 
						mind that the only way they could have known that the 
						respondents were willing to deal with only a reputable 
						organisation is because they told him so and insisted on 
						it being an essential term of the contract. The 
						appellants denied the charges and particulars of fraud 
						vehemently. Under such circumstances, was it not a 
						proper exercise of the courts discretion when it decided 
						that the arbitration agreement shall cease to have 
						effect to enable the court determine these serious and 
						pertinent issues of fraud. It seems to me from the 
						wording of section 8 of Act 38 that generally speaking 
						the determination of issue of fraud especially when it 
						is central to the dispute, is outside the domain of the 
						arbitrator. It was submitted by Mr. Seta-Clottey counsel 
						for the appellant that the respondent did not 
						sufficiently state the case of fraud as he was required 
						to do under the law, i.e., Section 27(2) of Act. 38. His 
						contention was that he was required to plead with 
						particularity that appellant had indeed been convicted 
						for fraud, and that merely pleading the facts and even 
						particularsing the fraudulent misrepresentations was 
						wholly inadequate and did not meet the requirement of 
						the law. I am afraid I do not agree with these 
						submissions. I think counsel was carried away by the use 
						of the word &#8220;guilty&#8221; as appears in the legislation. But, 
						I do not think the proper construction to be placed on 
						the word &#8220;guilty&#8221; is &#8220;conviction.&#8221; It is a basic rule 
						indeed the first basic rule of construction of statutes 
						that words must be given their literal, ordinary or 
						dictionary meaning in the context of the statute. The 
						law (Section 27(2) makes reference to being &#8220;guilty of 
						fraud&#8221; in relation to agreements entered into by parties 
						and in which additionally it is also provided that 
						future differences which may arise (obviously in 
						relation to the agreement) shall be referred to 
						arbitration. It seems to me then that in the context in 
						which guilty of fraud is being used we are more 
						concerned with the term as is understood by civil courts 
						of justice &#8212; what some describe as civil fraud. I am not 
						to be understood as saying that the Section 27(2) does 
						not also have in its contemption criminal fraud. It is 
						possible and perfectly legitimate to allege a criminal 
						fraud in a civil action. And our Evidence Decree NRCD 
						323 stipulates the degree of proof on such occasions. 
						The relevant section is Section 13 (1) which states:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;13(1) In any civil or 
						criminal action the burden of persuasion as to the 
						commission by a party of a crime which is directly in 
						issue require proof beyond reasonable doubt.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">And therefore it is 
						legitimate to allege the commission of &#8220;criminal fraud&#8221; 
						in a civil action. But, the point I would want to 
						emphasis is that it would be wrong to restrict the 
						&#8220;fraud&#8221; referred to in section 27(2) to only criminal 
						fraud. Indeed not all civil fraud would qualify as 
						criminal fraud and so lead to a conviction. I therefore 
						think it erroneous to urge that a party seeking to have 
						a court suspend an arbitration agreement can only 
						succeed where he averred a conviction of his opponent 
						D.L. Mcdonnel and J.G. Monroe, two distinguished English 
						text writers in their Treaties on the Law of Fraud which 
						is found at page 1 of their invaluable book Kerr on 
						Fraud and Mistake 7th Edition has spelt out what amounts 
						to or constitutes fraud in the eyes of the civil court. 
						They write &#8220;Fraud in the contemplation of a civil court 
						of justice may be said to include properly all acts, 
						omissions, and concealment which involve a breach of 
						legal or equitable duty, trust or confidence, justly 
						resposed sic, and are injurious to another, or by which 
						an undue or unconscient as asic advantage is taken of 
						another. All surprise, trick, cunning dissembling and 
						other unfair way that is used to cheat any one is 
						considered as fraud. Fraud in all cases implies&nbsp; a 
						wilful act on the part of any one whereby another is 
						sought to be deprived, by illegal or inequitable means 
						of what is entitled to.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my view then guilty 
						of fraud does not mean &#8220;convicted of fraud.&#8221; Although I 
						am a proponent of the &#8220;purposive approach&#8221; to the 
						interpretation of statutes and have in a few cases used 
						that to construe legislation, I do think we will be 
						stretching the meaning of &#8220;guilty&#8221; too far if we 
						insisted on interpreting it to mean &#8220;convicted.&#8221; On the 
						contrary, applying the basic or primary rule of 
						interpreting statutes we will find no absurdity. The 
						meaning of the section is plain and unambiguous. The 
						&#8220;guilty&#8221; referred to in the section does not necessarily 
						mean conviction. I would interpret it to mean where any 
						one is &#8220;accused&#8221; of or blamed or held for fraud or where 
						an allegation of fraud is made against another. It does 
						follow that when the respondent fully pleaded the fraud 
						in the various paragraphs I have referred to and set out 
						the particulars of fraud, they had done all that was 
						required of them to raise on their pleadings a prima 
						facie case of fraud. Put in other words, they have by 
						their pleadings raised a serious case of fraud.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Consequently the 
						learned trial judge was right when he concluded that on 
						the particulars of facts of the case, the arbitration 
						agreement cease to have effect to enable the court 
						determine the issesic of fraud.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The application for an 
						order for stay or proceedings was undoubtedly brought 
						under section 8 of Act 38. under that section it was not 
						merely enough for the appellant to raise the existence 
						of the agreement and expect a reference of the matter to 
						arbitration. The law requires that to succeed in 
						containing the relevant orders, the applicant must also 
						demonstrate that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1) at the time when 
						the proceedings were commenced he was and</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) even up to the date 
						of the application he is still ready and willing to do 
						all things necessary to the proper conduct of the 
						arbitration.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is only then that if 
						the court is satisfied that there is no sufficient 
						reason why the matter ought not to go to arbitration, 
						exercise its discretion in applicant&#8217;s favour. I have 
						already quoted the section 8 in extenso.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have examined the 
						affidavit in support of the motion for stay of 
						proceedings. I find nothing showing the appellants 
						readnesssic and willfulness to co-operate towards the 
						proper conduct of the arbitration. On this ground alone, 
						the learned judge was right in refusing the application. 
						But even more importantly the court thought the issue of 
						fraud was so critical it does justify a refusal. In 
						other words it was a sufficiently good enough reason why 
						the court ought to assume jurisdiction. In the 
						circumstances, I think the order of refusal was right 
						and ought not to be interfered with it.</span></p>

						<span style="font-family: Arial">JUSTICE OF APPEAL</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">JUDGMENT OF BROBBEY, J 
						.A.:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The respondents owned a 
						plot of land at Christiansborg, Accra. It had an 
						uncompleted building on it. The land and the building 
						will hereinafter be referred to as the disputed 
						property. According to their pleadings, they decided to 
						lease it to a company or a registered organisation. The 
						appellant, represented by one Reverend &#8220;Brother&#8221; Kofi 
						Appiah-Kubi entered into a written agreement with the 
						appellants for the lease of the property.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Not long after the 
						lease agreement has been executed, a dispute arose. In 
						sum, the dispute was that Appiah-Kubi had perpetrated 
						fraud on the respondents by representing that the Good 
						Shepherd Mission was a registered religious body when in 
						truth and in fact it had not been registered at all.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The respondents 
						therefore sued the appellants in the Circuit court of 
						recovery of possession, damages for deceit, mesne 
						profits and &quot;any other reliefs disclosed by the 
						pleadings.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">While the suit was 
						pending, the appellant filed a motion at the trial court 
						to stay proceedings pending in that court. His main 
						reason for the motion was that the written agreement 
						contained an ouster clause which provided that any 
						dispute between the parties concerning the leasehold 
						should first be referred to an arbitrator before it 
						could be pursued in a court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellant therefore 
						contended that until the parties had exhausted their 
						remedies at arbitration, the action could not proceed in 
						the Circuit Court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The respondents however 
						contended that since they had alleged fraud on the part 
						of the appellant, the ouster clause could not be invoked 
						to stay proceedings in the trial court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After arguments before 
						the trial Circuit Court, the trial Judge upheld the 
						counterclaim of the respondent. The appellants then 
						appealed against that ruling.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this court, the 
						appellant argued only one ground which was that the 
						trial Judge erred in refusing the stay on account of 
						fraud because the law required that that kind of fraud 
						should be established proved as in a criminal case but 
						that was not done. He contended that mere allegation of 
						fraud was not enough. In his view the appellant should 
						have been proved guilty of fraud by a Court of Competent 
						Jurisdiction before fraud could be used to avoid the 
						effect of an arbitration. For his counterclaim, counsel 
						relied on the Arbitration Act, 1961 (Act 38) Section&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						27(2) and Khoury v. Khoury (1962) 1 GLR 98. Act. 38, 
						Section 27(2) provides that</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;(2) Where an agreement 
						between any parties provides that differences which may 
						arise in the future between them shall be referred to 
						arbitration, and a difference which so arises involves 
						the question whether any such party has been guilty of 
						fraud, the court shall, so far as may be necessary to 
						enable that question to be determined by the Court, have 
						power to order that the agreement shall cease to have 
						effect and power to give leave to revoke the authority 
						of any arbitrator or umpire appointed by or by virtue of 
						the agreement.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The argument of counsel 
						for the appellant was that the use of the word &#8220;guilty&#8221; 
						in the subsection implied that the person accused of 
						fraud should be proved to have been actually convicted 
						by a Court of Competent jurisdiction before Section 
						27(2) could be applied. That, with respect, could not be 
						correct. To uphold that interpretation would amount to 
						imputing into Section 27(2) the word &#8220;proven&#8221; or 
						&#8220;established&#8221;. That would change the entire meaning of 
						that Section 27(2).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is obvious from the 
						most cursory reading of Section 27(2) that it does not 
						contain the condition imposed by counsel for the 
						appellant. At no part of Act 38, Section 27(2) is it 
						stated that fraud should be proved. If the legislature 
						intended that fraud should be established or proved. 
						Section 27(2) would have stated so in no uncertain 
						terms.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On a plain reading of 
						Act 38, Section 27(2) does not specify the standard of 
						proof when fraud is alleged to oust the terms of 
						arbitration. It is significant to point out that counsel 
						for the appellant had no authority for his proposition. 
						Khoury v. Khoury (1962) 1 GLR 95, which he relied upon 
						is distinguishable from the instant case on two grounds; 
						firstly, the claim in that case was very comprehensive 
						and all-embracing. It covered all disputes whatsoever 
						arising. Secondly it did not deal with fraud at all 
						which is the fundamental issue in this case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The position at Common 
						Law is that the person alleging fraud to oust the 
						jurisdiction of arbitration should be able to establish 
						a prima facie case of fraud: See Russell on Arbitration, 
						7th Edition at page 84. In that book Russell v. Russell 
						(1880) 14 Ch.D. 471 was cited to support that 
						proposition. In that case an application to stay court 
						proceedings to enable parties resort to arbitration 
						failed because the applicant did not establish prima 
						facie case of fraud.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">By analogy it can be 
						said that the same standard may be applied in 
						considering the standard required in Section 27(2).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This reasoning is 
						buttressed further by the fact that the wording in Act 
						38, Section 27(2) is almost the same as the wording of 
						the English equivalent of the Arbitration Act, 1950 (14 
						Geo. 6, C. 27), Section 24(2). That section 24(2) reads 
						as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;24(2) where in 
						agreement between any parties provides that disputes 
						which may arise in the future between them shall be 
						referred to arbitration, and a dispute which so arises 
						involves the question whether any such party has been 
						guilty of fraud, the High Court shall, so far as may be 
						necessary to enable that question to be determined by 
						the High Court, have power to order that the agreement 
						shall cease to have effect and power to give leave to 
						revoke the authority of any arbitrator or umpire 
						appointed by or by virtue of the agreement.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the editorial note 
						to this Section 24(6) in Halsbury&#8217;s Statutes, 4th 
						edition, volume 2, page 600 it is stated that:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;No exhaustive 
						definition of the term &#8220;fraud&#8221; can be given and the 
						court has never ventured to lay down any general 
						proposition of what constitutes fraud. Generally it 
						connotes an element of deliberate deception as opposed 
						to honest mistake.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The case of R.Y. 
						Williams (1953) 2 QB 600 was then cited to support that 
						proposition. That case actually decided that the acts 
						complained of as constituting fraud should be 
						&#8220;deliberate and intentional.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It follows from the 
						foregoing that in the instant case for the purpose of 
						determining whether or not the court action should be 
						allowed to proceed because of the allegation of fraud, 
						that fraud does not have to be proved beyond reasonable 
						doubt. All that is required at this stage is to 
						establish a prima facie case of fraud.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The argument of counsel 
						for the appellant may apply where evidence has been 
						taken already and the court has to decide on whether or 
						not fraud has been established. In that event, fraud, 
						being a criminal allegation, may be proved beyond 
						reasonable doubt even though it is alleged in a civil 
						case. This is the law as stated in the Evidence Decree, 
						1978, NRCD 323, Section 13(1).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The question to be 
						resolved in this appeal is whether or not a prima facie 
						case of fraud was made out by the respondents.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At the trial court, the 
						respondents insisted as per their pleadings and 
						affidavits and arguments that they intended to lease the 
						property to a registered company or orgnisation. They 
						averred that the Good Shepherd Mission was not a 
						registered organisation. They contended further that 
						Appiah-Kubi deceived them into believing that the 
						appellant was a registered organisation. As at the time 
						of hearing this appeal all that the appellant had done 
						was to oppose the averment by orally alleging that the 
						appellant was a registered organisation. If it was, 
						what&nbsp; prevented it or its solicitor&#8217;s from exhibiting 
						its registration certificate or disclosing particulars 
						of the registration so as to enable the respondent to 
						verify from the appropriate authority whether or not it 
						had been officially registered? No reason was disclosed 
						on the face of the record by the appellant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The most crucial point 
						is that the respondents were alleging the appellant, 
						i.e. that the Good Shepherd Mission was not a registered 
						Organisation.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellant was 
						asserting that it was a registered organisation. The 
						onus was obviously placed on the appellant to have 
						disclosed particulars of their alleged registration. 
						This is clearly borne out by the Evidence Decree, 1975 
						(NRCD 323) section 14 which provides that</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Except as otherwise 
						provided by law, unless and until it is shifted a party 
						has the burden of persuasion as to each fact the 
						existence or non-existence of which is essential to the 
						claim or defence he is asserting.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The marginal note to 
						this Section states that the Section covers &#8220;allocation 
						of burden of persuation.&#8221; By this Section it was 
						apparent that it was the appellant who had the duty to 
						have adduced evidence essential to sustain its assertion 
						that it was a registered organisation.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This view is further 
						supported by Section 11(1) of NRCD 323 which also 
						provides that</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;For the purposes of 
						this Decree, the burden of producing evidence means the 
						obligation of a party to introduce sufficient evidence 
						to avoid a ruling against him on the issue.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The marginal note on 
						this subsection also states that the section covers the 
						definition of the burden of producing evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Quite obviously, if the 
						appellant in the instant case failed to adduce evidence, 
						the ruling that is was not a registered organisation 
						would be given against it. That is the more reason why 
						it was duty bound to have described particulars on its 
						registration. The fact that no single information about 
						its registration can be seen on the entire appeal record 
						obviously leads to the inescapable conclusion that on 
						the face of the pleadings, affidavits, arguments before 
						the trial court and indeed on the face of the appeal 
						record before this court, there is nothing to show that 
						the appellant is a registered organisation.</span></p>
