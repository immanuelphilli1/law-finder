						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 
						Plaintiff/Respondent is the administrator of the estate 
						of his late mother Esther Akuorkor Quaye owner of House 
						No. B737/7 Abossey Okai Accra.&nbsp; The defendant runs a 
						nightclub known as &#8220;SUNKWA NIGHT CLUB in the said House 
						No. B 737/7.&nbsp; The Plaintiff/Respondent (who will 
						hereinafter be simply referred to as the plaintiff) is 
						one of the sons of Esther Akuorkor Quaye (deceased).&nbsp; 
						The Plaintiff&#8217;s case was that the Defendant/Appellant 
						rented a room in the said house No. B737/7 and 
						subsequently took a lease of a vacant space in front of 
						the building at a monthly rent of £5.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There arose a 
						controversy between the parties as to how the 
						Defendant/Appellant&nbsp; (who will hereafter be called the 
						Defendant) came to occupy the premises and what interest 
						if any he had in the property.&nbsp; The Plaintiff therefore 
						issued a Writ asking for the following reliefs:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a)&nbsp; An Order that 
						H/No. B737/7 Kaneshie was redeemed on the 31st March 
						1975.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b)&nbsp; Payment of Mesne 
						profits</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c)&nbsp; Ejectment of 
						Defendant from the said house.&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Defendant also 
						counter-claimed for the following reliefs:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a)&nbsp; An Order of the 
						Court that the Plaintiff should execute a deed of 
						conveyance in affirmation of the afore-mentioned 
						agreement of 1968.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b)&nbsp; An account of the 
						amount of compensation received from the Ghana Highways 
						Authority by the Plaintiff in trust for the Defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c)&nbsp; Interest of 10 
						percent on the amount found due to the defendant from 
						the date of receive of the compensation by the Plaintiff 
						to date of judgment or payment thereof to the Defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Defendant lost the 
						suit and being aggrieved and dissatisfied he has 
						appealed to this High Court dated 7th July 1989 on two 
						grounds namely:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a)&nbsp; The&nbsp; Honourable 
						High Court Judge erred in law.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b)&nbsp; The judgment was 
						against the weight of the evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is evident from the 
						record of proceedings that the Plaintiff sued per his 
						Lawful Attorney one Francis Sogah a younger brother of 
						Plaintiff.&nbsp; In arguing ground (b) of the two grounds 
						learned counsel for the Defendant submitted that the 
						trial judge ignored or played down every material 
						evidence in favour of the Defendant.&nbsp; He said that 
						everything the trial judge relied on to give judgment 
						against the Defendant was as confessed by the Lawful 
						Attorney what was passed on to him.&nbsp; For example the 
						trial judge ignored an important confession made by 
						Francis Sogah, the lawful attorney which should have 
						rendered the evidence in favour of the Plaintiff 
						unreliable. The confession learned counsel referred were 
						the answers the lawful attorney gave under&nbsp; 
						cross-examination.&nbsp; Some are:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp; &#8220;All you know were 
						passed on to you.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A. &nbsp;&nbsp;That is so.&nbsp; My 
						brother till </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not to your 
						personal knowledge </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp;&nbsp; My brother told me 
						I did not see it.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He said that in the 
						light of the above cross-examination and other hearsay 
						evidence given by the Plaintiff&#8217;s attorney, learned 
						counsel concluded that everything the trial judge relied 
						on to give judgment against the Defendant was as 
						confessed by the Lawful Attorney what was passed on to 
						the Plaintiff and witnesses.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In his reaction to the 
						submission of counsel for the Defendant counsel for the 
						plaintiff recounted that the Plaintiff was represented 
						by an Attorney in the matter.&nbsp; This was because the 
						Plaintiff had a stroke so his speech was seriously 
						impaired.&nbsp; He submitted that much of the case of the 
						Defendant is based on the Supposition that the Attorney 
						was not present when certain acts and matters took place 
						and so the court should ignore the evidence completely. 
						This is why counsel for the Defendant had referred to as 
						&#8220;CONFESSIONS.&#8221; Learned counsel argued that instead of 
						asking the Court to ignore the attorneys evidence, the 
						Defendant should have adduced evidence to rebut the 
						evidence on oath of the Attorney which in law amounted 
						to statement on oath by the Plaintiff himself.&nbsp; Counsel 
						for the Plaintiff contended that the learned trial judge 
						accepted the evidence on oath of the Attorney which was 
						never shaken under cross-examination and which appeared 
						to be the most probable of the conflicting, versions of 
						the events transpired between Defendant and Plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In paragraph 3, 4 and 
						5th of the statement of claim the Plaintiff pleaded as 
						follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220; 3 That in or about 
						1968 Plaintiff agreed with the Defendant that in 
						consideration for repayment of a mortgage loan of about 
						¢2,610.00 to the Ghana Commercial Bank and the expenses 
						incurred in developing an area on the properly to the 
						tune of ¢4,010 including interest Defendant held the 
						aforementioned property as security for a period of 6 
						years 11 months.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(4)&nbsp; That the sums 
						mentioned supra are to be redeemed by defendant by 
						collecting a monthly rent of ¢90.00 beginning 1st March 
						1968 to the 31st March 1975 when the security shall be 
						redeemed and Defendant to hand over the property to the 
						Plaintiff </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(5) That Plaintiff says 
						that the legal date of transfer of the property from 
						Defendant to Plaintiff has passed but Defendant has 
						refused and or failed to vacate the premises&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In his evidence the 
						Defendant gave quite a contrary account of the 
						transaction that took place between him and the 
						Plaintiff. He testified that sometime in 1968 in 
						consideration of £500.00, the Plaintiff granted licence 
						to him to construct a block building on part of the land 
						on which house No. 737/3&nbsp; Abossey Okai stands for use as 
						building premises, on condition that the defendant would 
						leave the building to the plaintiff when the defendant 
						finally decided to go to his home-town.&nbsp; He said after 
						he had constructed 3-room building on the said part of 
						the land, the whole property was attached towards the 
						execution of a fife in satisfaction of a Bank mortgage 
						loan. According to him as a result of this revelation, 
						he immediately demanded from the plaintiff the refund of 
						the £500 and cost of the construction of 3-room 
						building.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendant&#8217;s 
						evidence was that the plaintiff then entered into a 
						fresh agreement with him the terms of which are that the 
						defendant should negotiate with the Bank and pay off the 
						loan with interest, that the defendant, should take 
						possession of the plaintiff&#8217;s house No. 737/3 Abossey 
						Okai on the land to manage and help the repayment of the 
						loan. He said after the repayment of the loan the 
						plaintiff failed to execute a conveyance or deed to 
						evidence defendant&#8217;s title to the land whereof the 
						plaintiff originally granted licence to him.&nbsp; In other 
						words the plaintiff failed to execute a conveyance in 
						his favour to turn the said licence of 1968 into 
						absolute sale of the said part of the land. Dr. Sogah, a 
						brother of the Plaintiff gave evidence substantially the 
						same as that of the Plaintiff.&nbsp; He testified that when 
						they were confronted with the attachment of the house to 
						pay a Bank mortgage loan they decided to get some one to 
						pay off the loan and then take the house and use the 
						rent to defray or offset the payment. He said at that 
						juncture the defendant came forward and said he could 
						help them to pay the loan so that they could use the 
						monthly rents he was to pay them to offset the payment.&nbsp; 
						The plaintiff subsequently found a lawyer who drew out 
						an agreement. They signed their portion and gave a copy 
						to the defendant to study.&nbsp; That up to date the 
						defendant has not signed the agreement.&nbsp; Dr. Sogah went 
						on to say that the contents of the agreement was however 
						read and explained to the defendant as he said he was 
						illiterate and could not read.&nbsp; The amount of the loan 
						was £3,713 and the defendant agreed to pay rent of £45 
						per month. After he had agreed to this, according to the 
						witness, they sealed the agreement with schnapps. This 
						was in 1968. the agreement was tendered in evidence and 
						marked as Exhibit A.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The evidence was clear 
						that all the tenants in the building were ejected and 
						the whole premises given to the defendant.&nbsp; The 
						defendant himself said the plaintiff handed over the 
						main building to him to manage so that he collected the 
						rent and use it to pay the Bank loan.&nbsp; The defendant 
						testified that he used the building to run his business 
						and got money to pay the loan.&nbsp; When cross-examined as 
						to how much he was paying to the bank he replied that he 
						could not tell off hand as it happened a long time ago.&nbsp; 
						He also said as follows under cross-examination.&nbsp; </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q. &#8220; (i)&nbsp;&nbsp; some time 
						you paid ¢30,000 per month to the bank.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot 
						remember. I paid the whole debt.&nbsp; That is what I know.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Under further 
						cross-examination the defendant gave the following 
						answers:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp; If you calculate 
						from 1967 by 1975 they would have settled this amount 
						owed you.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp; There was no 
						agreement.&nbsp; They said I should pay off the loan owed so 
						that they would convey the land on which I had my 
						building to me.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Under further 
						cross-examination the defendant said:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Q.&nbsp; They never agreed 
						to give you a plot of land, for the land itself is only 
						one plot</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp;&nbsp; They did promise 
						where I use.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Undoubtedly the 
						evidence presented before the trial judge revealed that 
						there were two conflicting claims and her duty as she 
						saw it was to determine which of the two rival claims 
						was the truth.&nbsp; She eventually opted for the plaintiffs.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In her judgment the 
						trial judge gave the following reasons to justify her 
						preference to the plaintiff&#8217;s case.&nbsp; She said &#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.&nbsp; Why 
						I think defendant cannot be speaking the truth.&nbsp; He 
						plainly confesses under cross-examination that he does 
						not know the size of the land in dispute i.e. the land 
						he claims the plaintiff promised to convey to him. If he 
						did not know, how was he in a position to assess the 
						value and more particularly to know whether or not the 
						plaintiffs were not demanding too much by asking him to 
						settle the debt, the outstanding and future rates on the 
						premises.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Another reason why 
						learned judge preferred the plaintiff&#8217;s case was that 
						&#8220;In any case why was the defendant not paying rents to 
						the plaintiff.&#8221;&nbsp; If the arrangement was to pay off the 
						debt and the land transferred to him?&nbsp; We do clearly see 
						from these circumstances that he occupied the premises 
						on the understanding that the rents payable to the 
						plaintiffs was to be used to defray the debt he had 
						settled on their behalf.&nbsp; This can be the only logical 
						explanation for the ejectment of the original tenants 
						particularly his occupation of the whole premises and 
						the non-payment of rents whatsoever to the owners of the 
						property.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A reading of the 
						record, shows that there are inconsistencies in the 
						defendant&#8217;s pleadings and the evidence adduced. On one 
						hand the defendant is claiming that there was a verbal 
						promise for an outright sale of the frontage of the 
						house to him, on the other hand he claims he was given 
						the assurance that he would be permitted to have the 
						place until he leaves same when he decided to go home 
						for good.&nbsp; He claimed that the consideration for this 
						was £500 he paid to plaintiff; no receipt was tendered 
						to support this.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I am satisfied that the 
						learned trial Judge made a critical analysis of the 
						evidence in the light of the conflicting or rival claims 
						before her.&nbsp; I hold that the decision the learned judge 
						arrived at is correct and supported by the evidence.&nbsp; It 
						should not be disturbed without clear proof that it is 
						wrong and I fail to find proof, in the record that it is 
						wrong.&nbsp; For these reasons the appeal is dismissed.</span></p>
