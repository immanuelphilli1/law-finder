												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is an appeal from the 
												judgment of the High Court, 
												Accra delivered on 15th 
												December, 1997 in favour of the 
												respondent herein on an 
												application by the latter for 
												certain reliefs in the nature of 
												prerogative orders, to be 
												precise for the orders of 
												certiorari and mandamus directed 
												against the Electoral 
												Commission. The circumstances 
												that led to the institution of 
												the proceedings before the High 
												Court, as I was able to cull 
												from the introductory parts of 
												the written statements of 
												Counsel on both sides could be 
												briefly related. In the run-up 
												of the Presidential and 
												Parliamentary elections held on 
												7th December 1996, the second 
												since the restoration of 
												constitutional and multi-party 
												administration in this country 
												in the post 31st December 1981 
												revolutionary era, the parties 
												in this case, each representing 
												his political party contested 
												the elections to wrest the 
												parliamentary seat of the 
												Ayawaso-West-Wuogon constituency 
												of the Greater Accra Region of 
												Ghana. Unlike other 
												constituencies in the country 
												where some losers even 
												congratulated their opponent 
												winners in the aftermath of the 
												declaration of the final results 
												of the electioneering and voting 
												exercise, the Ayawaso 
												West-Wuogon constituency became 
												the sore point for fierce legal 
												tussles in the courts one of 
												them culminating in this appeal. 
												The respondent who lost the 
												election instituted an action in 
												the High Court, Accra 
												challenging the results on the 
												grounds, claimed by him, that 
												there had been an error or 
												omission in the counting of the 
												votes cast and this had 
												consequently prejudiced his 
												chance of winning the seat. 
												Apparently upon legal advise, he 
												discontinued the action which he 
												initially commenced by the 
												procedure of issuing an ordinary 
												writ of summons with a view to 
												filing an election petition in 
												the High Court, Accra which he 
												in fact did. Unfortunately for 
												the respondent, The 
												Representation Of The People 
												Law, 1992 (PNDCL 284) turned out 
												to be the bane of his political 
												ambitions; for Gbadegbe J (as he 
												then was) peremptorily dismissed 
												the petition on the grounds that 
												the proceeding was 
												statute-barred. The reason 
												advanced by the learned trial 
												judge was that the respondent 
												did not fulfil the mandatory 
												statutory requirement of 
												presenting the petition within a 
												period of 21 days prescribed by 
												the relevant enactment, namely, 
												the Representation of the People 
												Decree (supra). An appeal 
												against that ruling to the Court 
												of Appeal was dismissed and he 
												filed yet another appeal with 
												the Supreme Court, which is 
												still pending. As if unsure of 
												the prospects of the appeal 
												succeeding, or for some other 
												reason peculiarly within his 
												knowledge, the respondent, while 
												the appeal to the Supreme Court 
												was pending determination, again 
												mounted a fresh action taking 
												its inspirational sustenance 
												from certain provisions of the 
												Constitution, 1992 subsumed 
												under what he called fundamental 
												human rights. His complaint was 
												that his constitutional rights 
												as a parliamentary candidate had 
												been violated in the 
												electioneering and voting 
												exercise because the Electoral 
												Commission had omitted to count 
												certain votes cast for him. 
												There was a poignant allegation 
												that some votes cast for the 
												respondent had been wrongly 
												credited to candidates of other 
												political parties. The remedies 
												sought by the respondent in his 
												renewed bid to vindicate his 
												stand were the stereotype 
												prerogative orders, the most 
												potent constitutional and 
												judicial weapon only reserved 
												for the High Court and the 
												Supreme Court under the 
												Constitution, 1992, the former 
												over all inferior courts, 
												tribunals and other corporate 
												bodies or individuals, and the 
												latter over institutions of that 
												character or individuals 
												including even the High Court, 
												to quash their decisions or acts 
												or to compel them to do their 
												perceived lawful duties and 
												acts. This procedure operates 
												through the medium of 
												certiorari, mandamus and quo 
												warranto. The respondent applied 
												to the High Court to cause all 
												the election results to be 
												brought to court to be quashed 
												and to order the Electoral 
												Commissioner to assemble all the 
												votes cast, recount them and 
												declare the winner.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The learned trial judge granted 
												all the reliefs sought by the 
												respondent and made the 
												necessary orders as prayed. 
												Against this judgment or ruling 
												an appeal has been lodged by the 
												candidate who was declared 
												winner (in this appeal referred 
												to simply as the appellant) on 
												three main grounds: &#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) The learned trial judge 
												erred in granting orders of 
												certiorari and mandamus when an 
												appeal had been filed against 
												the dismissal of the petition 
												filed on behalf of the applicant 
												(here substitute respondent).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) The learned trial judge 
												erred in holding that certiorari 
												and mandamus could be granted in 
												respect of breaches under the 
												Public Elections Regulations 
												1996 (CI 15).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3) The learned trial judge 
												erred when she held that the 
												applicable law was not PNDCL 
												284, but CI. 15.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I shall first deal with ground 
												one. My understanding of this 
												ground of appeal or, if I may 
												say so, the kernel or the thrust 
												of the submission against the 
												background of this case is 
												simply this: That it was not 
												open to the learned trial High 
												Court Judge to assume fresh 
												jurisdiction under the cloak of 
												an application for the 
												prerogative orders of certiorari 
												and mandamus in respect of a 
												disputed election result for 
												which an election petition had 
												previously been filed before the 
												High Court differently 
												constituted and the court had 
												dismissed it and an appeal 
												against the dismissal was still 
												pending before the Supreme 
												Court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In his written submission of 
												case, Counsel for the appellant 
												herein narrated an important 
												event which occurred at the 
												commencement of the proceedings 
												in this case. According to him, 
												a preliminary objection was 
												raised as to the juridical 
												competence of the present 
												action; that since there was an 
												appeal pending in respect of the 
												petition which in his view was 
												the same matter as the 
												application for certiorari and 
												mandamus, the court should not 
												allow the applicant to move the 
												application and should dismiss 
												same. For the avoidance of doubt 
												I will reproduce what Counsel 
												relates: &#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The High Court Judge adjourned 
												the matter for ruling on the 
												preliminary objection to the 
												30/10/97 (see page 196 of the 
												record). On the said date Her 
												Lordship invited Counsel in the 
												suit to her chambers and 
												informed Counsel that she had 
												decided to incorporate the 
												ruling of the preliminary 
												objection in the main ruling of 
												the case. She adjourned the suit 
												for the hearing of the 
												substantive application. My 
												Lords, we filed an appeal 
												against Her Lordship's refusal 
												to deliver her ruling and filed 
												a motion for a stay of 
												proceedings pending the hearing 
												of the motion (see page 197-202 
												of the record). The learned 
												trial judge refused to hear the 
												application and delivered her 
												ruling granting all the reliefs 
												sought by the applicant (see 
												page 25 - 287 of the record of 
												appeal)&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel for the respondent 
												admitted these facts at page 7 
												of his written statement of case 
												and in fairness to all parties I 
												shall reproduce his version as 
												follows: &#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;On the 29th October 1997 the 
												trial judge called the parties 
												and their counsel into chambers 
												and informed them that she had 
												decided in the interests of 
												justice, to hear the substantive 
												application and deliver her 
												ruling on the preliminary 
												objection together with her 
												ruling on the substantive 
												application. All Counsel in the 
												chambers agreed to this course 
												of action. However, the 
												appellant's counsel filed an 
												appeal against it on the same 
												day at 12.44 pm and filed an 
												application for a stay of 
												proceedings the same day at 
												1.00pm. The application was 
												brought to the notice of the 
												learned trial judge on 30th 
												October 1997 when she decided to 
												go on nevertheless with the 
												hearing on the substantive 
												application which was duly 
												argued by both sides on that 
												date 31st October and 3rd 
												November when the judge 
												adjourned the matter for 
												ruling.&#8221; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Before I make my comments about 
												the propriety or otherwise of 
												the procedure which the learned 
												trial judge adopted, I wish to 
												express my unqualified 
												admiration for the candour and 
												honesty which both Counsel have 
												shown to the court in respect of 
												the facts they each presented in 
												their written statements. Having 
												said that, I wish to observe 
												that if what has been related by 
												Counsel as certified on the 
												record is anything to go by, 
												then I would unhesitatingly say 
												that the learned trial judge was 
												guilty of demonstrable 
												impatience which could have the 
												potential of prejudicing the 
												administration of justice, which 
												is avowedly an inherently slow 
												process but the surest guarantee 
												to liberty. The learned judge 
												breached a fundamental rule of 
												procedure relating to 
												preliminary objections in law. 
												The real essence of the 
												preliminary objection was to 
												challenge the juridical 
												competence of the High Court to 
												entertain the application for 
												certiorari and mandamus and it 
												was wrong for the trial judge 
												not to have made a ruling on the 
												important question of 
												jurisdiction. If there was such 
												an agreement by Counsel or even 
												the parties to the procedure 
												which from all indications the 
												learned trial judge had in her 
												sleeves then, I would mince no 
												words in saying that it was most 
												unfortunate because it tended to 
												threaten and prejudice the 
												fundamental rationes of the 
												jurisdiction of a court to hear 
												or determine any cause or 
												matter. In the case of Quist v. 
												Kwantreng and others Ollennu J 
												(as he then was) expressed 
												disgust with this procedure and 
												I would just quote holdings (6) 
												and (7) of that case to 
												demonstrate: &#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;(6) parties cannot by consent 
												or by acquiescence confer 
												jurisdiction on a court where it 
												has none otherwise.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(7) an objection to jurisdiction 
												can be taken at any time; it may 
												even be raised for the first 
												time on a second appeal&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial judge is seemed to 
												know the law and therefore even 
												if Counsel or the parties did 
												anything contrary to law it was 
												her prime responsibility as the 
												protector of the law to have 
												upheld same and to do the right 
												thing. She should have given her 
												ruling on the preliminary 
												objection. Her failure to do so 
												seriously prejudiced the 
												proceedings and violated the 
												very foundation of justice as 
												practised in our courts. In the 
												recent case of Michael Yeboah v. 
												J.H. Mensah Writ No. 2/97 dated 
												6th June, 1998 Supreme Court, 
												unreported, it came to light 
												that The Honourable J.H. Mensah 
												M.P. for Sunyani East had 
												appeared before the High Court, 
												Sunyani on the 12th May 1997 in 
												connection with an election 
												petition filed by some 
												applicants to unseat him as the 
												elected member of Parliament for 
												Sunyani East constituency on 
												certain grounds stated in the 
												petition and that the High 
												Court, Sunyani had dismissed the 
												said petition on the ground that 
												it&nbsp; had not been filed within 
												the statutory period of 21 days. 
												Expressing his legal opinion on 
												the legal effect of the 
												dismissal of the said election 
												petition, His Lordship 
												Hayfron-Benjamin JSC (presiding) 
												said and I quote:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220; it will be seen from the 
												provisions of section 19 of 
												PNDCL 284 that by that decision 
												of the High Court, Sunyani, on 
												the 12th May 1997 the defendant 
												whose election has been 
												questioned has been duly 
												elected, such a decision as was 
												given by the High Court was in 
												my respectful opinion a judgment 
												in rem and operated to conclude 
												the matter for all time unless 
												it was set aside on appeal&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the case of Kariyavoulas and 
												Another v. Osei (1982-83) GLR 1 
												658 at p 665, I expressed an 
												opinion on the meaning of 
												judgment in rem as follows: &#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;There are two types of 
												judgements to be considered when 
												determining issues of res 
												judicata; judgments in rem and 
												judgments in personem. A 
												judgment in rem settles all 
												issues as to the status of the 
												persons or things and the 
												disposition of them or the 
												proceeds of their sale and it 
												operates as estoppel per rem 
												judicatem against all persons 
												within the jurisdiction of the 
												court pronouncing it, whereas a 
												judgment in personam is one 
												inter parties and raises an 
												estoppel against the parties to 
												the suit: see Halsbury&#8217;s Laws of 
												England, 3rd Edition, Vol. 15 at 
												pages 191 - 195; Amoah v. Poku 
												(1965) GLR 155 SC&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Again in the case of Bassil v. 
												Honger (1954) 14 WACA p 569 at 
												p. 572 Coussey JA (as he then 
												was) said: &#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The plea of res judicata 
												prohibits the court from 
												enquiring into a matter already 
												adjudicated upon. It ousts the 
												jurisdiction of the court&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The fact that Gbadegbe J (as he 
												then was did not take evidence 
												in the petition does not detract 
												from the status of the 
												proceeding before him as a 
												judgment in rem. I will 
												elaborate this point soon when I 
												come to deal with the law 
												relating to statutes of 
												limitation. Suffice it to say at 
												this stage that I respectfully 
												agree with the opinion of 
												Hayfron-Benjamin JSC (as he then 
												was) quoted above and, of 
												course, as explained in the 
												Kariyavous case (supra) and hold 
												that Gbadegbe J&#8217;s dismissal of 
												the respondent's election 
												petition constituted a judgment 
												in rem. It is noteworthy that by 
												paragraphs 8 and 9 of her 
												affidavit in opposition to the 
												motion for certiorari and 
												mandamus, the appellant herein 
												stated as follows: &#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;(8) I have been advised and 
												verily believe same to be true 
												that this action being an action 
												to question an electoral result 
												can only be commenced in court 
												by way of an election petition 
												and not by prerogative writs.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(9) That the applicant knowing 
												the position as stated in 
												paragraph 8 herein filed a 
												petition in this Honourable 
												Court which was subsequently 
												dismissed by the court. The 
												applicant cannot and should not 
												be allowed to circumvent and 
												render the decision of this 
												court nugatory by seeking the 
												remedies of certiorari and 
												mandamus while pursuing an 
												appeal in the same matter.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The depositions by the appellant 
												clearly constitute a plea of 
												estoppel and the limitation of 
												actions which by the rules must 
												be pleaded. These facts could 
												not and in fact were not 
												disputed and yet the learned 
												trial judge thought that she had 
												jurisdiction to entertain the 
												application for the prerogative 
												orders of certiorari and 
												mandamus.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It has been argued that Gbadegbe 
												J did not go into the merits of 
												the election petition and so the 
												mere dismissal of the action on 
												the ground that it was 
												statute-barred was no ground for 
												not entertaining the present 
												application for the prerogative 
												orders. My view on this 
												submission has already been 
												stated above and, as I promised, 
												I now proceed to strengthen that 
												view by a brief exposition of 
												the law relating to statutes of 
												limitation. In the case of Dede 
												v. Tetteh and Others (1976) 1 
												GLR p 49 at p 53 
												Griffiths-Randolf J (as he then 
												was) said: &#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;It is pertinent to say that 
												statutes of limitation are 
												intended to keep a tardy 
												plaintiff out of court, and thus 
												free the defendant from being 
												harassed with stale claims, the 
												maxim being &#8220;vigilantibus et non 
												dormientibus, jura subveninut 
												(i.e. the laws give help to 
												those who are watchful and not 
												to those who go to sleep) and 
												that on the principle of 
												&#8216;interest republicae ut sit 
												finis litium (i.e. it concerns 
												the state that lawsuits be not 
												protracted) fixed periods of 
												time within which actions must 
												be brought or proceedings taken 
												are prescribed in various 
												statutes of limitation&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												And in tune with this rule of 
												law, I may refer also to the 
												memorandum to the Limitation 
												Decree, 1972 (NRCD 54) where it 
												is stated: &#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The limitation of actions is a 
												rule of public policy which 
												provides for the automatic 
												termination of litigation after 
												a fixed period of time. After 
												this statutory period, a 
												person&#8217;s right of action is 
												barred and sometimes his title 
												is extinguished.&#8221; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In his written statement of case 
												Counsel for the respondent is 
												recorded to have given the 
												following graphic but pungent 
												account (see pages 3 to 4 
												thereof): &#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;(11) On 19th January 1997 the 
												respondent filed an election 
												petition in the High Court 
												Accra, challenging the results 
												in the Ayawaso West-Wuogon 
												constituency but this petition 
												was on the 3rd day of May 1997 
												struck out by Gbadegbe J (as he 
												then was) on the ground that the 
												statutory requirement of the 
												provision of financial security 
												had not been complied with 
												within the statutory period with 
												the result that the complaint of 
												the respondent in the said 
												petition that votes actually 
												cast for him at the Mpehuasem 
												and Mensa-Wood polling stations 
												had been wrongly credited to 
												other candidates while votes 
												cast for other candidates had 
												been erroneously credited to him 
												thereby robbing him of victory 
												at the said election was not 
												enquired into at all.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(12) it would be observed that 
												the election petition which was 
												struck out by Gbadegbe J (as he 
												then was) aforesaid was not 
												based on the failure by the 
												Electoral Commission to add the 
												result from the polling station 
												(060701A to the tally as 
												disclosed in the last paragraph 
												of their brief to the 
												Attorney-General. Indeed when 
												the said election petition was 
												filed the said brief of 31st 
												January 1997 had not been 
												written or signed by the 
												Electoral Commission and the 
												respondent did not know that not 
												only were votes cast wrongly 
												credited to those for whom they 
												were not cast in some polling 
												stations but that in one polling 
												station votes cast were not 
												added at all to the tally thus 
												completely violating the 
												imperative duties imposed on the 
												Electoral Commission by statute. 
												In respect of that particular 
												polling station, the complaint 
												would be one not of performing 
												the statutory functions wrongly 
												but of failing completely to 
												discharge the statutory 
												functions. In the jurisdictional 
												language, it was not a case of 
												committing errors in the 
												exercise of the jurisdiction but 
												a case of failure to exercise 
												the jurisdiction at all&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is my considered opinion that 
												these facts as have been related 
												by Counsel for the respondent do 
												not detract from the legal 
												effect of dismissal of the 
												respondent&#8217;s petition and the 
												law relating to estoppel per rem 
												judication and limitation of 
												actons as I have endeavoured to 
												analyse above. It is admitted by 
												or on behalf of the respondent 
												that he had a cause of action 
												accruing to him from the day the 
												election results were announced. 
												The fact that he did not know at 
												the time he filed the petition 
												that there was in existence 
												further evidence in support of 
												his claim did not make the 
												situation any different. If the 
												respondent had instituted his 
												petition within the statutory 
												period there can be no doubt 
												that Gbadegbe J (as he then was) 
												would have taken all the facts 
												that the respondent claimed came 
												to his knowledge subsequently. 
												Our rules of evidence permit 
												parties to call and recall 
												witnesses to adduce fresh 
												evidence even on appeal, 
												provided the prescribed legal 
												requirements are fulfilled and 
												the ends of justice could be 
												assured thereby. But I am not 
												prepared to accept the 
												submission or suggestion that 
												where a party commences legal 
												proceedings in court and the 
												action is dismissed or struck 
												out as statute-barred he can 
												resuscitate the action on the 
												ground of discovery of evidence 
												which in his view tends to 
												strengthen the case he commenced 
												out of time. And it is extremely 
												important in the interest of 
												fairness to parties to a case 
												that a court of law be extra 
												cautious in exposing all forms 
												of attempts by parties whose 
												actions have been declared 
												statue-barred or caught by some 
												rule of estoppel resuscitating 
												their actions under a new guise 
												to defeat justice. It is as well 
												to state that where by any rule 
												of law or procedure the right to 
												pursue an action in court is 
												frustrated i.e. by estoppel per 
												rem judicatem or by the law of 
												limitation of actions or even on 
												the ground of lack of capacity, 
												it is no answer to say that the 
												party who is so frustrated could 
												if allowed to pursue the case on 
												the merits have emerged 
												victorious. Apaloo CJ (as he 
												then was) in the case of 
												Sarkodee v. Boateng (1982-82) 
												GLR 715 at 724 put the matter in 
												a lucid language thus: &#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220; It is claimed in one of the 
												more serious grounds of appeal 
												that substantial questions were 
												involved in the suit and it was 
												unjust for the appellant to be 
												driven from &#8220;the judgment seat&#8221; 
												on the preliminary objection 
												raised by the respondent. But it 
												is no answer for a party against 
												whom a serious question of locus 
												standi is raised, to plead that 
												he should be given a hearing on 
												the merits because he has a 
												cast-iron case against his 
												opponent&#8221;. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Ground two raises the vexed 
												question of whether the 
												prerogative writs of certiorari 
												and mandamus lie against the 
												Electoral Commission in the 
												performance of its duties. The 
												answer must be in the 
												affirmative. There are two 
												relevant provisions of the 
												Constitution 1992 on this issue. 
												It is provided under articles 23 
												and 33 of the Constitution, 1972 
												that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;23 Administrative bodies and 
												administrative officials shall 
												act fairly and reasonably and 
												comply with the requirements 
												imposed on them by law and 
												persons aggrieved by the 
												exercise of such acts and 
												decisions shall have the right 
												to seek redress before a court 
												or other tribunal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												33(1) Where a person alleges 
												that a provision of this 
												constitution on the fundamental 
												human right and freedom has 
												been, or is being or is likely 
												to be contravened in relation to 
												him, then without prejudice to 
												any other action that is 
												lawfully available that person 
												may apply to the High Court for 
												redress.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) The High Court may, under 
												clause (1) of this article, 
												issue such directions or orders 
												or writs including writs or 
												orders in the nature of habeas 
												corpus, certiorari, mandamus, 
												prohibition and quo warranto, as 
												it may consider appropriate for 
												the purposes of enforcing or 
												securing the enforcement of any 
												of the provisions on the 
												fundamental human rights and 
												freedoms to the protection of 
												which the person concerned is 
												entitled.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(4) The Rules of Court Committee 
												may make rules of court with 
												respect to the practice and 
												procedure of the Superior Courts 
												for the purposes of this 
												article&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The prerogative writs have been 
												the most effective power in the 
												hands of English monarchs in 
												controlling the judicial and 
												quasi judicial decisions of 
												inferior courts, tribunals and 
												other adjudicatory bodies 
												whenever they are found to have 
												committed breaches of natural 
												justice or assumed wrong 
												jurisdiction or made errors of 
												law on the face of their 
												records: see R. v. 
												Northumberland Compensation 
												Appeal Tribunal, Ex parte Shaw 
												(1951) 1 KB 711; R. v. Surrey 
												Justices (1870) L.R. 5 QB 466; 
												King v. London County Council 
												Ex-parte Entertainments 
												Protection Association (1931) 2 
												KB 215. Local authorities abound 
												in this area of the law: see 
												Republic v. High Court Sekondi 
												Ex-parte Abuna (1992) 1 GLR 524 
												CA and others. But I conceive it 
												to be imperative to concentrate 
												on mandamus, one of the 
												prerogative writs used to compel 
												the institutions mentioned above 
												or individuals to perform their 
												statutory duties. That order may 
												be issued against any inferior 
												court or tribunal or other 
												adjudicatory body or a body not 
												necessarily a court to carry out 
												some public duty. In his famous 
												book &#8220;Constitutional Law Of 
												Great Britain And The 
												Commonwealth&#8221; 2nd edition page 
												446 the learned author Hood 
												Philips says: &#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The order of mandamus may be 
												issued to any person or body not 
												necessarily an inferior court, 
												commanding him or them to carry 
												out some public duty. It does 
												not lie to compel the exercise 
												of a discretionary power. It is 
												a residuary remedy of use where 
												no other remedy is available, or 
												if some other remedy is provided 
												by statute (Parsmore v. 
												Oswaldt-wistle Urban District 
												Counsel (1898) AC 387&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the case of Republic v. 
												Akyeamfour 11(1982-83) GLR p 11 
												the Court of Appeal held that 
												certiorari or mandamus could not 
												lie against the National House 
												of Chiefs to insert the name of 
												a chief in the register of 
												chiefs because that act was a 
												purely administrative act.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It appears, however, that that 
												decision has been shorn of its 
												vigour in the light of the 
												provisions of the Constitution 
												1992, article 23. It would also 
												appear that the decision in The 
												Republic v. Inspector-General Of 
												Police Ex-parte Hanson and 
												others (1992) 2 GLR 174 where 
												mandamus to compel the IGP to 
												issue a permit was refused is no 
												longer good law. But this 
												notwithstanding, the exception 
												stated by Hood Philips in his 
												book is still applicable to our 
												law that mandamus is not 
												permissible if a statute 
												provides another remedy. In his 
												written statement of case 
												Counsel for the respondent is on 
												record as saying at p 16 thereof 
												as follows: &#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220; In &#8220;Administrative Law&#8221; by HWR 
												Wade and CF Forsyth published in 
												1996 the distinguished and 
												learned authors have this to 
												say: &#8220;Certiorari and prohibition 
												are employed primarily for the 
												control of inferior courts, 
												tribunals and administrative 
												authorities. Crown courts, 
												County Courts, justices of the 
												peace, coroners and all 
												statutory tribunals are liable 
												to have their decisions quashed 
												or their proceedings prohibited 
												except where Parliament provides 
												otherwise and sometimes even 
												when it does. So are all other 
												public authorities whether their 
												functions are judicial or 
												administrative&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It would be seen clearly from 
												this statement, that these 
												learned authors share the view 
												of Hood Philips because they 
												recognise the exception clause 
												to the effect that the court may 
												and must not employ prerogative 
												writs where the legislature has 
												prescribed a specific remedy for 
												any person aggrieved by the 
												decision or act of the 
												institutions mentioned. Even 
												though these distinguished 
												authors dare to extend the 
												prerogative writs to situations 
												where Parliament enacts 
												otherwise, I would not accept 
												that aspect of their view. I 
												prefer the view? Of Hood Philips 
												because that accords with the 
												view which has had the nod of 
												our Supreme Court. This takes me 
												back again to the case of 
												Michael Yeboah v. J.H. Mensah 
												(supra), this time round, to the 
												opinion of Acquah JSC where this 
												young but exceptionally 
												resourceful judge says as 
												follows: &#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220; Now once the plaintiff had the 
												right as held by the court to 
												apply for an enforcement of the 
												provisions of the Constitution 
												under articles 2(1) and 106(1) 
												of the 1969 Constitution, and at 
												the same time had a right under 
												article 76(1) (a) of the 1969 
												Constitution to present an 
												election petition in accordance 
												with NLCD 255, my understanding 
												of the law, in those 
												circumstances was that the 
												plaintiff could elect which of 
												the two remedies to pursue and 
												that he could not pursue both 
												remedies as he did. For the 
												principle is quite well-settled 
												that an individual who has a 
												civil remedy under two or more 
												enactment's, or two such 
												remedies under the same statute, 
												has a right to elect which 
												remedy to pursue but cannot 
												pursue both. Thus at page 441 
												paragraph 666 of Halsbury's Laws 
												of England 3rd edition it is 
												stated: &#8220;An individual who has a 
												civil remedy under two or more 
												statutes, or under a statute and 
												at common law must elect to 
												pursue only one of these 
												remedies (emphasis mine)&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The undisputed facts of this 
												case show clearly that the nerve 
												centre of the respondent's 
												grievance was that some 
												injustice had been meted out to 
												him at the 1996 parliamentary 
												election. He knew or ought to 
												have known that elaborate 
												provisions existed in the PNDCL 
												284 for remedying such injustice 
												or any unfair treatment against 
												him in the counting of votes or 
												any other form of unlawful act 
												committed against him to his 
												prejudice. He was equally deemed 
												to know of the remedies provided 
												under the Constitution yet he 
												elected to go by an election 
												petition under the PNDCL 284. 
												All the prerogative remedies 
												which the respondent requested 
												from the High Court after the 
												election petition debacle were 
												directed against acts and 
												omissions of or by the Electoral 
												Commission in the conduct of the 
												elections. The powers, which 
												these prerogative writs invest 
												in the High Court, were all 
												exercisable by it under the 
												election petition procedure (see 
												section 19, 20 and 21 of the 
												PNDCL 284). Consequently, it is 
												my considered view that having 
												elected to pursue his remedy 
												under one enactment, the 
												respondent cannot turn round to 
												have a second bite at the cherry 
												merely because he lost the case 
												or because after, at or during 
												the pendency of the election 
												petition, fresh evidence that 
												existed but might have been 
												unknown to him had emerged to 
												make his case stronger than it 
												was before.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is precisely because of the 
												fact our legislature has in its 
												wisdom provided the good people 
												of this country a special law in 
												respect of disputed election 
												results (vide PNDCL 284). While 
												this legislation is in force, no 
												one can by pass it to litigate 
												election results by prerogative 
												writs. I shall endeavour to 
												reproduce in detail the relevant 
												provisions of the PNDCL 284 to 
												demonstrate its rationale. I now 
												proceed to deal with ground 
												three of the grounds of appeal, 
												whether the law applicable to 
												this case is the PNDCL 284 or CI 
												15. Without any hesitation, I 
												would say that CI 15 (The Public 
												Elections Regulations 1996) as 
												its name and provisions clearly 
												demonstrate, is concerned with 
												the rules and regulations for 
												the actual conduct of elections 
												in the polling stations and 
												elections results. But the 
												Representation of The People 
												Law, 1992 (PNDCL 284) deals with 
												a whole range of different but 
												substantive subjects including, 
												arrangement of constituencies 
												for parliamentary elections, 
												qualifications for voters and 
												candidates seeking election, 
												election petitions and other 
												legal proceedings, election 
												offences, and other 
												miscellaneous provisions. There 
												is no provision in CI 15 for 
												election petition and other 
												legal proceedings except under 
												section 39, so when one talks of 
												lawsuits CI 15 does not come 
												into the picture at all. Even so 
												under the CI 15 the procedure 
												for challenging any 
												electioneering, or voting wrongs 
												or omissions by officers of the 
												Electoral Commission is the 
												election petition for section 39 
												of that constitutional 
												instrument states that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220; 39 The decision of the 
												returning officer on any 
												question arising in respect of a 
												ballot paper is subject to 
												adjudication or review on an 
												election petition to the High 
												Court.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												If this is the procedure against 
												a ballot paper then, why should 
												any person convince this court 
												that he can come to the High 
												Court on other disputes 
												affecting the elections for 
												which ballot papers were 
												intended? For the purposes of 
												this case, I wish to reproduce 
												sections 16 and 17 and 18 of the 
												PNDCL 284. It is provided under

												This legislation was specially 
												made to provide the people of 
												this country with the methods 
												for questioning elections. 
												Section 17(b) is emphatic that 
												any person in the position of 
												the respondent who claimed that 
												he had the right to be declared 
												winner at the election can only 
												resort to an election petition. 
												The decree does not prescribe 
												any procedure in the nature of 
												the prerogative writ known to 
												civil procedure. This is 
												confirmed by the Supreme Court 
												in the case of Michael Yeboah v. 
												J.H. Mensah (supra). The Supreme 
												Court through Hayfron-Benjamin 
												JSC (as he then was) cited 
												leading English authorities 
												including Wilkinson v. Barking 
												Corporation (1948) KB 721 per 
												Asquith LJ; Pasmore v. Oswald 
												Twisth UND 1898 AC 387 at 384 
												per Lord Halsbury to illustrate 
												the point in support of an 
												election petition. The other 
												judges including Acquah JSC also 
												cited cases needless to 
												catalogue. I think I have said 
												all that in my considered 
												opinion is relevant to this 
												appeal and I have to pronounce 
												the final result of the appeal 
												but before that I wish to refer 
												to rule 31(e) of the Court of 
												Appeal Rules, 1997 [CI 19] to 
												direct a focus of attention to 
												the power of this court when it 
												considers an appeal. That rule 
												provides that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;31 (e) The Court of Appeal ... 
												shall generally have full 
												jurisdiction over the whole 
												proceedings as if the 
												proceedings had been instituted 
												and prosecuted in the Court as a 
												court of first instance.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the exercise of these powers 
												available to this court, I have 
												placed myself into the shoes of 
												the learned trial High Court 
												judge right from the time the 
												case came before her and the 
												preliminary objection was 
												raised. It would be seen, 
												therefore, that matters which 
												counsel perhaps never thought 
												about in their submissions have 
												been treated and in my view this 
												appeal could even have ended in 
												favour of the appellant with 
												ground one alone, but I went the 
												full distance to deal with the 
												three grounds to let justice be 
												seen not only to be done but 
												manifestly be seen to have been 
												done. In my considered opinion, 
												this appeal has substantial 
												merit and it is accordingly 
												allowed on all the three grounds 
												of appeal. The judgment and 
												orders of the court below are 
												hereby set aside.</span></p>
