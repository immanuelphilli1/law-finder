						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<font face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US">The appellant 
						herein was convicted by the General Court Martial held 
						at the (MATS) Accra, on 5th June 2007 on charges of (1) 
						Conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline 
						for improper possession of notes containing Directing 
						Staff Solutions to 2005 Practical Promotion Examination 
						Level A examination question. Information which had not 
						been issued to examination candidates, contrary to 
						Section 54(1) of the Armed Forces Act 1962 (Act 105) and 
						(2) Conduct to the prejudice of good order and 
						discipline for cheating contrary to Section 54(1) of the 
						Armed Forces Act 1962 (Act 105). The particulars of 
						Count 2 are that the appellant cheated during the 2005 
						Level Alpha Practical Promotion examination by 
						dishonestly making use of yet to be issued examination 
						question and Directing Staff Solutions before they were 
						officially released. Upon his conviction on both 
						charges, the appellant was sentenced to dismissal from 
						the Ghana Armed Forces. This appeal is therefore in 
						respect of the said conviction and sentence. The appeal 
						is founded on two grounds ie. a. the conviction is 
						against the weight of evidence and b. the trial court 
						failed to find that the appellant used directing staff 
						solutions to write notes in his note pad. According to 
						learned counsel for the appellant his client, together 
						with other officers were candidates who were involved in 
						Practical Promotion Examination for Army Officers Level 
						Alpha 2005. In the course of the examinations, it was 
						detected that some of the candidates, including the 
						appellant, had notes in their note-pads which were said 
						to be similar to the Directing Staff Solutions. The 
						appellant was consequently not made to write the 
						practical examinations on the assumption that he had 
						prior knowledge of yet-to-be-issued Requirement 3. The 
						appellant denied any such prior knowledge and insisted 
						that it was as a result of discussions he had with other 
						candidates as well as the trend of the questions which 
						enabled him to put down the notes in his note-pad. 
						Counsel for the appellant contended that the law 
						enjoined the prosecution to adduce cogent evidence to 
						prove the alleged facts. He referred to the Court of 
						Appeal decision in ASARE vs THE REPUBLIC [1978] GLR 193 
						with approval in support of his contention. The relevant 
						part of the holding was that: &quot;...as a general rule 
						there is no burden on the accused; that he is presumed 
						innocent until his guilt is established beyond 
						reasonable doubt; that the burden is rather on the 
						prosecution to prove the charge against him beyond 
						reasonable doubt i.e the jury must be satisfied upon the 
						evidence so that they feel sure of the guilt of the 
						accused and that if they are left in doubt whether the 
						accused is guilty or not guilty, then the prosecution 
						have failed to prove the case against him and he is 
						entitled as of right to a verdict of not guilty.&quot; To 
						strengthen his argument further, learned counsel for 
						appellant cited section 11(2) of the Evidence Decree 
						[1975] (NRCD 323) which provides that: &quot;In criminal 
						action, the burden of producing evidence, when it is on 
						the prosecution as to any fact which is essential to 
						guilt, requires the prosecution to produce sufficient 
						evidence so hat on all the evidence, a reasonable mind 
						could find the existence of the fact beyond a reasonable 
						doubt&quot;. Further references were made by learned counsel 
						seeking to drive home his argument more forcefully. I do 
						not need to go into all of that because they really do 
						not add anything new to what is required of the 
						prosecution that they must prove the guilt of the 
						accused beyond reasonable doubt. After the above 
						references to the standard of proof, learned counsel for 
						the appellant repeated the two charges against the 
						appellant and submitted that the prosecution were not 
						able to prove that there was a Directing Staff Solution 
						which constitute the foundation of the offences for 
						which the appellant was charged adding that this failure 
						amounts to a fatal collapse of the charges preferred 
						against the accused person. For the next stage of 
						counsel's argument he carefully examined the evidence 
						led by the prosecution through Pw1 and submitted that 
						from the evidence of Pw1 it is clear that the charge of 
						conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline 
						does not even have a leg to stand on because the Pw1 had 
						said there was nothing like Directing Staff Solution but 
						rather a guide to assist the Directing Staff. He further 
						submitted that the notes/point that were found in the 
						note pad of the appellant were not Directing Staff 
						Solutions and did not constitute the solution 
						requirement as alleged. This is because there was no 
						Directing Staff Solution, which was alleged to have 
						leaked. To conclude his submissions counsel for the 
						appellant cited the case of LUTTEROOT vs COMMISSIONER OF 
						POLICE [1963]2GLR 429 SC which decided that where a 
						decision of a trial court turns upon the oath of a 
						prosecution witness against that of a defence witness, 
						it is incumbent on the trial court to examine the 
						evidence of the said witnesses carefully along with 
						other evidence adduced at the trial before preferring 
						one to the other. If the court prefers the evidence of 
						the prosecution then it must give reasons for the 
						preference, but if it is unable to give any reasons for 
						the preference, then that means that there is a 
						reasonable doubt as to which of the versions of the 
						story is true in which case, the benefit of the doubt 
						must be given to the defence. In response to the above 
						arguments and submissions of counsel for the appellant 
						the learned counsel for the respondent argued that it is 
						misleading on the part of the appellants to claim that 
						there was no Directing Staff Solution as there was ample 
						evidence on the record to the contrary. He reiterated 
						that the terms &quot;Directing Staff Solution&quot; and &quot;Marking 
						Guide&quot; are used interchangeably, which, in military 
						terminology, refers to what is known in civil language 
						as Marking Scheme and referred to the part of the 
						evidence of Pw1 which sought to emphasize his ground of 
						disagreement with the appellant. What the Pw1 said was 
						that &quot;In practical promotion examinations and for that 
						matter in tactics there are no fixed or permanent 
						solutions to tactical requirement.. .In this case where 
						it is practical, a Guide is given to the Directing Staff 
						to follow in assessing the candidate. In such a case, we 
						call it a Directing Staff Guide, but in essence, it is a 
						solution sort of... Even the suggested Directing Staff 
						Solution is also a Guide... To conclude I will see the 
						Directing Staff Guide and the suggested Directing Staff 
						Solution as virtually solutions to the Requirement&quot;. In 
						the view of learned counsel for the respondent Exhibit E 
						was a Directing Staff Solution or Directing Staff 
						Marking Guide and submitted that in the absence of a 
						Directing Staff Solution there would be no basis for 
						assessing the examination candidates. In this judgment, 
						it is my respectful view that the existence or otherwise 
						of a Directing Staff Solution is a matter of fact, not 
						fiction, and this issue can be resolved having regard to 
						the evidence led at the trial. In his evidence in chief, 
						Pw1 was handed a document which he described as 
						containing the narratives, the requirement, the guide to 
						the Directing Staff Solution and some solutions. That 
						document was admitted into evidence without any 
						objection from the appellant, as Exhibit E. After 
						Exhibit E had been tendered, Pw1 again described it as 
						the Requirement and the Guide to the Directing Staff at 
						page 9 of which the questions were stated. This piece of 
						evidence identifying Exhibit E with, among other things, 
						the Directing Staff Solution was confirmed by Pw2 who 
						said that exhibit contained the Requirements i.e. 
						questions, and solutions and instructions to Practical 
						Promotion Exams. Lt Capt 2005. Apart from the evidence 
						of Pw1 and Pw2, the document in question, Exhibit E 
						speaks volumes about itself. I am satisfied that the 
						contention by the appellant that there was not Directing 
						Staff. Solution and therefore the prosecution had not 
						produced. sufficient or cogent enough evidence to meet 
						the required standard of proof fails and it is therefore 
						not upheld in this judgment. The next issue to determine 
						relates to whether or not there was proof beyond 
						reasonable doubt that the appellant conducted himself in 
						a manner. prejudicial to good order and discipline in 
						the Ghana Armed Forces, in accordance to section 54(1) 
						of Act 105. The evidence of both prosecution witnesses, 
						Pw1 and Pw2 showed that when the members of Syndicate 2 
						which included the appellant, were called in, to 
						consider Requirement 3, the appellant and four other 
						candidates did not turn up until about thirty minutes 
						after the exams had started. When they eventually 
						arrived, Pw1 decided to search them. The search 
						disclosed that the appellant had prepared answers or 
						solutions in his note pad Exhibit F3 on some of the 
						questions in the Requirement, even though at the time of 
						the search, the said examination question paper had not 
						been issued out to him. The prepared answers or 
						solutions were on Deployment, surveillance, Fire Plan 
						and Counter-attack plan and also a mission for left 
						forward platoon. According to Pw1 the appellant was not 
						required to make any entries into the note pad until 
						after the exam question papers had been issued. It is 
						really quite inexplicable that that after Pw1's incisive 
						testimony, counsel for the appellant hardly challenged 
						any statement that Pw1 had made concerning or 
						implicating the appellant. Further to the evidence of 
						Pw1, Pw2 tendered into evidence as Exhibit M the 
						statement he had obtained from the appellant on the 
						issue. In the said Exhibit M, the appellant stated that: 
						&quot;... .I recorded all the discussions in my field note 
						book before the Requirement Three was issued. After 
						being issued with the Requirement Three Lt-Col. Vib 
						Sanziri looked through my note pad and saw that the 
						notes in them corresponded with the answers to be given 
						to Requirement Three.:..&quot; Exhibit M was made by the 
						appellant of 13th May-2005. On the very next day 14th 
						May 2005 the appellant wrote a second or further 
						statement Exhibit N in which he stated that &quot;prior to 
						leaving for the exam, I had a copy of the questions from 
						Lt Debrah. I however destroyed the copy on Tuesday 
						before leaving for the exercise area. Learned counsel 
						for the appellant in his submission before us cited the 
						case of LUTTERODT vs C.O.P [1963] 2GLR 429 SC where the 
						Supreme Court sought to guide all lower courts on the 
						principles regarding oath of the prosecution witness(es) 
						against that of the defence. My understanding of that 
						principle is that it could be applied where there was 
						absence of contradictions in either the prosecution or 
						the defence. Thus in AIDOO vs THE STATE [1963] 2GLR 84 
						the same Court held that &quot;(3) where a witness gives two 
						different versic5ns of the same incident, the 
						determination of which of the versions is true is a 
						question of fact for the jury. A direction by the judge 
						to accept one version in preference to the other would 
						be usurping the function of the jury; if the cautioned 
						statement and evidence given by the appellant at the 
						trial had been exactly the same, there would have been 
						substances in the submission that the judge should have 
						directed the jury to accept the appellant's evidence on 
						the incident&quot;. In view of the inconsistency of the 
						appellant in this case, I am of the view that the 
						decision in LUTORODT's case would not avail him. 
						Exhibits M and. N contradict the appellant's evidence 
						before the court. Furthermore the appellant made a very 
						feeble, lame and unsuccessful attempt to back track from 
						his admission of his criminal conduct. In his own 
						evidence in defence of the charge the appellant 
						confessed to the discussion he had had with one Lt 
						Debrah leading to the question paper that the appellant 
						had received from the said Lt Debrah which according to 
						him, he destroyed before going to the examination area 
						Led by his counsel, appellant told the court that he 
						destroyed the exam paper that Lt Debrah gave to him 
						becaáse &quot;...I knew I was not supposed to send them to 
						the examinations area, So I destroyed all the papers&quot;. 
						This evidence in chief was given on 1st June 2006. On 
						8th June 2006 however, and rather inexplicably, the 
						defence was able to conjure into life the very 
						examination question papers that Lt Debrah had allegedly 
						given to the appellant. Counsel asked and the appellant 
						replied as follows:- Q. The last time you were here you 
						told the court that you had past papers of 2004 
						Practical Promotion Exam you received from Lt Debarh do 
						you have the papers here? A. Yes my Lord. I want to 
						tender it as evidence? This latter twist from his 
						previous evidence on oath which is also a departure from 
						his previous statement exhibits M and N take the story 
						of the appellant away from the ambit and scope of the 
						decision in LUTTERODT vs COP and with respect, enters 
						the scope of events better envisaged by the decision in 
						AIDOO vs THE STATE (supra). On the whole I am satisfied 
						that the prosecution 1n this case succeeded in proving 
						the case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt 
						that he, the appellant conducted himself In a way that 
						was prejudicial to good order and discipline within the 
						Ghana Armed Forces. The last ground I find relevant to 
						consider relates to the charge of cheating. I have had 
						occasion to state elsewhere that neither the Criminal 
						Offences Act of Ghana 1960 (Act 29) nor the Armed Forces 
						Act 1962 (Act 105). recognized cheating as a criminal 
						offence. In the face of the further fact that section 8 
						specifically states that a person is not liable to 
						punishment by the common law for any act, I am fortified 
						to submit that the charge contained in count two does 
						not apply, and that the conviction thereon was bad for 
						the following further reason. The Ghana Armed Forces as 
						an institution did not produce any legislation or 
						regulation that made cheating an offence punishable as a 
						crime. Beside the above, the evidence led in the trial 
						was very scanty and not direct. Where cases had been 
						tried based on cheating, the actual act constituting the 
						offence was stated in 'evidence. Contrariwise in this 
						case, Pw1 specifically said on oath under cross 
						examination by learned counsel for the appellant that 
						the appellant did not cheat. Hear him Q. Would it be 
						correct to say that it was because of your diligence 
						that the candidates did not make use of the notes in 
						their note books. A. That is correct, if I had allowed 
						them it would have been a cheat. Q. In accordance with 
						your duties you ensured that they did not cheat. A. Yes. 
						Clearly upon the evidence before us, the appellant was 
						not given the chance to consummate any intention or 
						attempt to cheat because he was prevented torn taking 
						the examination. In contract to the evidence before us, 
						we may it random take a look at. .BOEHM vs UNIVERSITY OF 
						PENNSYLVANIA SCHOOL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 392 Pa Super 
						502 (1990) 573 A2d 575 where two students were found 
						guilty of violating the Code of Student Rights and 
						Academic Integrity by engaging in &quot;behaviour suspicious 
						of and compatible with cheating&quot;. It was stated that 
						what constitutes cheating in a test situation includes 
						from the strict definition that even a brief but 
						focussed glance at a fellow student's exam paper is, of 
						itself, a clear act of cheating, and that overt cheating 
						can only be established if the accused can be shown to 
						have benefited from the practice or was caught with 
						tangible evidence such as crib sheets or consistently 
						identical answer sheets. The. court made a few findings 
						of fact including the fact that a comparison of test 
						scores of the two students accused of cheating was 
						introduced as evidence. They were observed on at least 
						three occasions to be engaged in behaviour 
						indistinguishable from cheating. Maria Stanik was seen 
						looking at Cheryl Boehm's paper during the exams etc. I 
						need not emphasize that the two students involved were 
						actually in the examination room during the examination. 
						All their conduct complained of, took place in the exam 
						room and in the process of the examinations. A second 
						case for illustration is COMMONWEALTH vs CABELL 199 Pa 
						Supreme 513 (1962) where the defendant Cabell inter alia 
						made a mark in a certain test given under a civil 
						service regulation by placing on an examination paper, 
						purporting to be his own the examination number of the 
						other defendant, by name Luck. The second defendant, 
						according to evidence had agreed to pay to Cabell US $50 
						to take a civil service examination for foreman on 
						Luck's behalf. The two defendants, in the examination 
						room, exchanged examination numbers so that Cabell's 
						paper appeared to be that of Luck and vice versa. 
						Cabell's paper which had Luck's index number achieved a 
						high score and was number one on the eligible list. The 
						necessary ingredients to sustain a charge of cheating 
						are obviously absent in the appeal before us. The main 
						distinguishing factors are that (a) no specific law or 
						regulation creating &quot;cheating&quot; as a crime or offence has 
						been cited. (b) the appellant did not enter the 
						examination room and was therefore not observed in the 
						examination room or during the examinations to be 
						indulging in acts or conduct amounting to cheating (c) 
						the appellant was not charged with attempting to cheat. 
						I am of the view that the conviction of the appellant on 
						count 2 for cheating cannot be sustained and I 
						accordingly vote for quashing that conviction. The 
						conviction in count one that the appellant conducted 
						himself in a way prejudicial to good order and 
						discipline is affirmed. COUNSEL MR PUDZUING FORE
