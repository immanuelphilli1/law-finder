												A background to this appeal is 
												as follows: On 7th May, 1997, in 
												a civil case number Misc.768/97, 
												J. K. Dolphyne v. S. E. A. 
												Brenya and Gladys Dede Adjetey, 
												the High Court made orders for 
												Interim Injunction and for the 
												appointment of Receiver and 
												Manager. After the High Court 
												had given final judgment in the 
												case it ordered the two 
												Receivers and Managers to hand 
												over their stewardship to two 
												others. The order as drawn and 
												signed by the trial judge and 
												the registrar of the court. It 
												reads:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">

												NOW THEREFORE IT IS HEREBY

												Receivers and Managers will 
												however, continue to sign the

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Upon Certiorari application to 
												the Supreme Court the concluding 
												part of its ruling reads: &#8220;For a 
												High Court can appoint receivers 
												and managers to manage the 
												affairs of the company but the 
												Court cannot, after revoking 
												their appointment, purport to 
												appoint directors and determine 
												which particular directors 
												should sign the cheques of the 
												company. The Code does not give 
												the High Court such 
												jurisdiction. Hence, our 
												unanimous decision quashing the 
												judgment and orders of the High 
												Court dated 12th May 2000 and 
												19th January 2001&#8221;. The next 
												step taken against the two 
												receivers and managers was the 
												issue of writ against them for 
												the following reliefs: &#8220;1. The 
												sum of ¢2,617,408,000 being 
												monies belonging to the 
												plaintiff, which was 
												misappropriated by defendants in 
												the course of their duty as 
												Receivers and Managers of the 
												plaintiff company. 2. A 
												declaration that 6% commission 
												ordered by the High Court Accra 
												to be paid to the defendants as 
												Receivers and Managers of the 
												plaintiff company from 1st 
												November 1997 to 31st January 
												2001 is payable net of all 
												deductions and not gross. 3. 
												Interest on the said sum form 
												31st January 2001 to date of 
												final judgment. 4. Costs.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Before hearing commenced counsel 
												for the second defendant was 
												allowed by the court to argue 
												his preliminary objection based 
												on a point of issue raised in 
												the summons for Directions 
												namely: &#8220;Whether or not the 
												plaintiff company does not have 
												the capacity to bring the 
												present action&#8221;. Before the High 
												Court counsel for the second 
												defendant argued that the lack 
												of capacity of the plaintiff 
												company is derived from the 
												provision of section 239 of the 
												Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179), 
												which reads: &#8220;A receiver or 
												manager of any property or 
												undertaking of a company 
												appointed by the Court shall be 
												deemed to be an officer of the 
												Court and not of the company and 
												shall act in accordance with the 
												directions and instruction of 
												the Court.&#8221; The court below 
												overruled his objection to the 
												capacity of the plaintiff 
												company in bringing the action 
												as frivolous and completely 
												without merit. The court was of 
												the opinion that: &#8220;There is 
												nothing in section 239 of Act 
												179 or in law generally which 
												exempts the Receiver and Manager 
												appointed by the Court from 
												action for alleged misconduct in 
												respect of the Company&#8217;s 
												property&#8221;. The second defendant 
												appealed against the High 
												Court&#8217;s ruling. His only ground 
												of appeal before this Court is 
												that &#8220;The learned trial judge 
												erred in law in dismissing the 
												second defendant&#8217;s legal 
												objection that on a true and 
												proper interpretation of section 
												239 of the Companies Code, Act 
												179 the plaintiff had no 
												capacity to sue the second 
												defendant and that he was not an 
												agent of the plaintiff&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As can be seen from the ground 
												of appeal, the focus of this 
												appeal is that by virtue of 
												section 239 of the Companies 
												Code the plaintiff company does 
												not have the capacity to bring 
												the action against the second 
												defendant/appellant and the 
												first defendant. Therefore we 
												would do well to explore the 
												scope of section 239 of the 
												Companies Code. In his ruling, 
												Afreh, J.S.C. explained the 
												effect of the appointment of 
												Receiver and Manager as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The effect of appointment of a 
												Receiver and Manager by the 
												court is that the court assumes 
												control of the property 
												affected, and from that time the 
												parties to the action retain 
												possession only as custodians of 
												the court: See Halsbury&#8217;s Laws 
												of England, 3rd Edition Vol. 32, 
												paragraph 674 page 415. The 
												court in effect takes the 
												custody of the property into its 
												own hands &#8212; for the receiver is 
												an officer of the court &#8212; and 
												thus assumes the protection and 
												safekeeping of it: See Palmer&#8217;s 
												Company Law 20th Edition page 
												417. The appointment of a 
												Receiver and Manager by the 
												court under s. 293 of Act 179 
												does not in any way affect the 
												existence or separate 
												personality of the Company. The 
												Court does not replace or &#8216;take 
												over&#8217; the company.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Company does not lose its 
												right to bring action to 
												vindicate or protect its rights 
												when it regains full control 
												over its assets&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The import of section 239 of the 
												Companies Code is that the 
												receivers and managers appointed 
												by the Court fulfil their 
												obligation so long as they act 
												in accordance with the 
												directives and instructions of 
												the Court and not otherwise. 
												That means they are answerable 
												only to the Court so far as the 
												Court&#8217;s mandate is concerned. I 
												do not think that the position 
												remains the same if they go 
												beyond the mandate and their 
												conduct infringes the rights of 
												others. In real terms, upon 
												their appointment as receivers 
												and managers, management of the 
												company is ceded to the court, 
												which acts through the receivers 
												and managers. As officers and 
												indeed agents of the court, 
												receivers and managers take 
												directions and instructions from 
												the court and are answerable 
												only to the court throughout the 
												entire period of their 
												stewardship. It means in the 
												course of their appointment as 
												receivers and managers, any 
												person outside the court who 
												seeks to question the conduct of 
												their stewardship or in any way 
												call upon them to account, for 
												obvious reasons, must seek leave 
												of the court to do so. It is 
												only in this context that we 
												ought to look at the case of 
												L.P. Arthur (Insurance Ltd.) v. 
												Sisson and Others [1966] 2 All 
												E. R. 1003, referred to by 
												counsel for the appellant as 
												authority for his proposition 
												that leave of the court ought to 
												be sought for prior to any 
												action against a receiver and 
												manager. In that case the 
												conduct of the receiver 
												complained of occurred between 
												October 1963 when the receiver 
												was appointed andsic March 1964, 
												when the company went into 
												liquidation and the application 
												for leave came on before the 
												receivership came to an end.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is worthy of note that the 
												alleged malfeasance occurred 
												during the receivership, and the 
												application for leave came 
												before taking of receiver&#8217;s 
												accounts and not after it, as in 
												the instant case. In the instant 
												case the appointment as managers 
												and receivers had come to an 
												end. The action against the two 
												defendants did not stem from any 
												perceived breach of duties by 
												them as agents of the company 
												and that was made quite clear by 
												the ruling of the court below. 
												At page 37 of the record of 
												appeal the learned judge makes 
												the following observation:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;It appears from the contentions 
												of the 2nd defendant&#8217;s counsel 
												in his Statement of Defence and 
												before me that he thinks that 
												the plaintiff company has sued 
												the defendants for breach of 
												their duties as agents of the 
												company. The plaintiff has not 
												done that. Its claim is for the 
												specified sum of four billion, 
												five hundred and forty-seven 
												million, three hundred and 
												ninety-four thousand cedis 
												(¢4,547,394,000) being monies 
												belonging to the plaintiff&#8217;s 
												company, which was 
												misappropriated by the 
												defendants in the course of 
												their duty as Receivers and 
												Managers of the company. It is 
												in effect a claim in tort for 
												conversion.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The claim against the defendants 
												is independent of their 
												appointment as receivers and 
												managers as well as their duties 
												as officers of the court, which 
												in any case had come to an end. 
												It is not a claim for their 
												accountability as receivers and 
												managers simply because they 
												have already rendered accounts 
												to the court and they have 
												handed over in the manner 
												prescribed by the court. It 
												comes at the end of their 
												stewardship and not in the 
												course of it. I agree with the 
												observation of the court below 
												in its ruling that &#8220;there is 
												nothing in section 239 of Act 
												179 or in Law generally that 
												exempts Receiver and Manager 
												appointed by the court from 
												action for alleged misconduct in 
												respect of the company&#8217;s 
												property.&#8221;</span></p>

												In the instant appeal after the 
												two defendants had discharged 
												their functions as officers of 
												the court and indeed their 
												appointment as Receivers and 
												Managers had been brought to an 
												end by the order of the court, 
												which I have already quoted 
												above, the plaintiff company, 
												having gained control over its 
												own affairs investigated the 
												management of its assets under 
												the defendants&#8217; control. Being 
												satisfied that the two receivers 
												and managers did mismanage the 
												company&#8217;s assets and 
												misappropriated some funds 
												belonging to the company the 
												plaintiff company filed a writ 
												against them for the recovery of 
												its lost assets. In spite of the 
												intervening appointment of 
												receiver and manager, who as 
												officers of the court took over 
												the management and control of 
												the assets of the company, the 
												constitutional right of the 
												shareholders of the plaintiff 
												company to take court action for 
												the recovery of their perceived 
												loss of a substantial part of 
												their assets remains intact. As 
												expressed earlier in this 
												judgment there is nothing in 
												section 239 of the Companies 
												Code, which takes away the 
												shareholders&#8217; right to pursue 
												their claim against the 
												defendants. The objection of the 
												second defendant/appellant on 
												grounds of lack of capacity of 
												the plaintiff company to sue the 
												defendants is without legal 
												basis. The appeal is therefore 
												dismissed.</span></p>
