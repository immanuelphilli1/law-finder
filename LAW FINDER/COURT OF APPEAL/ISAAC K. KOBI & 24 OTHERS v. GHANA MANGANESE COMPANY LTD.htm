						<span style="font-family: Arial">Before the 19th 
						May,1999, the plaintiffs/appellants herein enjoyed the 
						rights and privileges and performed the obligations that 
						attached to their respective positions as employees of 
						the defendant/respondent company.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The said date however 
						witnessed a monumental shift in their relationship and 
						drastically plunged them into an uncertain and shaken 
						future with their employers.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The significant event 
						of 19th May, 1999 was a demonstration or strike action 
						embarked upon by the workers. The actual event has been 
						variously described and qualified. While the workers of 
						the defendant company described it as peaceful, the 
						defendant company in official terms classified it as 
						violent. In the wake of the demonstration, the 
						respondent company took two significant steps. In the 
						first place they closed down the mines; and then after a 
						space of three and a half weeks or there about caused 
						the workers, or in any event, those of them who were 
						disposed to continue to be in the employment of the 
						respondent company to execute a &quot;declaration of renewal 
						of confidence and loyalty to GMC/MANAGEMENT&quot; as a 
						condition for re-opening of the mine. The said 
						declaration form which was dated on 31st May, 1999 was 
						tendered in evidence in the trial court as exhibit 'D'. 
						On the same date, a circular notice had been issued, 
						once again emanating from the respondent company, and 
						judging by its contents, a deduction can be made that it 
						preceded or was meant to forerun exhibit 'D'. For ease 
						of reference and effect, exhibit 'C' is hereby 
						reproduced in extract only.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;CIRCULAR. 31st May, 
						1999. Following the meeting held between the Ghana Mines 
						Workers Union, the Senior Staff Association Executives 
						and Management of the Ghana Manganese Company Limited, 
						at the request of the Ministry of Employment and Social 
						Welfare, on 31st May, 1999, Management wishes to inform 
						all workers that it has rescinded its decision to close 
						down the company and dismiss all the workers.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Consequently, workers 
						who wish to continue their employment with the Ghana 
						Manganese Company Limited and are prepared to abide by 
						the Rules and Regulations of the company are advised to 
						collect declaration forms between 10.00 hours and 17.00 
						hours each day from the District Labour Office at 
						Tarkwa, whose office is temporarily located at the Nsuta 
						Police Station.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">All such completed 
						declaration forms should be returned through the 
						District Labour Office for consideration not later than 
						10.00 hours on Thursday, 3rd June 1999.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Exhibit 'C' was signed 
						by the resident Director of the respondent company. 
						Evidence led before the trial Court by the Resident 
						Director on 13th December 2001 showed emphatically that 
						all but two of the entire workers of the respondent 
						company collected the forms and duly affirmed their 
						confidence in management and loyalty to the respondent 
						company. One is open to conjecture that those who did 
						not follow the procedure for the re-opening of the mines 
						automatically ended their service therein, and that 
						those who completed and returned the forms were to 
						continue in employment. This fact notwithstanding, the 
						employments of about twenty-eight of the workers, 
						including all the plaintiffs/appellants herein were 
						terminated. Each of them was served with a rejection 
						letter, and a certificate of service. The latter 
						provided the reason for leaving the service of the 
						respondents as &quot;Not re-admitted after closure of the 
						mine in May 1999.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The twenty-five 
						plaintiffs/appellants felt they had a common grievance 
						against their former employer, the respondent herein; 
						hence they filed an action in the High Court Registry at 
						Tarkwa to contest the rightfulness of the termination of 
						their appointments with the defendants/respondents. The 
						issues that went before the trial court were:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a)&nbsp; Whether or not 
						termination of Plaintiffs' appointment was wrongful 
						and/or illegal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b)&nbsp; Whether or not 
						Plaintiffs are entitled to their reliefs.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 
						plaintiffs/appellants, it should be pointed out, 
						prosecuted their claims severally albeit they all joined 
						together on one writ of summons as plaintiffs. This is 
						known to and in accordance with the procedure in the 
						courts in Ghana by virtue of Order 16 rule 1 of L.N. 
						140A. In such a situation, the rule provides for, and 
						actually enjoins the trial judge, to consider the 
						individual claims of each of the Plaintiffs and give 
						judgment &quot;for such one or more of the plaintiffs as may 
						be found to be entitled to relief, for such relief as he 
						or they may be entitled to.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At the trial the 1st, 
						22nd, 24th, 25, 6th, 4th, 11th, 15th and 16th plaintiffs 
						gave evidence on respect of their individual claims 
						while the 9th Plaintiff spoke for himself and on behalf 
						of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 13th, 
						14th, 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th, plaintiffs. None of the 
						plaintiff/appellants called any independent evidence 
						from a witness to support his or their case. Evidence 
						for the defendant/respondent was articulated through the 
						Respondent Director and two other witnesses.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At the end of the 
						trial, the Court dismissed the claims of the plaintiffs 
						because, as the judge found, the action was cognisable 
						under the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 
						1965 (Act 299) and that the said provisions rendered the 
						strike action illegal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 
						plaintiffs/applicants were obviously aggrieved by and 
						dissatisfied with the judgment and have hereby 
						translated their grievance into the herein appeal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As many as eight 
						grounds of appeal were filed. Counsel for the appellants 
						however compressed the grounds and concentrated on the 
						first two grounds only. These are:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; The judgment is 
						against the weight of the evidence adduced.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) The learned Trial 
						Judge wrongly dismissed the claim for damages for 
						defamation in the light of the evidence on record, hence 
						the suit should be remitted to the High Court for 
						consideration of the plaintiffs' claims on an individual 
						basis.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The thrust of the 
						appeal on the first ground, alleging that the judgment 
						was not supported by the evidence adduced at the trial, 
						is the statement of the trial judge dismissing the 
						action and attaching legality to termination of the 
						plaintiffs' employment by the defendants/respondents. 
						Counsel submitted that it was wrong for the trial court 
						to hold that all the employees became liable even though 
						not all of them took part in the demonstration. Indeed 
						it is on record, and the trial court found as a fact, 
						that some of the employees did not take part in the 
						demonstration. The evidence does not attribute any role, 
						whether as instigators, participants or the like to any 
						of them. The evidence shows that the 1st appellant was 
						on annual vacation leave; the 22nd appellant was heavily 
						pregnant and was preparing to proceed on maternity 
						leave. The 23rd appellant was on night shift and had 
						closed from work and gone home at the end of the shift 
						in the morning of 19th May, 1999. The 24th appellant 
						denied any involvement in the demonstration; for his 
						part the 6th appellant's evidence established that he 
						was not at the work premises at the time of the 
						disturbances because he was on afternoon duty and 
						appeared on the scene after the demonstration. The 4th 
						appellant was not present. He reported for work in the 
						afternoon.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 11th appellant was 
						on leave of absence from 17th May, 1999 to 16th June, 
						1999. The 15th appellant had reported sick on the 19th 
						May 1999 and was in no good condition of health to join 
						in the demonstration. The 16th appellant who was a nurse 
						in the respondent's service had worked in the night and 
						closed and left the premises of the respondent in the 
						morning of the 19th May, 1999. Counsel for the 
						appellants after referring to the above facts in 
						evidence submitted that the evidence on record shows 
						that the afore mentioned plaintiffs/appellants 
						had-committed none of the acts set out in section 23 of 
						Act.299 and to that extent cannot come under its 
						purview. Section 23 of Act 299 defines the word &quot;strike&quot; 
						to mean&quot; the act of any number of employees who are not 
						or have been in the employment of the same employer or 
						of different employers of&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a)&nbsp; discontinuing that 
						employment whether wholly or partially;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b)&nbsp; breaking their 
						contract of service;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) refusing or failing 
						after any such discontinuance to resume or return to 
						their employment;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d) refusing or failing 
						to accept engagement for any work in which they were or 
						are usually employed; or</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(e)&nbsp; reducing their 
						normal output or their normal rate of work&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have deemed it 
						relevant to reproduce the section above because the 
						parties relied on it depending on their interpretation, 
						and indeed the same section informed the judgment of the 
						trial court. Essentially, it is my view that this appeal 
						does not call for a determination of whether or not the 
						industrial action embarked upon was legal or illegal or 
						whether it was violent or peaceful. I should point out 
						without equivocation at this stage that the workers did 
						not have any prerogative of deciding whom the employer 
						should employ. This appeal, in my mind turns on whether 
						or not the appellants committed the acts for which they 
						have been jeopardised with a termination of appointment, 
						and whether the respondents had the power to terminate 
						their appointments as they did. It is my intention 
						therefore to consider the principal elements as 
						contained in the evidence. In the first place, none of 
						the appellants identified above, namely the 1st, 4th, 
						6th, 11th, 15th, 16th, 22nd, 23rd, 24th and 25th 
						appellants was challenged during their respective cross 
						examination by counsel for the respondents on their 
						specific denial of involvement in the strike action. The 
						law is quite succinct that where a party leads evidence 
						and his opponent fails to take him on, shake or puncture 
						the claims or allegations of fact he has made, then 
						there is a presumption in law that the opponent who has 
						failed to cross examine on the fact, has conceded that 
						the correctness of the fact alleged. On the other hand 
						where questions are asked during cross examination which 
						are not weighty enough to shake the evidence, or where 
						the answers to questions put during cross examination 
						show that the facts in issues are more probable than 
						not, then the court was bound to accept the facts as 
						true. In this case, I should reiterate that the failure 
						by the respondents to take the named appellants on, in 
						respect of their denial of participation in the strike 
						action for one reason or the other, is injurious to the 
						stand taken by the respondents and renders their action 
						in terminating the appointments of the said appellants 
						very worrying. The trial court rightly accepted that not 
						all of the workers took part in the strike action.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The second feature in 
						my analysis of the evidence and the basis of the 
						respondent's action against the appellants is in respect 
						of the testimony given by the Respondent Director of the 
						respondents in the trial court. He gave a bird's eye 
						view account of the events because he was an eye witness 
						and was positioned at a vantage point where he could 
						clearly see developments as they unfolded. Indeed luck 
						seemed to smile on him albeit in a daring manner when 
						some of the demonstrators marched to the Resident 
						Director's office and had exchanges with him. His 
						evidence was that the workers hid their identity by 
						wearing masks. The essential fact is, however, that the 
						Resident Director failed to identify any one of the 
						appellants as being among those who confronted him in 
						the office, neither did he attribute any specific act or 
						deed to any of them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Further to this, none 
						of those alleged by the Resident Director to have been 
						assaulted, or threatened, that is to say, the secretary 
						or the Human Resources Manager gave evidence to support 
						what the Resident director had alleged. The evidence of 
						the Secretary and/or the Human resources Manger was 
						necessary to show that the demonstration was violent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">More importantly, 
						either, if not both, of the witnesses might be in a 
						position to identify any or some of the plaintiffs as 
						having taken part in the demonstration. Such evidence 
						would expose and probably deflate the cloak of alibi 
						worn by the plaintiffs. Their evidence would be relevant 
						in the circumstances of this case since it cannot be 
						said that they were coming to merely repeat what the 
						Resident Director had said and would therefore be 
						otiose, neither derogating from nor advancing the 
						evidence already on record any further. See ASARE vrs. 
						DONKOR and SERWAH II (1962) 2 GLR. 176 Conversely, there 
						'is no suggestion in this appeal turning on knowledge on 
						the part of the respondents that the interests of the 
						said witnesses were at variance with those of the 
						respondents and were therefore not likely to testify on 
						their behalf&#8212;See ABADOO vrs. AWOTWI [1973] 1 GLR.393. I 
						am nevertheless mindful that the uncorroborated evidence 
						of the Resident Director, if it meets other legal 
						requirements for the discharge of the burden, can be 
						relied upon as sufficient to base a finding of fact 
						upon. In this case however, the evidence of the Resident 
						Director in issue falls short of the legal requirements, 
						and as it stands, is too porous and dangerous to justify 
						any allegation of ill- conduct by the appellants.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Lastly, I intend to 
						consider the minutes of the meeting held under the 
						auspices of the DWI who, at the material time was Deputy 
						Minister for Employment and Social Welfare. It is 
						essential, to also analyse exhibit 'C' (supra) and, may 
						be, the steps taken in to effectuate the termination of 
						the appointment of the appellants.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The final agreement at 
						the meeting held in the Ministry of Employment and 
						Social Welfare as recorded in exhibit '2' was . . . . . 
						. . . . . . that Management would come out with a form 
						on which the conditions of the re-entry to the company 
						would be spelt out&nbsp;&nbsp; ....... 'The Respondent Company 
						subsequently issued exhibit 'C' (supra) wherein they 
						assured the workers that as a fall out from the meeting 
						evidenced by exhibit 2 (supra) Management had &quot;rescinded 
						its decision to close down the company and dismiss all 
						the workers&quot;. This raises a presumption that none of the 
						workers including those who planned and those who 
						actually took part in the demonstration was going to be 
						penalised or victimised. Management was then seen to be 
						exercising a prerogative of pardon across board and 
						unconditionally. If therefore it was still deemed 
						necessary to penalise any or some of the employees for 
						their part in the industrial action then the law 
						requires that such action on the part of the Respondents 
						must be founded on reasonably justifiable ground and not 
						arbitrary. The question that comes up therefore is, 
						whether the Respondents' termination of the appellants 
						can pass the test of substantial evidence. Were the 
						appellants made escape goats merely to tell the world at 
						large that the Respondents can bite and really bite 
						hard. Where the termination of the appellants cannot be 
						reasonably justified under the substantial evidence 
						test, then that conduct cannot be held in law to be 
						legal. The substantial evidence rule was stated in 
						MARSHALL vrs. CONSUMERS POWER CO. 65 Mich. App.237 as 
						such evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as 
						adequate to support a conclusion. It is that quality of 
						evidence necessary for a court to affirm a decision of 
						an administrative board. Under the &quot;substantial evidence 
						rule&quot; reviewing courts would defer to an agency 
						determination so long as, upon an examination of the 
						whole record there is substantial evidence upon which 
						the agency could reasonably base its decision.&quot; Have the 
						respondents herein made any reasonable ground on which 
						their termination of the appointments of the appellants, 
						can be justified. Relying upon the facts alone I do not 
						think so.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Before I am accused of 
						not dealing with the individual cases of the appellants, 
						I must hasten to add that the 22nd, 23rd, 24th and 25th 
						appellants were senior staff and were deemed not to be 
						part of a demonstration that had been called and 
						executed by the unionised staff. It would appear, and I 
						shudder to mention the irony of circumstance in this 
						case. It is patent upon the evidence that the executive 
						members of both the Senior Staff Association and the 
						Local Mine Workers Union assisted the Management 
						immensely in all the meetings and deliberations leading 
						to the reopening of the mines. It appears however that 
						the axe rather fell on them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">From the above 
						reappraisal of the evidence I firmly agree with Counsel 
						for appellants' contention that the trial court's 
						judgment is against the weight of the evidence led.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The above 
						consideration, so far relates to the facts and evidence 
						led No firm decision can however be made on this one 
						sided consideration. The other equally relevant issue in 
						this appeal is to find and establish the nature of the 
						action that was taken by the respondents. It is beyond 
						dispute that the appointments of the appellant were 
						terminated. The severance of the appointments of the 
						appellants needs to be put into a strait jacket. Cleary 
						their severance of employment was not a summary 
						dismissal but a termination of appointment. Without the 
						need to quote any legal authorities, it is common 
						knowledge that clear distinctions exist between the two. 
						I will only attempt to note the commonest. While in 
						summary dismissals the employer may state reasons for 
						their action, the employer is not equally bound to give 
						any reason for termination of appointment. Besides this, 
						an employee whose service was to be terminated was 
						entitled to notice or payment in lieu thereof, and also 
						payment of all his entitlements.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This was the position 
						taken by this court in ARYEE vrs STATE CONSTRUCTION 
						CORPORATION [1984-86] 1 GLR.424. In that case the 
						appellant's appointment was terminated on grounds of his 
						misconduct in conspiring with another person to 
						discredit the corporation in a local newspaper, and 
						after he had apologised to his employers after a sober 
						reflection, he subsequently wrote to the President of 
						the Ghana with copies to some of the Ministers, and in 
						that letter he virtually repeated the allegations and 
						insinuations which he had earlier withdrawn and 
						apologised for.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">When his appointment 
						was terminated, he was given physical payment in lieu of 
						notice together with other entitlements. The Court held 
						inter alia.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(1) a contract of 
						service was not a contract of serutude. To say, as we 
						are wont to do, that it gave rise to a master-servant 
						relationship was to distort reality . . . . . . . . . . 
						.&nbsp; The contract was framed in such a way that either 
						party might bring it to an end and free himself from the 
						relationship painlessly. In this case, the appellant 
						could, at anytime, give the relevant three months' 
						notice or forfeit an equivalent in salary and leave the 
						corporation without justifying his action to the 
						corporation. In the same way the corporation need not 
						assign away reason for choosing to terminate their 
						contract with the defendant. The contract merely 
						required the corporation to give three months' notice or 
						its equivalent in salary and their conduct be perfectly 
						in order. On the evidence, the corporation discharged 
						that obligation by giving the appellant three months' 
						pay in lie of notice. In the event, the termination was 
						perfectly in accordance with the contract of service and 
						could not be wrongful. The corporation misled the 
						appellant, and perhaps the court below, by seeking to 
						state the reasons for its action. It did not need to do 
						that. The fact that it did, however, did not detract in 
						anyway from the general Validity of their action, 
						expressly stated to have been taken under Paragraph 56 
						(c) of the contract of employment.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Article 10'02 of the 
						Collective Agreement Between Ghana Manganese Company 
						Limited and the Ghana Mine workers Union of the TUC 
						(Ghana) of 8th June, 1996, confers power on the employer 
						to terminate the employment of any worker by giving due 
						notice or payment in lieu thereof. Once the required 
						length of notice or its equivalence in money has been 
						paid to the affected employee, termination is deemed 
						legal and complete, irrespective of the fact that no 
						reason, or wrong or unsatisfactory reason has been 
						given. In this appeal therefore, the unsatisfactory 
						reason for the termination of the appointments of the 
						plaintiffs severally, would in the final analysis not 
						make the termination wrongful or illegal. The respective 
						letters of rejection given to each of the 
						plaintiffs/appellants and tendered into evidence clearly 
						show that all their entitlements were duly paid to them. 
						The respondents cannot be faulted, neither is there any 
						good reason to disturb the conclusions of the trial 
						court, since in this case none of the appellants has 
						questions the basis of the calculation of the monetary 
						entitlements paid to them. Even though the respondents 
						did not lead sufficient or satisfactory evidence why the 
						appellants and not any of the other employees had their 
						appointments terminated, they have the legal right qua 
						employers to dispense with any worker whenever they felt 
						his service were no longer required, and no court can 
						challenge that decision and act once the necessary 
						payments had been made.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Upon the evidence, not 
						much moment was placed on the claim for damages for 
						defamation by the appellants. Indeed apart from the 1st 
						plaintiff/appellant who asserted before the trial Court 
						that his office as Assembly man had been ridiculed, none 
						of the rest of the appellants touched on that leg of 
						claim. There being no evidence to support defamation, it 
						is my view that the trial judge was right in not 
						pronouncing on it. Counsel for the appellants did not 
						substantially address the issue of defamation in his 
						argument and submissions before us.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The words &quot;Not 
						re-admitted after closure of the mine in May, 1999&quot; per

						after a certain date and occurrence.</span></p>
