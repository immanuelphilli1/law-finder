						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the 13th of December 
						2002, the High Court entered judgment in favour of the 
						plaintiff against the defendant upon an application for 
						summary judgment under Order 14 of the High Court Civil 
						Rules as amended by L.I. 1129.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Court granted all 
						the reliefs endorsed on the writ of summons and 
						statement of claim. It is against this decision that the 
						defendant lodged this appeal in this Court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In order to appreciate 
						the issues raised, I deem it necessary to set out in 
						brief the events culminating in this appeal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the 17th of July 
						2002, the plaintiff took out a writ of summons claiming 
						against the defendant the sum of $5400 being money the 
						defendant collected from the plaintiffs on the grounds 
						of securing them a United States visa but which he 
						failed to do.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Interest on the said 
						amount from 1st December, 2001 to date of judgment. In 
						the accompanying statement of claim the plaintiff 
						averred that the defendant collected a total amount of 
						$5400 from him in order to secure for him a visa; that 
						when the defendant gave him the passport and he 
						attempted to travel with same, it was detected that the 
						visa was fake. He therefore asked for a refund of the 
						monies paid.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the 23rd of 
						September, 2002 the defendant filed a defence; the gist 
						of which was that there was an agreement between him and 
						the plaintiffs under which he was to procure a passport, 
						an American visa, a ticket and other charges at a total 
						cost of $6000; the breakdown being $3000 for the visa, 
						$100 for the passport, $1500 for the ticket, hotel and 
						service charges amounting to $1400. In all he received 
						$3414 and ¢500,000. According to him he had refunded an 
						amount of $1,300 to the plaintiff and was therefore not 
						entitled to the sum stated on the face of the writ.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the 13th of 
						November, 2002 the plaintiff filed an application for 
						summary judgment under order 14 of the High Court Rules 
						as amended by L.I. 1129 for the sum of $5400 together 
						with interest; an affidavit in opposition was filed 
						virtually restating the averments in the decision filed.
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the 13th of December 
						2002, the learned Judge gave his decision in these terms 
						&#8220;Upon hearing learned Counsel and reading the affidavit 
						in support of the motion and reading through the 
						affidavit in opposition the application is granted as 
						prayed. Costs of 2 Million Cedis awarded against the 
						defendant.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendant grounded 
						his attack against the decision on these 2 grounds: [a] 
						that the judgment cannot be supported by the plaintiff&#8217;s 
						claim with regard to the defence filed by the 
						defendants. [b] The defendant was not heard by the Court 
						before judgment was given.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Learned Counsel for the 
						defendant submitted that the learned judge fell into an 
						error when he entered judgment for the full amount even 
						though it was clear from the defence filed that the 
						defendant had refunded an amount of $800 dollars before 
						the said judgment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He further argued that 
						since the defendant averred in both his defence and 
						affidavit in opposition that he did incur some 
						legitimate expenses which he was entitled to deduct and 
						of which averment there was no denial, triable issues 
						were raised and the defendant ought to have been given 
						leave to defend.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the indorsement to 
						the writ, the plaintiff claimed the sum of $5,400 
						together with interest and asserted in the accompanying 
						writ of summons and statement of claim that they 
						represented monies paid to the defendant for the 
						purposes of securing him a visa to the United States of 
						America.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">According to the 
						plaintiff the visa which the defendant subsequently 
						handed over to him was fake and hence the refund.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the defence, the 
						defendant did not essentially deny having received the 
						sum stated in the indorsement but claimed it represented 
						part payment for various services, which he was to 
						render for the plaintiff. According to him he charged 
						the sum of $6000 for the services to be provided which 
						included a ticket, a passport, a visa and a hotel 
						accommodation and that since he performed all the 
						services with the exception of the visa which the 
						plaintiff alleged was fake, he was entitled to deduct 
						his legitimate expenses from the sum claimed. It was his 
						case that he had refunded an amount of $800 at the 
						relevant time and therefore amount appearing on the face 
						of the writ was not accurate.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The statement of 
						defence was filed on the 23rd of September, 2002. In the 
						said defence 2 issues were raised: [1] that the 
						defendant had refunded part of the money [2] that he had 
						pleaded the defence of a set off.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In paragraph 6 of the 
						defence the defendant averred that he had refunded $800 
						out the amount, significantly this averment was not 
						denied. It is trite learning that any allegation of 
						fact, which is not traversed, is deemed admitted. If 
						indeed the defendant had refunded part of the amount, it 
						is clear that judgment could not properly have been 
						entered for the amount stated on the face of the writ, 
						for it is settled that where judgment is entered for an 
						amount greater than what is actually due; it must be set 
						aside ex debito justiciae; Halsbury&#8217; Laws of England 4th 
						edition Vol. 26 paragraph 559. This position was 
						restated in Morkor vrs. Kuma 1998-99 SC. GLR page 620 
						where it was held inter alia that this was apart from 
						any consideration of whether or not the defendant has a 
						good defence on the merits. More importantly the issue 
						which confronts me in this appeal, is whether the 
						learned Judge rightly exercised his discretion in 
						entering judgment for all the reliefs and thereby 
						refusing the defendant leave to defend.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Order 14 of the High 
						Court Civil Procedure Rules as amended provides the 
						procedure for obtaining summary judgment without 
						proceeding to a full trial. It is a means of 
						expeditiously disposing of cases, which are virtually 
						uncontested, and thereby avoiding a full trail with its 
						attendant delays.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Among the conditions 
						precedent for a plaintiff employing the summary process 
						are [1 the defendant must have entered appearance [2. 
						The statement of claim must have been served on the 
						defendant [3 and relevant for our purposes, the 
						affidavit in support must contain a statement of the 
						deponent&#8217;s belief that there is no defence to the claim 
						or part thereof in respect of which the application is 
						made.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff must 
						therefore proceed under Order 14 only on grounds that 
						the defendant has no defence to the claim since 
						evidently the purpose is to enable a plaintiff obtain 
						summary judgment where he can prove his claim clearly 
						and if the defendant is unable to set up a bonafide 
						defence or raise on issue against the claim which ought 
						to be heard.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the case under 
						consideration, the defendant did essentially admit part 
						of the claim; made a refund but however asserted that he 
						was entitled to deduct his legitimate expenses. That he 
						could not be said to have clearly admitted owing the 
						whole amount stated in the endorsement and therefore a 
						full trial was unnecessary is evident; nonetheless the 
						learned Judge entered judgment in favour of the 
						plaintiff for the full amount. I am of the view that the 
						learned Judge fell into an error for it is trite 
						learning that where part of a claim is clearly due by 
						admission or otherwise, while a defence is shown as to 
						the residue, the Court should enter judgment for the sum 
						due and give leave to defend as to the residue. Lazarus 
						vrs. Smith 1908 2KB 266.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Since the defendant 
						admitted and proceeded to make a refund with respect to 
						part of the claim and pleaded the defence of a set-off, 
						triable issues were raised and he ought to have been 
						given leave to defend with regard to the reside. Indeed 
						both the defence and the affidavit in opposition clearly 
						articulated what the defence was. The appeal accordingly 
						succeeds on this ground. With regard to the 22nd 
						ground-namely that the defendant was not heard, learned 
						Council submitted that judgment was given in the absence 
						of both the defendant and his counsel without hearing 
						notices being served on them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A look at record of 
						proceedings shows that the summons for summary judgment 
						was filed on 13/11/2002 and fixed for hearing at 
						9.0&#8217;clock on 2nd December, 2002. It is evident from the 
						record that both the defendant and his counsel were 
						absent on the 2nd of December, 2002. The Court, it 
						appears did not make any order for hearing notices to be 
						served on them after having adjourned the hearing of the 
						application to the 9th of December 2002.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Somehow the defendant 
						must have gotten wind of the date, for he did surface in 
						court on the adjourned date. The entries made by the 
						learned Judge on the 9th of December 2002 attested to 
						this fact. There was nothing on record to show that the 
						defendant&#8217;s counsel was in court. The matter was again 
						adjourned to the 13th of December 2002. Both the 
						defendant and his counsel were however absent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Even though the Court 
						failed to make an order for hearing notices to be served 
						on the defendant and his counsel on the 2nd of December, 
						the fact that the defendant was in court on the 9th 
						albeit without his counsel was indicative of the fact 
						that he had notice of the proceedings slated for the 
						9th. It could be argued that since the Court failed to 
						make an order that they be notified of the hearing date 
						the proceedings heard in their absence were a nullity. 
						As noted the defendant was in court and was therefore 
						aware of the adjourned date i.e. the 13th, it was 
						therefore incumbent upon him not only to be in court but 
						also to have duly informed his counsel of the hearing 
						date. When therefore the defendant chose to absent 
						himself from court despite the fact that he was aware of 
						the date, can be heard to complain that he was not given 
						a hearing? I think not.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">If he had not been in 
						court on the 9th of December when the matter was 
						adjourned to the 13th, in the absence of an order for 
						service of notices on them they could have successfully 
						argued that they were not notified of the proceedings 
						and therefore not given a hearing. A party who has had 
						notice of impending proceedings but nonetheless chooses 
						to be elsewhere cannot be heard to complain that he was
