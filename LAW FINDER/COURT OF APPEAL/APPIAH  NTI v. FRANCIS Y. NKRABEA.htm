						<span style="font-family: Arial">ESSILFIE-BONDZIE, J.A.:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is an appeal from 
						the decision of the Circuit Court Accra dated 10th April 
						1997.&nbsp; The judgment dismissed the plaintiff claim for an 
						order for ejectment from and recovery of possession of 
						H/No. A383/20 Dansoman Estates Accra the plaintiff&#8217;s 
						claim for Mense Profits was also dismissed. The 
						defendant however obtained judgment against the 
						plaintiff on his counter-claim.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff is the 
						maternal uncle of the defendant.&nbsp; The defendant who is 
						resident in Germany wrote to the plaintiff some time in 
						1981 and his elder sister that they should find him 
						accommodation at home. The plaintiff then an employee of 
						Ghana Broad-casting Corporation had acquired from the 
						State Housing Corporation a housing unit at Dansoman and 
						was paying by installment on monthly basis.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Upon the receipt of the 
						letter the plaintiff decided to give the said Dansoman 
						house to his nephew (the defendant) because he had built 
						a new house at North Kaneshie.&nbsp; In his letter offering 
						the Dansoman house to him the plaintiff asked the latter 
						to send him ¢5,000.00 for the construction of a 
						reservoir in the house since water was very scarce in 
						Dansoman.&nbsp; The defendant directed the plaintiff to a 
						sister who gave ¢5,000.00 to the plaintiff on his 
						behalf.&nbsp; On the receipt of the ¢5,000.00 from the 
						defendant the plaintiff did not use the money for the 
						construction of a reservoir again but used the money to 
						pay off the outstanding price of the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; As agreed 
						the plaintiff moved to his new house at North Kaneshie 
						in early January, 1982. The defendant came down and 
						lived in the said Dansoman house at an agreed rent.&nbsp; 
						After some time the plaintiff requested for vacant 
						possession.&nbsp; In paragraphs 3 of his statement of claim, 
						the plaintiff pleaded as follows</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(3) The plaintiff on 
						or about January, 1993 gave the defendant notice to quit 
						and deliver the said premises to the plaintiff for the 
						personal occupation of the plaintiff by 31st August, 
						1993.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As on the 6th January, 
						1994 when the plaintiff issued his writ of summons 
						against him the defendant had not vacated the premises 
						hence the reliefs claimed in the action.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this appeal the 
						plaintiff/appellant (who will hereinafter be referred to 
						as the appellant) has challenged the judgment of the 
						trial court as contained in the NOTICE OF APPEAL on the 
						following grounds.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) The Trial Judge 
						erred in law by holding that the defendant/respondent is 
						a joint owner of plaintiff/appellant's house No. A 
						383/20 at Dansoman and thereby giving defendant the 
						right to stay but perpetually in plaintiff/appellant's 
						said house and directing plaintiff only to pay visits to 
						the House.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) The Trial Judge's 
						judgment was wrong in law and was one sided for the 
						evaluation of the relevant evidence given at the trial 
						for his consideration and this has occasioned discourage 
						of justice.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) The Trial Judge 
						misdirected himself by refusing to consider the effect 
						of plaintiff/ appellant's senility, pension, dwindled 
						income and paucity of means as reasonable grounds for 
						claiming recovery of his premises rented to the 
						defendant/respondent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d) The Trial Judge was 
						palpably in error when in the face of the 
						defendant/respondent&#8217;s own admission he gave a 
						refundable financial help of ¢5,000.00 to the 
						plaintiff/appellant, the judge nevertheless concluded 
						that money debt was money held in constructure trust by 
						plaintiff/appellant for the defendant/respondent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In dismissing the 
						appellant's claim for recovery of possession the learned 
						trial judge made the following findings his judgment:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Plaintiff has failed 
						to prove to the satisfaction of the court that he 
						reasonably needs vacant possession for his personal 
						occupation. The fact that plaintiff owns this house is 
						not enough proof, the court can not therefore make an 
						order in this case and therefore plaintiff claim based 
						on (SIC) personal possession fails.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He also said</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The plaintiff also 
						says that defendant is in arrears of rent, defendant is 
						on record as having said that he has been paying his 
						rent at the Rent Control Office ever since he and 
						plaintiff appeared there some time in 1993.&nbsp; This has 
						not been denied by the plaintiff.&nbsp; It is different thing 
						if the plaintiff has been refusing to go for his money.&nbsp; 
						But certainly the defendant cannot be said to be in 
						arrears of rent since by his assertion (that) he has 
						been making payments into court. Plaintiff's claim for 
						arrears of rent is not tenable.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After a careful 
						scrutiny of the record of proceedings, I am satisfied 
						that there are enough evidence on record to support the 
						findings and the decision of the learned trial judge to 
						dismiss the appellant&#8217;s claim in its entirety.&nbsp;&nbsp; For it 
						is now settled that the appellate court would not 
						disturb the findings of fact made by&nbsp; a trial court 
						unless there is no evidence to support such findings or 
						there is no basis for the court's decision.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is my view that the 
						appeal against the dismissal of the appellant claim was 
						misconceived.&nbsp; This view point, was conceded by learned 
						counsel for the appellant when he abandoned grounds (b) 
						and (c) in the notice of appeal which implied that the 
						appellant had withdrawn his appeal against the dismissal 
						of his claim as endorsed on the writ of summons.&nbsp; It was 
						a wise decision and the court endorses it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The remaining grounds 
						of appeal on the notice of appeal after the withdrawal 
						of grounds (b) and (c) are grounds (a) and (b) which 
						challenged the judgment obtained by the 
						defendant/respondent (who will hereinafter also be 
						referred to as the respondent) on his counter-claim. A 
						look at the appellant written submission by his counsel 
						indicates that the appeal was solely against the trial 
						judge&#8217;s decision on the respondents counter-claim.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In his counter-claim 
						the respondent was claiming the following:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) A DECLARATION that 
						in the light of the plaintiff&#8217;s own self-confession that 
						(he plaintiff) had used or diverted the defendant's 
						money of ¢5,000.00 (five thousand cedis) from the 
						construction of an agreed reservoir into payment for the 
						full purchase price of Estate house having the present 
						House number A383/20, 1st Close Dansoman Estate Accra 
						then worth ¢5,800.00 (five thousand eight hundred cedis), 
						the defendant by operation of the equitable destrine of 
						Tracing became an equitable Joint Owner of the property 
						with an undivided share of ¢5,000.00/5,800.00 to 
						defendant and also with a Heritable Right of 
						Survivorship to EITHER PARTY and that by reason of such 
						equitable joint ownership the plaintiff's demand for 
						immediate possession must be refused and substituted for 
						or with an order that Defendant shall maintain the 
						plaintiff with a reason- able sum of money every month 
						for life.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) PERPETUAL 
						INJUNCTION . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The import of the 
						counter-claim is that the respondent was asking for a 
						declaration that he was a joint owner of the House 
						subject of the suit. The record shows that the 
						respondent based his claim, on the evidence of the 
						appellant that when he decided to rent his house to the 
						respondent for a rent of ¢3,000,00 a month, he wrote the 
						respondent asking him to send him ¢5,000.00 for the 
						construction of a reservoir in the house as water&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						was scarce in Dansoman.&nbsp; The respondent (and sent they 
						requested.)&nbsp; On the receipt of the ¢5,000.00, according 
						to the appellant&#8217;s own admission he did not use the 
						money for the construction of the reservoir but used it 
						to pay balance on his house.&nbsp; It was therefore the 
						respondent's contention that since the appellants had 
						used the ¢5,000.00 in the payment of the substantial 
						part of the purchase price of the house he is a joint 
						owner of the house.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The evidence tendered 
						by the respondent shows that he went to live in the 
						appellant&#8217;s Dansoman house in 1981 as a tenant.&nbsp; This 
						was after he had sent the ¢5,000.00 to the appellant to 
						assist him to build a reservoir.&nbsp; He paid the rent of 
						¢300.00 until as a result of a complaint he lodged with 
						the Rent Officer, the rent was reduced from ¢300 to 
						¢150.&nbsp; He continued to pay this rent until 14th January, 
						1994 when the appellant instituted an action to eject 
						him from the house.&nbsp; The evidence reveals that until 
						1994 the respondent never made any claim that he was a 
						joint owner of the house he was occupying as a tenant.&nbsp; 
						Under cross-examination by counsel for the appellant the 
						respondent admitted that he gave the ¢5,000.00 to the 
						appellant as a loan.&nbsp; He said as follows under 
						cross-examination.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Q. Was the money you 
						gave the plaintiff a loan</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp; It was a loan.&nbsp; He 
						wanted to get the money.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q. Since you came back 
						from Germany have you demanded a refund of the loan.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp; I have not demanded 
						a refund.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Now if the respondent 
						himself has admitted that he had lived in the house not 
						only as a tenant who paid rent from 1981 to 1994 but has 
						also admitted that the ¢5,000.00 he gave the appellant 
						sometime before 1981 was a loan where then was the 
						evidence on which the learned trial judge relied to 
						conclude that the respondent is entitled to an equitable 
						interest in the house by way of joint ownership &quot;and he 
						must be given it as he is entitled to it&quot; the respondent 
						did not say that he asked the appellant to use the money 
						to buy the house for him. So even if the appellant had 
						admitted that he diverted the money which he had asked 
						of defendant for the construction of a reservoir to pay 
						off the hire-purchase on the house, that ipso facto 
						would not make the respondent a joint owner of the 
						house.&nbsp; There was no bases for giving the respondent 
						judgment on his counter-claim and I so hold.&nbsp; Since the 
						appellant has not denied receiving ¢5,000.00 from the 
						respondent the latter's remedy is to sue for the 
						recovery of the said amount with interest from the date 
						it was received.&nbsp; It is my judgment that the learned 
						judged erroneously came to the conclusion that the 
						respondent is part owner of the house.&nbsp; The judgment 
						given in favour of the respondent on his counter-claim 
						is set aside.&nbsp; And the appeal is allowed.</span></p>

						<span style="font-family: Arial">AFREH, J. A.: </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I also agree that the 
						appeal should be allowed and I only want to say a few 
						things mainly about the question of constructive trust.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellant claims 
						against the respondent ejectment from and recovery 
						possession of H/No. A 383/20, Dansoman Estates, Accra 
						and Mensa Profits. The simple facts of the case are that 
						the respondent after several years sojourn in Germany 
						decided sometime in 1981 to return home for good.&nbsp; He 
						wrote the appellant, who was the uterine brother of 
						defendant&#8217;s mother, about accommodation.&nbsp; As it happened 
						the appellant was preparing to quit his house in 
						Dansoman, the house in dispute, for a bigger house in 
						Kaneshie.&nbsp; He offered to rent it to the defendant.&nbsp; The 
						offer was accepted and a rent of ¢300.00 a month was 
						agreed.&nbsp; The defendant returned home on 9th December, 
						1981.&nbsp; He stayed for a few weeks with the plaintiff at 
						Dansoman before the plaintiff moved to his new house at 
						Kaneshie.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">For a few years 
						relations between uncle and nephew were cordial.&nbsp; Then 
						it soured&#8212;about rent, the defendant&#8217;s desire to install 
						burglar-proof, enjoyment of fruit trees in the house, 
						and other matters.&nbsp; The plaintiff took the defendant to 
						the rent office to recover his house.&nbsp; The defendant in 
						turn asked for reduction in rent, which he claimed, the 
						rent officer granted.&nbsp; Apparently, the plaintiff was not 
						satisfied with the performance of the rent office, so he 
						did not pursue the matter there.&nbsp; Instead he instituted 
						proceedings in the Circuit Court.&nbsp;&nbsp; After a trial 
						lasting about 18 months the court presided over by Mr. 
						(now Justice) B. O. Tetteh gave judgment in favour of 
						the defendant.&nbsp; It is from this judgment that the 
						instant appeal has been brought.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Of the four grounds of 
						appeal the most important is the first ground and I 
						intend to deal mainly with it in this judgment.&nbsp; It 
						reads:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The Trial Judge erred 
						in law by holding that The defendant/respondent is a 
						joint owner of plaintiff/appellant&#8217;s house No. A 383/20 
						at Dansoman and thereby giving defendant the right to 
						&#8220;stay put perpetually, in plaintiff/appellant&#8217;s said 
						house and directing plaintiff only to pay visits to the 
						house&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">From the evidence on 
						record, and especially the evidence of the respondent 
						himself there can be no doubt that the money given by 
						the respondent to the appellant was intended to be a 
						refundable financial assistance or, simply, a loan.&nbsp; It 
						is also clear from the evidence of the respondent what 
						the money was intended for.&nbsp; He testified inter alia:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;In (plaintiff's) 
						letter, he said I should bring him (plaintiff) money 
						about ¢5000.00; and that he was going to use ¢4,000.00 
						to defray the remaining cost of the Dansoman house. 
						Plaintiff said he bought the premises for ¢6,000.00 in 
						1971.&nbsp; And that as at 1981, he had only paid ¢2,000.00 
						remaining ¢4,000.00 to be paid to the Housing 
						Corporation; and that ¢1,000.00 would be used for the 
						construction of a reservoir for me. I asked plaintiff to 
						contact my elder sister for that amount because I had an 
						account with her. I returned home on 9th December, 
						1981.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He also emphasised in 
						his evidence that the only portion of the money the 
						plaintiff misapplied was ¢1,000.00. When asked 
						&quot;According to you plaintiff has not misapplied the 
						¢4,000.00&quot; he answered &quot;No&quot;. The judge therefore 
						seriously erred when he held or thought the plaintiff 
						had misapplied ¢5,000.00 since it was at complete 
						variance with the evidence before him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was also totally 
						wrong for the judge to impose a constructive trust on 
						the plaintiff in respect of the ¢4,000.00.&nbsp; It was a 
						simple loan to the plaintiff for his own use, that is, 
						to pay off the remainder of the purchase price for the 
						house.&nbsp; He made that clear to the defendant and the 
						defendant agreed to lend the money to him on that 
						basis.&nbsp; It is difficult to see how any type of 
						trust&#8212;express, secret, implied, resulting or 
						constructive or whatever can arise in such 
						circumstances.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is difficult to 
						understand the basis on which a constructive trust could 
						be established in respect of the ¢1,000.00. The 
						plaintiff said he needed it to build a reservoir for the 
						house at Dansoman because at that time there was lack of 
						water in the area. But, according to the trial judge's 
						own finding &quot;later on he got to know that&nbsp; the water was 
						still very scarce. So he abandoned the whole idea of the 
						construction of the reservoir&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The respondent himself 
						described the ¢1,000.00 as a financial assistance or 
						loan. It is clear from the evidence on record that the 
						appellant did not conceal his decision to abandon the 
						construction of the reservoir, and the reasons therefor, 
						from the respondent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The respondent agreed 
						to go and stay in the house without the reservoir. He 
						stayed therefore 12years without asking for the return 
						of the ¢1,000.00 or complaining that the appellant had 
						cheated him by failing to construct the reservoir.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The respondent claimed 
						that the appellant undertook to build a reservoir for 
						him but failed to do so and that was why he was claiming 
						to be a joint owner of the house. He was wrong. The 
						appellant never undertook to construct a reservoir for 
						respondent. His intention was to construct a reservoir 
						for the house which belonged to him. The reservoir was 
						intended to be a permanent part of the house.&nbsp; If it had 
						been built it would have belonged to the appellant alone 
						because it would have been part of a house he owned 
						alone.&nbsp; The defendant would have had no proprietary 
						interest, legal or equitable, in it.&nbsp; In failing to 
						build it he did nothing unconscionable that would make 
						equity to impose any form of trust, including 
						constructive trust, on him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It has been said that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;the constructive trust 
						imposed by law is not capable of precise definition and 
						is continually developing.&nbsp; For the present it is 
						sufficient to say that a constructive trust is a trust, 
						which is imposed by equity in order to satisfy the 
						demands of justice and good conscience&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">See Snell's Equity 29th 
						Edition (1990) at, 192. The fact that it is developing 
						does not mean that every failure to fulfil a promise or 
						breach of contract should lead to the imposition of a 
						constructive trust.&nbsp; The circumstance that may give use 
						to constructive trust are now well-known and established 
						and should not be added to without strong reasons.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A constructive trust 
						may arise:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(i)&nbsp; where a trustee or 
						person in a fiduciary position makes an Unauthorised 
						profit from the trust or his position;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(ii) Where a person not 
						being appointed a trustee knowingly and wrongfully 
						receives Trust property or assist others to do so, and</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(iii)&nbsp; Where a person 
						is guilty of personal fraud.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(iv) It may also arise 
						where a specifically enforceable contract for the sale 
						of land is made. The purchaser becomes the owner of the 
						land in equity and the vendor becomes a constructive 
						trustee for the purchaser.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(v) Also a mortgage who 
						holds a surplus in his hands after selling the mortgaged 
						property under his power of sale may become trustee of 
						the surplus.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In many jurisdictions 
						the constructive trust has been used as a remedy for 
						many cases of unjust enrichment. This may be a good 
						idea. But for the movement it may be prudent for us to 
						follow the approach in England where:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The constructive trust 
						has in general remained essentially a substantive; 
						institution ownership must not be confused with 
						obligation, nor must the relationship of debtor and 
						creditor be converted into one of trustee and cestui que 
						trustee&quot;(Emphasis mine)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">See Snell's Equity 29th 
						Edition p. 197.&nbsp; I have underlined the last part of this 
						quotation because it is so apt in this case: the judge 
						converted the relationship of debtor and creditor into 
						one of trustee and cestui que trust. And that was wrong.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The judge failed 
						adequately to consider the appellant's defense to the 
						respondent's counter claim.&nbsp; The most formidable was the 
						defence that the claim was statute-barred or that the 
						defend had slept too long on his rights. He admitted in 
						evidence that he never demanded a refund of the loan he 
						gave to the appellant.&nbsp; Indeed it was not until after 
						the appellant had started to give evidence in the court 
						below that it occurred to the respondent defendant to 
						make a counter claim in respect of the ¢5,000.00 of all 
						things he claimed an equitable remedy a claim to the 
						house as a joint owner, what the judge called tracing.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my opinion it was a 
						spurious and stale claim and the judge should have 
						dismissed it as completely unmeritorious.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As for the order of 
						tracing there were no grounds for it. There was no 
						property of the defendant's in the hands of the 
						plaintiff, in identifiable form, for the defendant to 
						follow or trace. At worst the plaintiff only owed the 
						defendant a sum of money defendant freely lent to the 
						plaintiff.&nbsp; The remedy for it is a simple action for 
						debt, not a claim for a half interest in a house the 
						plaintiff had owned several years before the debt 
						arose.&nbsp;&nbsp; The house was not bought with trust money of 
						which the respondent was the beneficiary. It was not 
						acquired by the plaintiff in circumstances where in 
						equity he should have acquired it for the defendant, the 
						plaintiff had acquired it about twenty years before he 
						asked defendant to lend him ¢4,000.00 to enable him to 
						pay off the remainder of the purchase price. The 
						defendant therefore had no basis, in law and equity, to 
						claim any propriety interest in the house.&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff was never 
						the constructive trustee of the money the defendant lent 
						to him; the defendant never acquired any interest in the 
						house because appellant failed to construct a water 
						reservoir as he had intended to do with the ¢1,000.00; 
						and the defendant never became and is not a joint owner 
						of the house in dispute.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
