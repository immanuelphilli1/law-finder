						<span style="font-family: Arial">GBADEGBE J.A. </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">read the following 
						judgment of the Court:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We have carefully 
						scrutinized the record of appeal in the matter herein 
						and have come to the view that the appeal succeeds for 
						the following reasons. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the first place, the 
						court is of the view that it was wrong for the learned 
						trial judge to have had the entire action determined by 
						resort to legal arguments. We are of the view that there 
						were several issues which arose on the pleadings as 
						indeed is borne out by the application for directions 
						filed on the 9th of May 1994. Most of the issues raised 
						in the view of the court were matters that required the 
						reception of evidence. In this regard we refer to issues 
						1, 2 and 3 as set out in the summons of directions by 
						way of example. Further to this, the court is of the 
						opinion that following the order made at the hearing of 
						the summons for directions on the 12th of May, 1994, if 
						there was any further matter or thing to be done in the 
						action by way of directions, then the correct procedure 
						was for the party who sought such an order to apply 
						under order 30 rule 5 of the rules of the trial court 
						for further directions.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We think that the 
						proceedings of that day which appear at page 18 of the 
						record of proceedings by which the learned trial judge 
						purported to adjourn the matter for further 
						consideration in the absence of anything in the record 
						to clearly indicate that any of the issues set out 
						before him required further directions was wrong. The 
						position, which we have taken, of the proceedings of 
						that day becomes clearer if the order as made by the 
						learned trial judge is reproduced.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;By Court: The issues 
						as filed by the plaintiffs are hereby set down for 
						trial. Case stands adjourned to 18/5/94 for further 
						consideration&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">If it may be asked who 
						raised any point or objection on the issues as filed 
						which required further consideration? We are unable to 
						accept the curse of conduct of the learned trial judge, 
						which appears not to be reflected by the proceedings on 
						which his subsequent order was based. In view of this we 
						think that the proceedings of the 18th of May at which 
						the direction regarding the taking of legal arguments 
						was made and immediately proceeded with by the reception 
						of arguments was wrong. Consequently, since the 
						proceedings based thereon were procured following a 
						non-compliance with the mandatory requirements of Order 
						30 Rule 5 of the Rules of the trial court they are 
						hereby set aside. Further, we are of the thinking that 
						the proceedings subsequent to the taking of the summons 
						of directions were improperly constituted with the 
						result that nothing of consequence at law can be derived 
						there from.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">But that is not all. We 
						also think that even if the proceedings of that day were 
						to be regular the record must clearly show on its face 
						that the learned trial judge indicated to the parties 
						that in his view the point in respect of which the 
						required legal arguments to be taken was likely to 
						substantially dispose of the action as required by order 
						25 of the rules of the trial court. The court also notes 
						that there was no indication by the parties acting by 
						their counsel that they had consented to the taking of 
						the preliminary legal arguments. In our view we think 
						that if anything the appellants whose pleadings had 
						raised most of the issues for trial bearing on facts 
						could not have given their consent to the procedure if 
						indeed their opinion was sought for it was quite 
						prejudicial to the entire case that they had set up by 
						way of defence to the action against them. It follows 
						that the learned trial judge exercised himself in a 
						manner not borne out by the settled practice of the 
						courts. Therefore on this ground also the proceedings 
						disclose a fundamental irregularity, which vitiates it. 
						Having held that the proceedings of the 18th of May are 
						fundamentally flawed, the court thinks that the 
						subsequent proceedings based thereon namely: The ruling 
						of the 18th of October, 1994 the subject matter of this 
						appeal is a nullity to which no attribute at law may be 
						attached. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Again, in our opinion 
						in the said ruling the learned trial judge made 
						reference to several matters of facts which were not in 
						evidence before him such as the letter terminating the 
						appointments of the respondents to this appeal and their 
						respective ages which he took into account in 
						determining their respective and entitlements to damages 
						for unlawful dismissal. The court notes the belated 
						attempt by the learned trial judge to give some 
						regularity to the damages that he was assessing by 
						purporting in the midst of the judgment to take evidence 
						from the respondents herein as to their respective ages. 
						We think that the conduct of the learned trial judge 
						reinforces our opinion that the assessment of damages 
						without legal evidence was wrong. Clearly in our view 
						the procedure, which he adopted, was not only wrong but 
						unauthorized.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We are of the view that 
						in the said circumstances the learned trial judge took 
						into accounts extraneous matters. Having thus taken 
						matters which were not lawfully admitted in evidence 
						into account in determining the action before him we 
						think that the judgment suffers from a defect which 
						renders it bad at law.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We must say that it was 
						for these reasons which are discernible from the record 
						of proceedings that in the exercise of the powers 
						conferred on us under rule 8(8) of C.I. 19 we called 
						upon learned counsel for the respondent on the last 
						adjournment had to satisfy us that the procedure adopted 
						by the learned trial judge was in accordance with the 
						settled practice and procedure of the court below. In 
						making that direction we were not unaware of the fact 
						that in his statement of case, learned counsel for the 
						appellant had raised those points in paragraph 2 and 3 
						thereof but did so having regarding to the fact that the 
						grounds of appeal as formulated in the notice of appeal 
						before us did not clearly bring out the points on which 
						our decision rest. Unfortunately, in response thereto, 
						learned counsel for the respondent did not answer the 
						point by way of reference to the record but by regard to 
						matters of speculation in a manner, which was not 
						satisfactory and did not persuade us that the course of 
						conduct adopted by the judge who presided over the trial 
						was regular.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Accordingly, we allow 
						the appeal herein and direct that the matter be 
						transmitted to the court below for a retrial to be 
						conducted according to law.</span></p>
