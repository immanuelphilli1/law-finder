						<span style="font-family: Arial">TWUMASI, J.A.:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is an appeal from 
						the judgment of an Accra High Court, dated 12th May 
						1999. For my convenience, I intend to retain the 
						positions of the parties as they stood at the trial 
						Court. As their names clearly suggest, the plaintiff and 
						the second defendant were Mr, and Mrs. Badu-Anum, 
						lawfully married. While the honeymoon lasted, the couple 
						naturally did all that one would expect from a couple in 
						those circumstances including, of course, the sharing in 
						each other&#8217;s sorrow and joy. During this period, the 
						plaintiff lost a relative and the second defendant had 
						to accompany her and other relations to the funeral. As 
						any responsible husband would do, the second defendant 
						provided as their means of transport to and from the 
						place&nbsp; of the funeral celebration, his Landrover Jeep 
						with registration No. ACR 6201. On their return from the 
						town Mankessim, where the funeral took place, an 
						accident occurred at Ekumfi Dunkwa between the Landrover 
						and an articulated truck with registration number WRA 
						3233 which was traveling from Accra, the opposite 
						direction.&nbsp; The result of the impact was so disastrous 
						that any ordinary person could not help but comment that 
						ill fate had cruelly inflicted upon the couple a 
						sequence of agony, because the plaintiff sustained 
						severe injuries while other passengers also had their 
						share of the injuries including one fatality. One of the 
						passengers by the name Ablor Adjei sustained serious 
						injuries as the others, but he was the only unfortunate 
						one who succumbed to the injuries at the Cape Coast 
						Central Hospital.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The police investigated 
						the accident and collected statements from some of the 
						plaintiff&#8217;s relations who survived the sad event and 
						also from the 2nd defendant. The plaintiff also made a 
						police statement. On completion of their investigations, 
						the police arraigned the 2nd defendant before the 
						District Court, Saltpond on one charge of careless 
						driving and six counts of negligently causing harm, but 
						he emerged victorious by his acquittal and discharge on 
						all the charges to each of which he pleaded Not Guilty. 
						The police report indicated that that was final, 
						implying that the articulated truck driver was never 
						charged and the police had no intention of ever doing 
						so. One curious thing about the case was that there was 
						no police sketch of the scene of the accident to 
						indicate such vital factors for determining fault as the 
						point of impact and other distances and resultant 
						positions of the two vehicles in the course of the 
						impact. The police, however, prepared their final 
						accident report, that stereotype document with which 
						insurance law practitioners are too familiar. As the 
						direct result of the accident, the plaintiff felt 
						entitled to institute legal proceedings for damages 
						against the person she perceived to be the tortfeasor 
						and the axe fell on the 2nd defendant, her husband who 
						was driving the Land rover at the material time of the 
						accident. By way of casual observation made without 
						prejudice, I should have thought that the better option 
						would have been an action against the two drivers and I 
						take cue and sustenance in my view from learned opinions 
						of eminent jurists both overseas and at our shores here 
						in Ghana including Lord Denning, Chief Justice Apaloo of 
						blessed memory, Chief justice Samuel Azu-Crabbe and 
						Justice Annan who happily are around with us.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Annan J (as he then 
						was) stated in Tishigu and Another v Abdulai Dagomba &amp; 
						Others, High Court, Kumasi reported in (1967) GLR 309 
						that proof or evidence of a collision per se on the 
						highway between two vehicles traveling in opposition 
						directions could not without more raise an inference or 
						presumption against either or both drivers. Lord Denning 
						of blessed memory stated in Baker v Market Harborough 
						Industrial Co-operation Society Ltd (1953) 1 WLR 1472 at 
						1476 thus:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Every day proof of the 
						collision is held to be sufficient to call on the two 
						defendants (drivers) for an answer. Never do they both 
						escape liability. One or other is held to blame and 
						sometimes both.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the celebrated local 
						case of Nyame v Tarzan Transport (1973) 1 GLR 8 C.A., 
						both Chief Justice Azu-Crabbe and Apaloo expressed 
						opinions in support of Lord Denning&#8217;s statement of the 
						law.&nbsp; That view was succinctly articulated by Azu-Crabbe 
						(JSC as he then was) with Lassey and Archer JJA (as they 
						then were) in the case of Mensah v Gonja CA No 69/71 
						dated 31st July 1972 unreported and I quote:&nbsp; </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Collision between two 
						vehicles on the highway raises an inference of 
						negligence against the drivers of vehicles involved in 
						the accident and the onus is then thrown on each driver 
						to exculpate himself. If evidence is led by the defence, 
						the trial judge must decide that the accident happened 
						in a particular way. This principle has recently been 
						considered by this court in Nyame v Tarzan Transport and 
						I adhere to everything I said in that case&#8221;. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my view the opinion 
						of Annan J (as he then was) in Tishigu v Dagomba (supra) 
						is not inconsistent with the opinion of their Lordships 
						as expressed in Nyame v Tarzan Transport (supra) and 
						that of Lord Denning in Baker&#8217;s case (supra). A useful 
						lesson for practitioners is that there can be no hard 
						and fast principle or practice directive that where 
						there is a collision between two vehicles the injured 
						person must as of necessity sue the drivers of the 
						vehicles. Where the injured person is unsure of the 
						guilty driver because he does not possess either 
						watertight evidence or otherwise, it would be counsel of 
						prudence to sue the two drivers. It follows that he 
						should not hesitate to sue one of the drivers against 
						whom there is overwhelming evidence of negligence 
						resulting in the collision. But having said this, the 
						advantages of suing both drivers must be obvious to 
						practitioners. I now proceed to look very closely at the 
						strength of the case made by the plaintiff against the 
						defendants. The plaintiff in paragraph (1) of her 
						statement of claim accused the second defendant of 
						driving at top speed and thereby causing the accident 
						while he was overtaking a leading taxi cab. If this was 
						true, then the second defendant would be adjudged guilty 
						because the rules in our Highway Code 1973 provide in 
						regulation 72 thereof that: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;72 Do not overtake:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">- When to do so Would 
						force another</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Vehicle to swerve or 
						slow down&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This rule has been 
						judicially considered in many cases including Saunders v 
						Awudu (1962) 1 GLR 472. As I stated in my book &#8220;Criminal 
						Law In Ghana&#8221; page 599:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;It is highly essential 
						and imperative that a driver of a motor vehicle observe 
						and comply with the regulations which govern driving of 
						a motor vehicle on a road. Any breach of these 
						regulations may constitute a prima facie evidence of 
						careless and negligent driving:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">See Dagomba v Dagomba 
						1969 CC48&#8221;.&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Other cases of recent 
						publication which have supported my view include Yakubu 
						v Dove (1977) 1 GLR 281 CA;&nbsp; Aboagye v Engman (1989-90)&nbsp; 
						1 GLR 416 and Norgbey v Asante (1992) 1 GLR 506.&nbsp; In all 
						these cases the guilty drivers were found to have 
						breached a regulation of the Ghana Highway Code, 1973. 
						This is well and good but the 2nd defendant denied this 
						averment of the plaintiff: see paragraph 2 of the 
						Statement of Defence and Counterclaim filed on 15th 
						march 1996. The second defendant&#8217;s version is contained 
						in paragraphs 4 to 7 and I reproduce them hereunder:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;4. The said accident 
						occurred because the on-coming vehicle an articulator 
						registered as WRA 3233 had strayed over from its own 
						lane into the lane that should have been occupied by the 
						2nd defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">5. 2nd defendant was 
						not aware of this state of affairs until he reached to 
						top of a hill or rise, when the articulator came into 
						sight driving straight toward 2nd defendant&#8217;s vehicle in 
						the 2nd defendant&#8217;s lane.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">6. 2nd defendant tried 
						to avoid a head-on collision by swerving to his left 
						into the lane that should have been occupied by the 
						articulator. This maneuver was not entirely successful 
						and there was a grazing or brushing collision between 
						the right side of ACR 6201 and the right side of the 
						articulator WRA 3233. Both vehicles capsized.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">7. The plaintiff made a 
						statement to the police soon after the said accident in 
						which she did not make any of the allegations of 
						negligence on 2nd defendant&#8217;s part, including the 
						particulars thereof, now made by her in this suit.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is interesting to 
						observe that in the particulars of negligence alleged 
						against the 2nd defendant the plaintiff stated as 
						follows: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;© overtaking or 
						attempting to overtake the said unidentified vehicle in 
						the said area that ended in the lane of the on-coming 
						vehicle No. WRA 3233&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Earlier in paragraph 
						(1) of her Statement of Claim the plaintiff had pleaded 
						as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;and whilst overtaking 
						an unidentified vehicle so negligently drove, managed 
						and controlled his said Land Rover along that road into 
						the lane of an on-coming vehicle No. WRA 3233&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;.
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In her evidence in 
						court, however, the plaintiff was emphatic that the 2nd 
						defendant was overtaking a taxi cab. This raises a 
						crucial question mark for comment at the appropriate 
						time. On the other side of the spectrum, the 2nd 
						defendant stated in his evidence before the court that 
						before he reached the top of the hill from where he 
						sighted the articulator he had overtaken a mini bus: He 
						testified as follows at page 45 of the record of 
						appeal:- </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;About 15 miles from 
						Mankessim I overtook a mini bus and soon after I climbed 
						a small hill. Then after the hill there was an 
						articulator vehicle. I observed that it was traveling in 
						my lane directly infront of me I therefore swerved into 
						the empty lane to avoid a head-on collision. I swerved 
						to the lane of the articulator which was empty. I 
						avoided the articulator but it hit the right side of my 
						door. I did not notice any damage to the articulator. I 
						was injured. I had head injury, leg injury, my right 
						hand was injured. All the passengers sustained injuries 
						and my nephew later died.&#8221;</span></p>

						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the same vein, this 
						testimony will be scrutinized at the due time in the 
						cause of this appeal. The third and, perhaps, the 
						trickiest forensic observatory in this case is the 
						police accident report, Exhibit B. The report is 
						remarkable for its brevity and cutting edge and for my 
						purposes and in the interest of fairplay I feel 
						constrained to reproduce it, if for no other reason than 
						that it throws a crystal&nbsp; clear sunray on its probative 
						value and significance. It goes like this:-&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Brief facts. One 
						20/2/94 at about 4.30pm suspect driver Geofrey Badu-Anum 
						was driving Landrover Jeep No. ACR 6201 along the 
						Accra-Mankessim road from the direction of Mankessim 
						towards Accra with six persons on board at top speed. On 
						reaching a section of the road after Ekumfi Dunkwa, and 
						whilst overtaking an unidentified vehicle lost control 
						and drove into the lane of on-coming vehicle No. WRA 
						3233 and collided head-on. Both vehicles were damaged 
						and all the occupants on vehicle No. ACR 6201 sustained 
						serious injuries and were rushed to the Cape Coast 
						Central Hospital for treatment where victim Ablor Adjei 
						died on arrival.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This police report, 
						Exhibit B, was tendered by one Daniel Arthur who claimed 
						to be a policeman attached to the Esakyiri Police 
						Station. He testified as DW1 after the plaintiff had 
						closed her case, so he was apparently called by the 2nd 
						defendant for the purpose of tendering Exhibit B. In his 
						testimony which was not subjected to any 
						cross-examination by counsel for the plaintiff, DW1 
						stated that all the five passengers made statements to 
						the police and the originals were in fact tendered. In 
						actual fact, what I have on the record of appeal are 
						statements made by the plaintiff, the 2nd defendant and 
						four others who claimed to have been passengers on the 
						Landrover. The 2nd defendant testified that all the 
						passengers were relatives of the plaintiff. This was not 
						challenged in cross-examination. None of them was called 
						to testify in court. DW1 testified that he referred the 
						case to a Sergeant Manu, but no account is made about 
						what he did about the case by way of investigation. The 
						extent to which these police statements impacted on the 
						resolution of the questions of fact posed thereby in 
						terms of their probative value or otherwise will be duly 
						and, hopefully, satisfactorily considered at the pivotal 
						stage in this appeal. Suffice it to say at this 
						juncture, that in none of the police statements 
						including that of the plaintiff, was any mention made of 
						the Landrover overtaking any vehicle immediately before 
						or simultaneously with the collision of the two 
						vehicles. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The second phase of the 
						appeal concerns the claim against the 1st defendant for 
						damages for vicarious liability on the ground alleged by 
						th.e plaintiff that the 1st defendant, a limited 
						liability company, was at all times material to this 
						case, the owner of the Landrover. Paragraph 1 of the 
						Statement of Claim provides the detail of the claim as 
						follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;(1) On about the 20th 
						day of February 1994 at about 1.30pm&nbsp; the plaintiff was 
						a passenger in Landrover Jeep registration number ACR&nbsp; 
						6201 owned by the 1st defendant, formerly known as Cluff 
						Taywood Mining Ltd., a company registered to do business 
						in Ghana and driven by the 2nd defendant as its servant 
						or agent along the Accra-Mankessim motor road&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In response to this 
						averment the 1st defendant filed a statement of defence 
						on the 22nd March 1996 (See pages 11 to 12 of the record 
						of appeal). The gist of paragraph 2 of the defence is 
						that under an agreement between the 1st defendant and 
						the 2nd defendant&#8217;s company known by the name Canom 
						Farms and Mining Industry Limited, the 1st defendant, 
						for valuable consideration, gave to the 2nd defendant&#8217;s 
						company cash the sum of US $7,500.00 together with the 
						reconditioned Land rover with registration number ACR 
						6201 in or about October 1991. Subparagraphs (v), (vi) 
						and (vii) of the said paragraph 2 read as follows:-</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;(V) the 1st defendant 
						gave to the 2nd defendant all the appropriate papers on 
						the vehicle to make it possible for 2nd defendant to 
						effect a transfer of the vehicle into his company&#8217;s 
						name. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(vi) The 1st defendant 
						was not aware that the vehicle was still in its name.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(vii) The 1st defendant 
						says that for all practical purposes it had transferred 
						Land rover No. ACR 6201 to the 2nd defendant&#8217;s company 
						by November 1991 and has since then, had no right, title 
						or control over the said vehicle, its movements or 
						owner&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The curious thing in 
						the pleadings is that a reply was filed on behalf of the 
						plaintiff to the Statement of Defence and counterclaim 
						filed by the 2nd defendant, but there was none filed in 
						respect of the statement of defence filed on behalf of 
						the 1st defendant. I did not see any appearing in the 
						index to the record of appeal. I combed the full record 
						from page 1 to 111 including the list of exhibits but to 
						no avail. In my view, the failure by the plaintiff to 
						file a reply either to deny or admit any of the 
						averments made by the 1st defendant in the statement of 
						defence amounted to admission of the said averments and 
						there was no need for the 1st defendant to produce 
						evidence in their proof:&nbsp; see Court of Appeal decision 
						in Armah v Addoquaye (1972) 1 GLR 109. As a factor in 
						the determination of this appeal, the material facts 
						alleged by the 1st defendant which I have quoted in 
						extenso above shall be treated as proven facts and may 
						form the basis of any conclusions of law as the court 
						may deem fit. Even looking at the evidence, there is 
						sufficient justification to support this finding that 
						the 2nd defendant was the owner of the Landrover Jeep. 
						In his evidence in chief the 2nd defendant stated at 
						page 45 of the record of appeal thus:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;I acquire the vehicle 
						from the 1st defendants around 1993-94.&nbsp; It was a 
						compensation from the 1st defendants when the 1st 
						defendants were leaving Ghana&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There was an obvious 
						conflict in the testimony as to the date the 2nd 
						defendant acquired the vehicle as per the statement of 
						the 1st defendant I have quoted above and his evidence 
						in court. In the former the date is in or about 1991, in 
						the latter about 1993-94. The law as I understand it is 
						that where there is a conflict in the testimony of one 
						witness or between the testimonies of two witnesses on 
						an issue, the court must declare the conflict immaterial 
						if on the evidence as a whole there is material 
						corroboration from the opposing party:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">See Obeng v The 
						Republic (1971) 2 GLR 107 CA.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">During 
						cross-examination of the plaintiff the following 
						questions and answers appeared at pages 24-25</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Question: Divorce

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Question:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you 
						stand as at now you stand by the averments in Exhibit&nbsp; 1 
						&amp; 2</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Answer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, but 
						the insurance is in the name of the 1st defendant.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">From the foregoing 
						analysis of the pleadings and the evidence adduced 
						before the trial court, two facts are incontrovertible 
						and they are (1) That the Landrover was the property of 
						the 2nd defendant at the time of the accident (2) That 
						the insurance covering it was in the name of the 1st 
						defendant. The 2nd defendant in his evidence in 
						cross-examination admitted that the insurance was in the 
						name of the 1st defendant. He claimed that he changed 
						the name and replaced his, but he was not sure whether 
						it was before or after the accident and in any event he 
						could or did not produce his own insurance at the trial. 
						In due course the legal effect of these established 
						facts will be articulated. The learned trial judge made 
						the following findings and conclusions of law by way of 
						summary:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1) That the 1st 
						defendant was vicariously liable for the consequences of 
						the 2nd defendant&#8217;s driving of the Land rover Jeep 
						because :</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) The vehicle had 
						been registered in the 1st defendant&#8217;s name at the time 
						of the event.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) the insurance 
						policy was still in the name of the 1st defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) the foregoing 
						circumstances made the 1st defendant still owner of the 
						vehicle.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d) an owner may be 
						held liable for vicarious liability even though the 
						driver may not be his servant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Then on the question of 
						negligent driving the learned trial Judge made the 
						following positive findings:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2)&nbsp; That the 2nd 
						defendant was guilty of negligent driving and was liable 
						in an action for damages for that tort because:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; the plaintiff&#8217;s 
						testimony was amply corroborated by the police report 
						Ex. B </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b)&nbsp; the 2nd defendant 
						was negligent because he overtook a leading vehicle when 
						it was not safe to do so.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the basis of these 
						findings, the leaned trial judge entered judgment 
						against the two defendants jointly and severally and 
						awarded the plaintiff twenty million cedis (¢20M) 
						damages and two million cedis (¢2M) costs. The 
						defendants appealed against the judgment on a number of 
						grounds on both the facts and law. I intend to 
						capitulate the points germane to the appeal with a view 
						to narrowing the issues of fact and law involved. On 
						behalf of the 1st defendant, Counsel submitted that on 
						the facts before the trial court, the leaned trial judge 
						erred in holding that the 1st appellant was vicariously 
						liable. Then on the question of negligence both Counsel 
						for the defendants univocally criticised and faulted the 
						learned judge&#8217;s findings for a number of reasons. In 
						particular, as against the finding that the plaintiff&#8217;s 
						evidence was corroborated both counsel for the 
						appellants submitted that (1) there was a material 
						inconsistency between the plaintiff&#8217;s evidence in court 
						and her police statement in the sense that whereas in 
						the police statement which she made when the facts were 
						fresh in her mind, she never made no mention of the 2nd 
						defendant overtaking another vehicle, in her evidence in 
						court she introduced these facts. Perhaps, what counsel 
						were saying in essence was that the evidence in court 
						must have been concocted after the police statement had 
						been made and consequently was an afterthought.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">To counsel for the 2nd 
						defendant, the police report which tallied with the 
						plaintiff&#8217;s testimony in court on the issue of 
						overtaking since it was itself an afterthought could not 
						afford corroboration and in any event in law a witness 
						cannot corroborate himself. In his view the police 
						report had no probative value so as to support or 
						corroborate any evidence of the plaintiff. Counsel for 
						the 1st defendant basing himself on the case of Fynn v 
						Badu (1971) 1 GLR 80, submitted that on the facts, the 
						2nd defendant owned the land rover in his own right and 
						the 1st defendant could not be held vicariously liable 
						for the acts of the 2nd defendant. Counsel for the 
						plaintiff, for his part, strongly supported the findings 
						of the learned trial judge based on the facts that the 
						insurance policy was in the name of the 1st defendant 
						who he contended had an insurable interest. On the 
						question of negligence he attached considerable weight 
						to the police report and extolled its probative value 
						even to the status of prima facie case. Counsel for the 
						2nd defendant appealed and made submission against the 
						quantum of damages and costs that they were in each case 
						excessive. The nature of the injuries suffered by the 
						plaintiff did not feature prominently in the appeal. Now 
						is the proper stage for me to express my views on the 
						wrongness or correctness of the judgment appealed. I 
						would like to start with the 1st appellant&#8217;s position as 
						to vicarious liability.&nbsp; In this regard, I deem it 
						essential to be clear about our terminology. My 
						understanding of this term is simple. Vicarious 
						liability in the legal conceptual sense is transferred 
						liability. As a basic legal norm, liability for the 
						consequences of a tortious act is invariably attached 
						primarily to the tortfeasor, but under the rule which I 
						term transferred liability, the law extends the 
						liability to another person who then becomes jointly and 
						severally liable with the tortfeasor for the act done or 
						committed at his instance and upon his direction or 
						authorisation or in his interest or for his purposes.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Relationships under 
						which such authorisation or direction or interest are 
						often presumed in law include; principal and his agent, 
						a master and his servant, an employer and his employee 
						or such blood or social relationships as exist between a 
						parent and his child, a person and his friend and so on, 
						as the category of such relationship is never closed, 
						the test always being whether there is proof of 
						authorisation or direction or interest as stated above: 
						See Honeywill v Larkin (1934) 1 KB 191; Mersey v Coggins 
						(1947) A.C. 1; Larren v Henlys (1948) 2 All ER 935; 
						Omrod v Crosville (1953) 2 All ER 753 and our local case 
						Republic v National Investment Bank, Ex Parte Cantil 
						(1984-86) 1 GLR 237. In the instant case, there was 
						nowhere in the evidence which I have endeavored to 
						outline where any of the essential elements of vicarious 
						liability as explained by me is disclosed. The learned 
						trial judge sought to justify his finding on the dictum 
						of Lord Denning in the case of Omrod v Crosville 
						(supra). At page 81 of the record of appeal he cited 
						this case and quoted Lord Denning as saying:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;An owner may be liable 
						although the driver is not his servant&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned trial judge 
						in my view misapplied the facts in Omrod&#8217;s case to those 
						in the instant case. In Omrod&#8217;s case, the owner of a 
						Healey car was held liable for the negligence of a 
						friend who was driving it from Birkenhead to Monte 
						Carlo, for it was proposed that on arrival they should 
						use it for a joint holiday. In that case, the owner of 
						the car authorised the use of it for his interest and 
						purposes. This English case is therefore distinguishable 
						from the instant case, because the 1st defendant had 
						divested himself of his ownership of the Landrover and 
						had not authorised its use for the funeral in which he 
						had no interest. The Omrod&#8217;s case is further to be 
						distinguished on the ground that in the instant case, 
						ownership of the Landrover was no longer vested in the 
						1st defendant as it was in Omrod&#8217;s case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned trial 
						judge, however, found that ownership of the Landrover 
						still remained in the 1st defendant because of the fact 
						that the insurance policy on the vehicle as well as the 
						registration of the vehicle were in its name. In 
						resolving this issue, I feel inclined to quote verbatim 
						paragraph 2/3 of the statement of case filed by counsel 
						for the 1st defendant:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Finally on this point 
						the 1st appellants contend that the learned trial judge 
						erred in disregarding relevant decisions brought to his 
						attention.&nbsp; For example, Fynn v Badu (1971) 1 GLR 80 the 
						head note states:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;There is not sound 
						policy peculiar to Ghana for imposing vicarious 
						liability upon a person who either sells on credit or 
						hires his vehicle to a third person to whom he 
						relinquishes possession and control simply because he 
						retains in himself the bare legal title and is 
						interested only in the balance of the purchase price or 
						the hire purchase rentals. If strong reasons of public 
						policy require that vicarious liability should be 
						imposed on an owner of a vehicle in such a case, it 
						should be done by enacted, not judicial legislation.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">That case was a hire 
						purchase agreement and the Court of Appeal declined to 
						impose upon the owner vicarious liability for the 
						tortious act of the hire-purchaser. In the other cases 
						cited by Counsel for the 1st defendant, namely, Sharani 
						v Badu 23 February 1970 CA unreported where the owner 
						had sold his vehicle to another who in turn engaged the 
						tortfeasor to drive it and the other case Amegbor v 
						Chahal (1967) GLR 341 (Annan J as he then was) the court 
						held that vicarious liability could not be imposed on 
						the owners of such vehicles. Counsel for the plaintiff 
						reacted adversely to the submissions of his learned 
						friends and I wish to quote the relevant passage of his 
						statement of case at page 3 thereof:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;(ii) The trial court 
						was right in holding that since the 1st defendant was 
						not able to convince the court and give evidence to 
						rebut the presumption of law that policyholder is deemed 
						to be owner of the vehicle we submit that the dictum of 
						Lord Denning in Omrod v Crosville Motor Services Ltd. 
						(1953) 2 All ER 753 applies to this instant case. The 
						facts which were the subject matter of the decision in 
						Fynn v Badu (1971) 1 GLR 80, a hire-purchase case based 
						on joint possession are different&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">My view of the law on 
						this subject under consideration is that where a person 
						owing property, sells it to another either on outright 
						payment or on credit, property in the subject is deemed 
						to have been transferred from the owner to the purchaser 
						upon delivery of the property to the buyer unless a 
						contrary intention is proved and intention in this 
						regard may be inferred from the conduct of the parties 
						before, at or subsequent to the transaction including 
						also all the surrounding circumstance of the case: see 
						Donkor v Alhassan (1987-88) 2 GLR 253 CA holding 4 which 
						states the law clearly as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Since there had been 
						full payment for an identifiable house and all that was 
						left was the execution of an instrument of transfer to 
						the respondent (buyer), provided there had been no 
						fraud, duress or unconscionability the court could 
						enforce the contract&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This decision of the 
						Court of Appeal is in conformity with section 26 (2) of 
						the Sale of Goods Act 1962 (act 137) See Yirenkyi v 
						Termekpey (1987-88) 1 GLR 533 CA.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instant case, 
						there is no evidence of any intention on the part of the 
						1st and 2nd defendants from which it could be inferred 
						that the delivery of the Landrover was not the 
						conclusion of the transaction. The question of the 
						insurance policy being used as a basis for imposition of 
						vicarious liability is in my view totally untenable. I 
						concede the presumption that a person holding a policy 
						owns the vehicle so insured but this presumption is 
						rebuttable and sight must not be lost of the legal and 
						equitable principle that a purchaser of a property like 
						a motor vehicle acquires not only the vehicle but also 
						all relevant documents which by law must cover the 
						ownership of the vehicle. The reason underlying this 
						rule is that the purchaser becomes entitled to 
						everything about the vehicle including the certificate 
						of insurance if it is not expired. The policy becomes of 
						no use or benefit to the seller any longer. Where the 
						terms of the policy do not make it possible for the 
						purchaser to use it e.g. if it contains a named driver&#8217;s 
						clause, the purchaser would have to obtain his own 
						policy because the law imposes a sanction if he does not 
						do so and also he cannot be indemnified by the insurance 
						company in the event of an accident involving the 
						vehicle. In the instant case, as soon as the 1st 
						defendant surrendered to the 2nd defendant the vehicle 
						and its documents including the insurance policy, 
						everything became a fait accompli. The 1st defendant 
						literally in law washed his hands completely off the 
						vehicle. The legal position was that from the time the 
						vehicle was delivered to the 2nd defendant he became the 
						owner. For section 1 of the Road Traffic ordinance No. 
						52 of 1952 provides as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Owner means the person 
						by whom the vehicle is kept and used and, in relation to 
						a vehicle which is subject to hiring agreement, or hire 
						purchase agreement, means the person keeping and using 
						the vehicle under that agreement and the expression 
						ownership shall be construed accordingly&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I must say that so far 
						my research into the case law on road traffic 
						legislation throughout our law reports did not reveal to 
						me a case in which section 1 of the Road Traffic 
						Ordinance has been judicially considered. Now that it 
						has come to my notice, I wish to state the legal 
						position as best I can. Under and by virtue of section 
						(1) of the Road Traffic Ordinance (No. 52 of 1952) the 
						status of any person who keeps and uses any vehicle 
						under any agreement, whether of sale upon outright 
						payment or on credit or under a hire-purchase agreement 
						and, if I may add, even under what is commonly known as 
						work and pay, is that he is the owner of the vehicle for 
						all practical purposes. It follows in my judgment, that 
						it would be totally wrong to hold that the 1st 
						defendant, is the owner of the vehicle because the 
						insurance policy on the vehicle or its registration is 
						in its name. Therefore when the question of negligence 
						arises in the use of the vehicle any person who suffers 
						any damage shall have no cause of action against the 
						original owner. The person who keeps and uses the 
						vehicle is the person to deal with in all claims of this 
						nature. There is therefore in my view no need for any 
						further legislation on the subject as it was advocated 
						by their lordships in the case of Fynn v Badu (supra). 
						The legislature has done its duty already and it is up 
						to the courts to enforce the law. Perhaps, it may be 
						necessary to say something about insurance policy. In 
						his book &#8220;Slater&#8217;s Mercantile Law&#8221; 5th Edition page 301 
						the learned author defines insurance as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Insurance is the 
						purchase of security.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The assured, anxious to 
						protect himself against a risk purchases from the 
						insurer the right to be indemnified if the risk should 
						materialize. The purchase price which the assured pays 
						the insurer is known as the premium, often an annual 
						payment and the insurer&#8217;s promise to pay if the event 
						insured against occurs is embodied in what is called a 
						policy&#8221;.&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">And section 59 of our 
						Insurance Act 1965 (act 288) defines a policy as:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Policy includes every 
						writing whereby any contract of insurance is made or 
						agreed to be made.&#8221;</span></p>

						<span style="font-family: Arial">The argument by learned 
						Counsel for the plaintiff relying on the English case of 
						Sefton v Tophms Ltd &amp; Anor (1965) 3 WLR 525 CA that the 
						1st defendant still retained an insurable interest in 
						the vehicle at the time of the accident does not find 
						favour with local decisions on the subject. In that case 
						the plaintiff who had insurable interest in a property 
						claimed for an injunction to restrain the defendant from 
						breaking a covenant affecting the property. Clearly the 
						facts are inapplicable to the instant case. The 
						essential characteristic of an insurance is that it is a 
						contract between the assured and the insurer. 
						Quintessentially, it is operated within the rubric of 
						the law of contract as distinguished from vicarious 
						liability which is an element of the law of torts. If an 
						insurance company is called upon to satisfy a liability 
						arising from a road traffic accident whether due to 
						negligence or not, the liability is imposed upon him by 
						the terms of the policy of insurance he has contracted, 
						not in any way based upon the liability which a master 
						may owe to his servant or an employer may owe to his 
						employee by the law of vicarious liability. The learned 
						trial, therefore, fell into serious error because of his 
						failure to appreciate the essential characteristics of 
						ownership under the common law, ownership under our road 
						traffic laws and, more importantly, the relationship 
						between ownership of a motor vehicle and policy of 
						insurance covering it vis- a-vis negligence and 
						vicarious liability in the law of torts. For the 
						foregoing reasons the ground of appeal on vicarious 
						liability succeeds. The next phase of the case is the 
						issue of whether the 2nd defendant was negligent. Right 
						from the onset, the mere occurrence of a collision 
						between two vehicles operates as a prima facie case or 
						presumptive evidence in favour of the plaintiff against 
						the two drivers each of whom has the burden of rebutting 
						the presumption. The 2nd defendant had the burden of 
						producing evidence which on the balance of the 
						probabilities should exonerate him from blame. On the 
						degree of proof by preponderance of probabilities see 
						the recent Supreme Court decision in Adwubeng v Domfeh 
						(1996-97) SCGLR 660 at 662 (holding 4 on the 
						interpretation of section 11 (4) &amp; (12) of the Evidence 
						Degree 1975 (NRCD 323). Justice S. A. Brobbey put the 
						principle in its full perspective at page 322 of his 
						book. &#8220;Practice And Procedure In The Courts&#8221; 1st edition 
						as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The onus of proof on a 
						party in a civil case is however less than that on the 
						prosecution in a criminal case, it being on a balance of 
						probabilities only: see Serwah v Kesse (1960) GLR 277 at 
						228, S.C. NRCD 323 provides further that the burden of 
						persuasion requires proof by &#8220;preponderance of 
						probabilities&#8221; which is defined in section 12(2) to mean 
						&#8220;that degree of certainty of belief in the mind of the 
						tribunal of fact or the court by which it is convinced 
						that the existence of a fact is more probable than its 
						non-existence&#8221;. The burden of proof may shift from the 
						plaintiff to the defendant or vice versa and this is 
						clearly covered by NRCD 323, S14&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In order to determine 
						whether the 2nd defendant has discharged the burden of 
						persuasion, the trial court was under a duty to apply 
						the judicial process which requires him to evaluate the 
						totality of the evidence adduced by or behalf of the 
						rival parties. First the police report. Did the trial 
						judge apply the judicial approach to evaluate it and to 
						assess its probative value?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I am afraid he failed 
						totally in his appraisal of the said report. His 
						greatest fault was that he was unable to detect that the 
						policeman who prepared it was biased in favour of the 
						plaintiff to the prejudice of the 2nd defendant. In 
						preparing the facts of an accident the police must 
						incorporate in a nutshell the issues raised by the 
						police statements made by all persons who in law are 
						potential witnesses at the trial. In his report, the 
						police officer completely suppressed the substance of 
						the statements made by four persons who were on the 2nd 
						defendant&#8217;s vehicle, all of whom stated that they saw an 
						articulator in the lane of the 2nd defendant and never 
						made mention of overtaking of any vehicle leading the 
						2nd defendant. Even the plaintiff never said so in her 
						statement to the police, but the police officer 
						introduced his own facts into the report that the 2nd 
						defendant was overtaking an unidentified vehicle and in 
						the process collided with the on-coming articulator 
						truck. Either by coincidence or design, the plaintiff 
						introduced that fact about overtaking in her evidence in 
						court.&nbsp; The rule of evidence is that where the evidence 
						of a witness in court conflicts with an earlier 
						extra-judicial statement, a court ought not treat such 
						witness as credible see Adwubeng v Donfeh (1996-97) 
						SCGLR 660. In support of Adwubeng v Donfeh there is the 
						oft-quoted dictum of Osei-Hwere J (as he then was) in 
						Yaro v The Republic (1979) GLR 10 at 17 where he said:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;A previous statement 
						made by a witness to the police which was in distinct 
						conflict with his evidence on oath was always admissible 
						to discredit or contradict him see Poku v The State 
						(1966) GLR 262 SC. Where, therefore a witness has made a 
						prior statement, either orally or in writing, which is 
						inconsistent with his evidence on oath then it will be 
						presumed against him that his evidence on oath is false, 
						unless he gives satisfactory explanation of the prior 
						inconsistent statement&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At page 92 of the 
						&#8220;Commentary On The Evidence Decree, 1975 (NRCD 323) the 
						learned commentator states that &#8220;if the evidence of the 
						prior statement indicates special circumstances which 
						support its trustworthiness, then the trier of fact 
						should be able to consider the original statement as 
						evidence of the truth of the matter.&#8221; As Counsel for the 
						2nd defendant rightly pointed out, the learned trial 
						judge should have preferred the prior statement of the 
						plaintiff because she made that statement when the facts 
						were fresh in her mind. Therefore since in the earlier 
						statement the plaintiff made no mention of the 2nd 
						defendant overtaking a taxi the learned judge erred in 
						not so holding.&nbsp; The learned trial judge therefore ought 
						to have rejected the evidence given by the plaintiff in 
						court that the 2nd defendant&#8217;s vehicle was overtaking a 
						leading taxi when it collided with the articulator. In 
						this regard, I would embellish the submissions of 
						Counsel for the 2nd defendant where he said the 
						plaintiff could not corroborate herself by saying that 
						the plaintiff&#8217;s evidence was a fabrication made by 
						herself and it could not be corroborated by a police 
						report which was also fabricated. Counsel for the 1st 
						defendant submitted that the statement made by the four 
						relatives of the plaintiff were admissible under section 
						5 (2) (b) of the Evidence Decree 1975 (NRCD 323) because 
						they were admitted without objection. This submission is 
						right and that is the reason why I criticised the trial 
						judge for his failure to consider them. If he had 
						examined those statements, it would have dawned upon him 
						at all costs that the police report on the facts of the 
						accident was most unreliable. The probative value of any 
						evidence, oral or documentary, or real, including a 
						police report, depends on the weight which a court or 
						trier of fact would attach to it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A police report is 
						essentially a conglomeration of information from various 
						sources as well as things seen by the reporter himself. 
						Facts contained in the report which are undisputed may 
						be accepted as admissions and accordingly as exceptions 
						to the hearsay rule. Others in controversy such as 
						conflicting stories of how an accident occurred must be 
						resolved by the court through the judicial process i.e. 
						by calling witnesses to testify in the witness stand and 
						subjecting them to cross-examination. Just as a police 
						officer fails in his duty if he presents as his report 
						one rival version to the exclusion the other, so does a 
						trial judge err if he accepts such one-sided report as 
						the whole truth? Counsel for the plaintiff submitted 
						that a police report is prepared after the police have 
						visited the scene of the accident and gathered facts 
						including a police sketch of distances and points.&nbsp; With 
						the greatest respect, there is no such evidence in the 
						instant case. There was no police sketch of the scene of 
						accident and so the court was left with only the oral 
						testimonies and the statements of the plaintiff&#8217;s 
						relatives. Having analysed all the evidence, I am 
						satisfied that the 2nd defendant&#8217;s story was more 
						probable than not and that he succeeded in discharging 
						the burden of persuasion. By way of emphasis, it must be 
						stated that in determining whether a party on whom the 
						burden of persuasion lies has discharged the duty cast 
						on him, his version or evidence must be considered on 
						the totality of the evidence adduced at the trial 
						whether from the evidence of his witnesses or of his 
						adversary. It is at this crucial stage of the judgment 
						that I feel called upon by the dictates of fair play and 
						justice to reassess the evidence of the plaintiff as 
						against that of the 2nd defendant and to evaluate their 
						relative strengths on the balancing scale. Earlier on I 
						stated by citing case law that a witness who creates a 
						conflict between his prior statement to the police and 
						his testimony in court was not to be treated as credible 
						and I demonstrated the areas where the plaintiff failed 
						this acid test. The 2nd defendant stood unscathed on 
						this score as there was no such conflict in his 
						evidence. Now, taking the most charitable view of the 
						situation, I resorted to the case of Obeng v. The 
						Republic (1972) 2 GLR CA where the court held that where 
						there is a conflict in the evidence of a witness but the 
						material part in issue is corroborated by other 
						independent parts of the evidence as a whole, a court 
						ought not reject the evidence of the witness and treat 
						him as an untruthful witness. Unfortunately for the 
						plaintiff in the instant case, no such corroborative 
						evidence was available, such corroborative evidence as 
						there was, namely the statements of the other passengers 
						on the vehicle favoured the 2nd defendant. In the light 
						of this I find that upon the proven facts, the 2nd 
						defendant&#8217;s version of the accident was more probable 
						than not and consequently there would be a finding that 
						he was not negligent. The simple reason is that the 
						articulator driver created a dangerous situation on the 
						road which made the 2nd defendant unable to avoid the 
						collision. There is a defence of inevitable accident but 
						the court would prefer to say that there was no case of 
						negligence. As it is stated at page 28 of the famous 
						book &#8220;Salmond On Torts&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">12th edition:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The plea of inevitable 
						accident is that the consequences complained of as a 
						wrong were not intended by the defendant and could not 
						have been forseen and avoided by the exercise of 
						reasonable care and skill.&#8221;</span></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">To my mind, looking at

						extraordinary courage in swerving the Landrover into the 
						space left by the articulator to avoid head-on 
						collision. But for this hilarious feat by the 2nd 
						defendant, the fatality toll of the accident might well 
						have risen above only one. In the result the appeals 
						filed the 1st defendant is allowed and so is that of the 
						2nd defendant. The judgment of the court below is hereby 
						set aside. In lieu thereof there shall be a judgment
