						<span style="font-family: Arial">MRS. WOOD, J.A.:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Following the 
						restructuring of the defendant appellant Company in 
						1994, the plaintiff respondents were declared redundant 
						and paid severance benefits in accordance with the 
						prevailing collective agreement. Each respondent 
						therefore became entitled to &#8220;Two months consolidated 
						basic pay for each year of service, effective 1st 
						January, 1961 to the date of redundancy&#8221;, However, 
						contending that the awards were void, unlawful and of no 
						legal effect, in that they violated the clear, mandatory 
						provisions of the Labour (Amendment) Decree, 1969 
						NLCD.342, the respondents, severance compensation with 
						effect from the date each plaintiff commenced work with 
						the defendant company as employed up to 31st December, 
						1990.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2. Interest at 
						prevailing bank rate from 1st February, 1994 to date of 
						payment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3. An order directing 
						defendants to immediately negotiate the severance 
						compensation with the plaintiffs for the period of 
						service of each plaintiff before 1st January, 1991, 
						failing which the Honourable Court could itself 
						determine a fair and just compensation for the period 
						concerned.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellants raised 
						two matters in defence to the substantive claim. These 
						are contained in their original and unamended statement 
						of defence. Firstly, that the quantum of severance award 
						is not fixed by statute, but was a matter of 
						negotiation. And consequently, as the respondent were 
						all duly paid in accordance with the negotiated 
						provisions of the existing, valid, collective agreement, 
						they are estopped from any further claims.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Secondly, that the 
						claim was statute barred. The learned trial judge 
						however found the claims proved and entered judgment in 
						favour of all the respondents on all the claims sought, 
						together with costs of ¢10 million. In this appeal, as 
						many as ten grounds were urged upon six of which 
						original grounds A, B and C and additional grounds (1), 
						(2) and (3) were argued together. My own view is that 
						the latter, i.e. the additional grounds are a 
						duplication of the original grounds of appeal. 
						Therefore, rather than reproduce all six grounds of 
						appeal, I would under the circumstances quote in extense 
						only the additional grounds 1, 2, &amp; 3 which in my humble 
						estimation is the more comprehensive of the two.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;1. The trial court 
						erred when it held that section 34(2) of the NLCD.157 as 
						substituted by NLCD.342 provided a mandatory statutory 
						formula which employers and employees were bound to take 
						into account when negotiating in respect of the time 
						period that was to form the basis of the computation of 
						severance payments.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2. The trial High Court 
						erred when it held that article 36 of Exhibit &#8216;A&#8217; was 
						void as being inconsistent with the provision of section 
						34(2) of NLCD.257 as amended.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3. The trial High Court 
						erred when it upheld the plaintiffs claim for the 
						payment by the defendant company to each of them of 
						severance pay from the date each plaintiff commenced 
						work with the defendant company as employee to 31st 
						December, 1990.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Before proceeding to 
						determine the questions raised by these grounds of 
						appeal, we must, I think address an important 
						preliminary issue raised by the respondent to the 
						hearing of this appeal. The issue is would the appellant 
						failure to file a written submission of his case within 
						the time stipulated under the rules mean the said appeal 
						is deemed to have been struck out and there is therefore 
						no appeal pending with respect to this matter?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Court of Appeal 
						Rules, 1997, C.119 has been amended by C.125, by the 
						substitution for subrules (1), (2) and 19 of rule 20 
						with the following: &#8220;120(1). An appellant shall within 
						21 days of being notified in form 6 set out in part 1 of 
						the Schedule that the record is ready or within such 
						time as the court may upon terms direct, file with the 
						Registrar, a written submission of his case based on the 
						grounds of appeal set out in the notice of appeal and 
						such other grounds of appeal as he may file. Where the 
						appellant does not file the statement of his case in 
						accordance with subrule (1), the registrar shall certify 
						the failure to the court by a certificate as in Form 11A 
						in part 1 of the schedule and the court may upon that 
						order the appeal to be struck out.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">From the above amended 
						rules, I do not think there is an automatic &#8220;striking 
						out&#8221; or loss of an appeal, even in event of a 
						non-compliance with the rule 20(1) of C.I.19 as amended 
						by C.125. The subrule (2) enjoins the registrar as a 
						first step to certify the non-compliance to the court, 
						whereupon the court may (not shall) exercise the 
						striking out option. Therefore, even in cases where 
						there has been due notification of the non- compliance 
						to the court, (and that is not the position in this 
						instant case), the power conferred is permissive not 
						mandatory. However, on the facts of this case, the 
						registrar has not certified the non-compliance and this 
						court has made no order striking out the appeal. Since 
						the appeal has not been struck out, it must be deemed to 
						be pending. In any event, even if the invitation to 
						strike out is now being extended to us, I am not minded, 
						in the exercise of my discretion to apply this extreme 
						sanction. I think this penalty of stricking out an 
						appeal for non-compliance under rule 20(1) of C, 125 and 
						not hearing it on the merits must be exercised with 
						caution. It must be employed in plain and obvious cases 
						where in all the circumstances, it would be unjust to do 
						otherwise, circumstances I believe, like the period of 
						delay, the nature of the questions raised by the appeal 
						in question&#8212;its importance or otherwise etc. There are 
						ways by which a respondent who has suffered as a result 
						of a delay on the appellants part may be compensated and 
						the hearing expedited. In this instant case however the 
						following factors&#8212;the length of time this appeal has 
						been pending, but notably the serious and substitutial 
						questions of law raised by it, not to mention the 
						crucial fact that the respondents themselves upon being 
						served with the record complained about its 
						incompleteness and called for its rectification, have 
						constrained me from striking out the appeal. In any 
						case, it seems to me that it is implicit (in the rules) 
						that the 21 day limit under the rule, would begin to run 
						only where record of appeal is complete and faultless. 
						To my mind then, where a party, particularly respondent, 
						as happened in this instant case, complains to the 
						registrar or the court about ommissions or inaccuracies 
						in the record and demands that those be rectified, then 
						time ought not to run until either those anomalies have 
						been corrected, or the party withdraws his complaint or 
						the court subsequently rules that the omissions are not 
						fatal to the hearing of the appeal. The point I would 
						wish to emphasise is that until the question of the 
						incompleteness or otherwise of the record is settled, it 
						lies all in the mouth of that same complaint to turn 
						round and argue about his opponent&#8217;s non-compliance with 
						the twenty-day rule. I find no merit in the preliminary 
						point raised, and I dismiss it accordingly.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Two critical questions, 
						which same questions confronted the learned trial judge 
						are raised by the grounds A, B, C and additional grounds 
						1, 2, and 3. The principal question is whether article 
						36 of the collective agreement, Exhibit &#8216;A&#8217; under which 
						the respondents were paid their severance benefits, is 
						inconsistent with par.34 (2) of NLCD.157 as substituted 
						by NLCD. 342. Related to this question is this other 
						vital issue: whether or not the said provisions 
						prescribe a mandatory formula to be used in determining 
						the period in respect of which severance award is to be 
						paid. Put in Simpler terms, does the para.34 (2) of 
						NLCD.342 prescribe a formula for assessing severance 
						award?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Two arguments were 
						advanced in support of the criticism that the learned 
						trial judge (1) erred in her interpretation of the said 
						provision and (2) her final conclusion that 36 of 
						Exhibit &#8216;A&#8217; is inconsistent with para.34 (2) of 
						NLCD.342.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was submitted that 
						the said provisions does not lay down any formula, let 
						alone a mandatory formula for fixing the quantum of 
						severance award.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was urged that on 
						the contrary, it only prescribe a factor to be taken 
						into account in determing whether a person has suffered 
						a diminution in his/her terms and conditions of 
						employment such as would make him eligible for a 
						severance award.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Not unexpectedly, the 
						contrary argument advanced by the other side is that 
						that provision is a &#8220;determinant&#8221; provision in that it 
						lays down factors to be taken into consideration in 
						assessing the quantum of severance award. The argument 
						further was that opting for this construction, would 
						lead to the conclusion that article 36 of Exhibit &#8216;A&#8217; is 
						inconsistent with the express mandatory provisions of 
						the law and is consequently null and void.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">What then is the proper 
						construction to be placed on the law in question i.e. 
						par.34 (2) of the Labour Amendment Decree 1969 NRCD.342? 
						It stipulates: &#8220;Where an organisation is closed down or 
						where an organisation undergoes an arrangement or 
						amalgamation and the close down, arrangement or 
						amalgamation causes a severance of the legal 
						relationship between employee and employer between any 
						person and the organisation as it existed immediately 
						before the close down, arrangement or amalgamation, then 
						if, as a result of and in addition to such severance 
						that person becomes unemployed or suffers any diminition 
						in his terms and conditions of employment, he shall be 
						entitled to be paid by the organisation in whose 
						employment he was immediately prior to the close down, 
						arrangement or amalgamation, compensation in this 
						Decree, referred to as &#8220;severance pay&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) In determining 
						whether a person has suffered any diminution in his 
						terms and conditions of employment under sub paragraph 
						(1) of this paragraph account shall be taken of the past 
						service and accumulated benefits (if any) of such person 
						or in respect of his employment with the organisation 
						before it was closed down or before the arrangement or 
						the amalgamation.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is trite learning 
						that to obtain the true meaning of any enactment, or 
						indeed any document, it must be read as a whole. The 
						learned Ghanaian author, S.Y. Bimpong Buta in his 
						invaluable text book.&#8221; The Law of Interpretation in 
						Ghana (Exposition and Critique) has carefully spelt out 
						the rules that govern statutory interpretation in our 
						jurisdiction. Indeed his exposition of the rules are no 
						different from those expounded by other well known 
						English writers on the subject. Writing under the 
						heading: &#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Construction or 
						interpretation of statutes&#8221;, the learned author states 
						at page 36. &#8220;The traditional common law view is that 
						there are three basic rules of statutory interpretation: 
						the literal or plain meaning rule, the golden rule and 
						the mischief rule.&#8221; He expounds the first primary rule 
						further as follows at page 38. The salient features of 
						this basic rule (as stated) are the need to resort to 
						the ordinary, literal or dictionary meaning or where 
						necessary the technical meaning in relation to the 
						context in which the words or phrases have been used.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The settled law is 
						this: the primary rule of construction of statutes, to 
						which the others, namely the golden rule, and the 
						mischief rule are subordinate is that the words must 
						given their natural literal, ordinary or dictionary

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;It is the duty of a

						the intention of the legislature. Therefore, where words 
						in an enactment are clear and unambiguous no question of 
						interpretation arises, but where the ordinary meaning of 
						the words used leads to a manifest absurdity or 
						repugnancy, a court may alter the words of the

						absurdity or repugnancy.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Again, in the 
						unreported case of Kuenyehia &amp; Ors vrs: Archer and Ors 
						1992-93 GLR.1260 at 132, Bamford Addo JSC, supporting 
						the majority decision stated that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Broadly, the general 
						method of interpreting statutes or constitutions is to 
						give words their ordinary meaning and if the ordinary 
						meaning makes sense of the passage then the intention as 
						deduced from, must be given effect. It is only when the 
						construction leads to absurdity or is ambiguous that one 
						is required to look elsewhere or to resort to 
						application of certain other principles of 
						interpretation in order to ascertain the true meaning 
						and intention of the legislature.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In applying the first 
						primary rule to the law in question, I find the meaning 
						so plain and obvious it does not admit of any other 
						construction. To my mind, this law does not lay down the 
						factors to be taken into account in assessing or 
						determing the quantum of severance award. On the 
						contrary, what it does, in my view, is to emunerate 
						factors to be taken into account in determing the 
						question of who has suffered a diminution in terms and 
						conditions of service in terms of the proceedings 
						paragraph, para.34 (1) of NLCD.342, and is therefore 
						eligible for severance, award or the language of the 
						act, severance pay.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Indeed, an examination 
						of the proceeding par.34 (1) of NLCD.342 would remove 
						any doubts about the meaning of par.34 (2) (paragraph 
						34(1) re-read). Among its principal object as the 
						enactment itself states, is to identify persons who are 
						entitled to severance award or severance pay.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The enactment 
						identifies two such categories of persons, one of them 
						being the person who suffers a diminution in his terms 
						and conditions of employment. Thus, under para.34 (1) of 
						NLCD, 342 when an organisation in which employee&#8217;s work 
						is closed down or undergoes an arrangement or 
						amalgamation and the restructuring causes a severance of 
						the employment relationship and further as a result an 
						employee additionally suffers a reduction in his terms 
						and conditions of employment, he is by the clear 
						provisions of par.34 (1) of NLCD. 342 entitled to 
						&#8220;severance pay&#8221;. This is to be paid by the organisation 
						in whose employment he was prior to the restructuring. 
						The question of who has or has not suffered a diminution 
						in his terms and conditions of service therefore becomes 
						a critical one. And the S.34 (2) provides the answer to 
						this all important question. It lays down the factors to 
						be taken into account in resolving this issue. I am of 
						the opinion that the sub-paragraph (1) is so plain it 
						does not call for any secondary construction that is to 
						say an application of either the &#8220;golden&#8221; or &#8220;mischief&#8221; 
						rule as has been advocated by the respondent counsel. I 
						find that this clear meaning does not lead to any 
						absurdity, repugnancy, unreasonableness, hardship or 
						manifest injustice or the like such as would attract or 
						admit of any other construction. Indeed, the next 
						provision i.e. para.35 of the enactment reinforces the 
						point that sub para.34 (1) does not lay down the formula 
						for assessing the quantum of severance award at all but 
						it rather deals with the question of whether a person 
						has suffered a reduction diminution in terms and 
						conditions of employment and consequently is eligible 
						for severance award. Let me reproduce the par.35. It 
						stipulates.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The amount of any 
						severance pay to be paid under paragraph 34 of this 
						Decree as well as the terms under which payment is to be 
						made shall be matters for negotiation between the 
						employer or his representative and the employee or his 
						representative&#8221; (Emphasis mine).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Plainly, in my view, 
						the par.35 clearly stipulates that the quantum or the 
						severance award payable is entirely a matter for 
						negotiation between the parties or their 
						representatives. The law has not enumerated one single 
						statutory factor to be taken into account in this 
						assessment. At this hearing, we have been urged by 
						appellant counsel to additionally resort to a study of 
						the pre-enacting history of the legislation to arrive at 
						a true and proper construction of the law in question, 
						in this instant case the previous law which is par.35 of 
						NLCD.157. I concede that in our jurisdiction, 
						legislative history may also be used in interpreting 
						statutes. But it is a guide only that is an aid as 
						stated by his Lordship Francois, JSC. in his opinion in 
						Ali-Jiagge vrs: Inspector General of Police unreported 
						SC suit No. 16/81 26th March, 1990 namely:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;A cardinal aid to the 
						ascertainment of legislative intent is through the study 
						of the history of the particular enactment.&#8221; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">However, it is plain 
						from the legal texturiters that these aids and guides, 
						which are clearly distinguishable from the primary or 
						basic rules of interpretation are merely guides. They 
						are therefore truly our hand maids not our masters. 
						Thus, Benniou rationalises that &#8220;subject to relevant 
						legal rules, a court considering an enactment is master 
						of its own procedure and therefore has the power, indeed 
						the duty to consider such aspects of legislative history 
						of the enactment as may be necessary to arrive at its 
						meaning&#8221;. See section 208 titled &#8220;Legislative history as 
						a guide to construction at page 438 of &#8220;Statutory 
						Interpretation&#8221; (emphasis mine)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Again, Bimpong-Buta 
						cautions, and understandably so, that &#8220;these aids and 
						guides are not to be applied automatically: they merely 
						help the courts in determining the true meaning to be 
						placed on the statutory words or expressions. They are 
						therefore our servants not our masters. In other words, 
						if resort to these guides or aids may in themselves 
						create absurdity or unreasonableness the courts are to 
						avoid them altogether.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It seems to me then 
						that these aids or guides, described by Benion as 
						&#8220;interpretative criteria&#8221; becomes useful when for 
						example, the application of the meaning of the enactment 
						is somewhat obscure and the legislative history would 
						help unravel it. The converse then is that when the 
						meaning is plain and obvious or certain, indeed when an 
						application of the first primary rule of construction 
						leads to a just interpretation, no need arises to resort 
						to these guides. In much the same way that reading 
						glasses are not meant for those whose eyesight is good, 
						but for those with weak or impaired eyesight, 
						legislative or pre-enactment history becomes useful when 
						the meaning of the enactment is shrounded in obscurity.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this instant case 
						therefore, while I conceded pre-enacting history has a 
						rightful place in the construction of statutes, I find 
						the meaning of par.34 (2) so clear, I cannot justify the 
						use of it. In conclusion I would agree with appellant 
						counsel that the learned trial judge erred in her 
						construction of par.34 (2) of NLCD.342.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The additional ground 5 
						states that &#8220;The Trial High Court Judge erred when he 
						held that there was an omission in para.34 (2) of 
						NLCD.157 as amended for the alleged reason that the 
						provision failed to take account of workers who suffer 
						total loss of employment as opposed to those who only 
						suffer diminution in terms and conditions of employment 
						and the court was in duty bound to rectify the omission 
						in order to avoid unjust or absurd consequences.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The main argument in 
						support of this ground is that the learned trial judges 
						primary finding that an omission exists in the 
						legislation is fundamentally wrong for the law actually 
						does provide for these persons complained of i.e. those 
						people who became totally unemployed, following a 
						restructuring exercise. The argument therefore was that 
						the court had no factual or legal basis for rectifying 
						the law by the insertion of such words as would in the 
						judges estimation lead to the desired result, which was 
						the removal of absurdity and injustice. The contrary 
						submission by the respondent counsel is that the learned 
						trial judge rightly found an omission in the law and was 
						perfectly justified in the step she took.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">My views are these. 
						Firstly, I think that the argument that par.34(2) of 
						NLCD 324 does not provide for severance pay for 
						employees who suffer total unemployment as a result of 
						or following the closure, rearrangement, or amalgamation 
						of the organisation in which he works is inaccurate. A 
						careful reading of the law in question proves the 
						contrary (paragraph 34(2) re-read). Such an employee is 
						also by the par.35 empowered to negotiate his severance 
						award. Contrary to respondent learned counsel&#8217;s 
						contention therefore, I find no absurdity, injustice, or 
						contradiction of the legislative intent, or hardship or 
						injustice such as would justify our reading words into 
						the enactment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I had occasion to 
						examine the scope of par.34 (2) of NLCD.342 in the 
						unreported case of Civil Appeal No.36/97 titled Gabriel 
						Deku &amp; Ors. vrs: Tema Food Complex Corporation dated 5th 
						February, 1998. My pronouncement on the issue of whether 
						or not par.34 (2) does provide for the payment of 
						severance award to those who suffer a total loss of 
						employment as a result of a restructing exercise is to 
						say the least of persuasive authority and has helped me 
						answer this question in the affirmative. This is what I 
						said in the Deku case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Employees in any 
						organisation which is closed down or which undergoes any 
						arrangement or amalgamation, may be affected by the 
						exercise in three different ways. There may be those 
						whose terms and conditions remain unaffected by the 
						exercise. Indeed it may well be that the same may profit 
						by the new arrangement, as for example when the employee 
						begins to enjoy an increase in salary and better 
						conditions of service. We are not in this appeal 
						concerned with such group of employees. What we are 
						concerned with are indeed those employees the Labour 
						Amendment Decree 234 seeks to protect, those who as a 
						result of the severance of the employment relationship.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1. Become altogether 
						unemployed, or</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2. those who escape 
						this misfortune and</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3. remains employed, 
						yet suffers a diminition in terms and conditions of 
						employment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Upon a plain reading of 
						the S.34 (1) of the NLCD.324 such persons shall be 
						entitled to severance pay. However as rightly argued by 
						both counsel, the S.35 of the NLCD.324 stipulates that 
						for both group of persons, the quantum as well as the 
						terms under which such payment shall be group of 
						persons, the quantum as well as the terms under which 
						such payment shall be made, shall be matters for 
						negotiation between the employer and employee or their 
						representative.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">But even so, assuming 
						there was a clear omission on the part of the 
						legislature, and the law did not make provision for 
						those who suffer total loss of employment, I 
						nevertheless do not think it was right for the learned 
						trial judge to supply all such necessary words in order 
						to bring them into its ambit. What the learned trial 
						judge did in my view, amounted to a clear usurpation of 
						legislative power. The legal position is that at common 
						law, courts are empowered to &#8220;alter, or effect an 
						emendation of words in a statute by adding to these even 
						to ignore the express words altogether&#8221; (See 
						Bimpong-Buta the law of Interpretation in Ghana par.5, 
						page 57.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">But this power, as the 
						legal authorities, especially the legal textwriters who 
						wrote extensively on the subject show, is very limited 
						in scope. So, as pointed out by Buta, the purpose is to 
						avoid &#8220;unintelligibility unreasonableness or absurdity.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Cross, another 
						celebrated author thinks likewise. In his book 
						&#8220;Interpretation of Statutes&#8221; 3rd Edition page 93 he 
						deals with the subject under the heading:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Reading words in an 
						out of a statute&#8221;: He also states:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The judge may read 
						words which he considers necessarily implied by words 
						which are already in the statute and he has a limited 
						power to add to, alter or ignore statutory words in 
						order to prevent a provision from being unintelligible, 
						unworkable, absurd or totally unreasonable, with the 
						rest of the statute.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Words may be 
						necessarily implied by other words when their express 
						statement merely clarifies a secondary meaning of these 
						other words.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Further at page 99 the 
						learned author delimits the power as such:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The power to add to, 
						alter or ignore statutory words is an extremely limited 
						one. Generally speaking it can only be exercised where 
						there has been a demonstrable mistake on the part of the 
						drafter or where the consequence of applying the words 
						in their ordinary or discernible secondary meaning would 
						be utterly unreasonable.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Again, the very 
						textwriter upon whom the respondent counsel relies on in 
						support of his argument confirms the limited scope of 
						the rule. Also writing under the heading &#8220;Omission&#8221; 
						(Maxwell on Interpretation&#8221; page 241), the learned 
						author states:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;An omission which the 
						context shows with reasonable certainty to have been 
						unintended may be supplied at least in enactments which 
						are construed beneficially, as distinguished from 
						strictly&#8221; we learn from him that, the modification may 
						be done only where the enactment itself had, in the 
						first place received, a beneficial and not a strict 
						construction, as have been done in this instant case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Useful decided cases on 
						the point are: &#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1. Republic vrs: 
						Barnett London Borongh Council, Ex-parte Shah 1983 2 
						AC.309.</span></p>

						<span style="font-family: Arial">3. Federal Steam 
						Navigation Co., Ltd. vrs: Department of Trade and 
						Industry 1974 2 AE.97. Lord Reids spells out at some 
						instances in which the rule applies as follows at page 
						100 of the Federal Steam case. He opined: &#8220;Cases where 
						it has properly been held that a word can be struck out 
						of a deed or statute and another substituted can as far 
						as I am aware be grouped under three heads: where 
						without such substitution the provision is 
						unintelligible of absurd or totally unreasonable, where 
						it is unworkable: and where it is totally irreconcilable 
						with the plain intention shown by the rest of the deed 
						or statute.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I therefore think that 
						in the construction of statutes, we need to draw a clear 
						distinction between cases where a law has clearly and 
						deliberately not provided for any given situation or set 
						of circumstances and those other cases where an 
						unintended omission results in the situation identified 
						by the authorities&#8212;namely unintelligibility, absurdity, 
						unworkability or unreasonableness and the like or in the 
						case of an enactment which has been beneficially 
						construed, a reasonable certainty exists from the 
						context that the omission was unintentional. I think 
						that in the latter class of cases, alterations or 
						emendations of the statute either by the addition of or 
						the taking out of words may be allowed. But, I do not 
						think the same would be permitted in the former class of 
						cases. My thinking is that it is not the duty of the 
						courts to supply words in order to rectify such 
						anomalies. This simple illustration would clearify the 
						point I have made. Suppose an enactment under which 
						different categories of persons are tried expressly make 
						provision for the right of appeal to only some and not 
						all those who could be tried under that law. I do not 
						think we would be right in saying &#8220;what a wicked and 
						unjust law, we would fill in all the necessary missing 
						words in order to extend that right of appeal to these 
						also who have not been mentioned&#8221;. My view is that so 
						long as the ordinary meaning of that enactment is plain 
						on the face and can be ascertained, the best a court can 
						do in the circumstances is to draw attention to the 
						injustice in the hope that it would be corrected by the 
						lawmakers. In my opinion, the alleged omission by the 
						learned trial judge case is not the type that justifies 
						a court&#8217;s intervention.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I would reiterate that 
						it was thus not open to the learned trial judge to 
						insert any words in the enactment.&nbsp; The respondents are 
						not entitled to judgment, when the undisputed evidence 
						also is that they have in accordance with the law, 
						negotiate for and have been paid their severance award. 
						I think these grounds of appeal I have dealt with are so 
						fundamental they do resolve this appeal in the 
						appellants favour, and consequently no useful purpose 
						would be served by dealing with the additional ground 
						&#8216;4&#8217;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">By the original ground 
						5, and the complaint and which I am inclined to agree 
						with, is that the costs awarded were excessive.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						award of costs. The appellate courts are always slow to 
						interfere with costs awarded by the courts for first

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The only points I wish 
						to repeat for the sake of emphasis are these:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Article 36 of the 
						Collective Agreement, exhibit &#8216;A&#8217;, states simply that 
						Severance payment for unionized employees shall be 
						calculated as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Two (2) months 
						consolidated basic pay for each year of service 
						effective 1st January, 1991&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The entire case 
						revolves around this clause. What is to be noted 
						carefully about this clause is that it has no 
						precondition, proviso, or requirement to be satisfied 
						before it will be implemented. It is a categorical 
						statement which sets out the number of months to be used 
						to calculate the amount to be paid, i.e. two months: 
						Secondly, it links the compensation to two months of 
						&#8220;the consolidated basic pay for each year of service;&#8221; 
						In other words, for every year that an employee has 
						worked for the appellant company, two months&#8217; salary for 
						that year will be set aside and added together to make 
						up what has to be paid as severance compensation. These 
						create no particular problems.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The real bone of 
						contention is the phrase &#8220;EFFECTIVE 1st JANUARY, 1991&#8221; 
						Within Article 36 of exhibit A, what is the meaning to 
						be given to this phrase? To my mind, all it means is 
						that whatever amount is to be paid is to be calculated 
						from 1st January, 1991. It is the phrase which limits 
						the period of payment to be worked out from 1st January, 
						1991. I do not believe that the clause lends itself to 
						any other interpretation.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The respondents&#8217; case 
						is based on the interpretation which assumes that the 
						phrase &#8220;effective 1st January, 1991&#8221; was not part of the 
						clause. In fact if there were no such limiting time 
						phrase, they would have been right. However, so long as 
						the phrase remained part of the clause, payment of the 
						severance compensation should be limited to the period 
						starting from 1st January, 1991. If the period is 
						limited to 1st January, 1991, then there is no basis for 
						the claim to be paid from the day each employee started 
						working with the appellant company. The reason is simply 
						that that is what the parties bargained for and that is 
						what they are entitled to.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">That takes me to the 
						next point. Exhibit &#8216;A&#8217;, like all collective agreements 
						in this country, is the end product of negotiations 
						between the employers, i.e. the appellant company and 
						the unionized workers represented by their trade union 
						officials, in the instant case, the Industrial and 
						Commercial Workers Union of the Trades Union Congress. 
						It was in the course of the negotiations that the 
						parties agreed on the period of 1st January, 1991. The 
						parties appended their signatures to the agreement, 
						fully cognizant of the fact that severance pay was to be 
						calculated from 1st January, 1991. That agreement is 
						binding on all the parties to exhibit&nbsp; &#8216;A&#8217;. On the face 
						of clause 36 of exhibit &#8216;A&#8217;, there is no basis for 
						asking that payment should be extended to the period 
						when each employee started working for the company. If 
						that was what the workers desired but was not inserted 
						in the agreement, then they have their representatives 
						to blame for not ensuring that their intentions were 
						duly reproduced in the agreement. Collective agreement 
						is a form of contract and the sanctity of contracts is a 
						principle, which must be honoured by all parties, who 
						freely and voluntarily enters into any contract, like 
						the instant exhibit &#8216;A&#8217;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Another obvious point 
						raised in this appeal relates to the issues of the 
						application of the collective agreement to senior staff 
						members. At the beginning of the case in the High Court 
						and in this court, the respondents argued that exhibit 
						&#8216;A&#8217; applied equally to both senior and junior staff 
						members. That was obviously not correct. Collective 
						agreements are negotiated on behalf of unionized members 
						of staff. That is why TUC officials represent the 
						workers. Senior staff members are not union members. 
						They therefore cannot be represented by those officials. 
						The judgement of the trial court was defective in so far 
						that it treated senior members of staff on the same 
						basis as junior staff on the application of the 
						collective agreement. It was not surprising that later, 
						at the end of the trial and in a motion to adduce fresh 
						evidence, the same respondents and the applicant therein 
						argued that exhibit &#8216;A&#8217; no longer applied to senior 
						officers. That point was made while their earlier 
						arguments on the application to senior staff still 
						remained on the record before this court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In commenting on this 
						point, I am not unmindful of the fact that the 
						respondents attempted to link article 36 of Exhibit &#8216;A&#8217; 
						with paragraph 34(2) of NRCD.342. I hold the view that 
						the two articles cannot correctly be linked together and 
						I adopt all the reasons given in the judgment of the 
						President on this issue. Paragraph 34(2) deals with 
						eligibility, i.e. who qualifies to be paid severance 
						compensation. It does not deal with the basis for 
						calculating severance pay. It is rather article 36 which 
						deals with the basis for calculating payment of 
						severance compensation. The two provisions are not the 
						same.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The last point which I 
						wish to comment upon is on the issue of costs. The costs 
						awarded at the trial court are extremely on the high 
						side, even if all the work involved and the time taken 
						to try the case are considered.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There is no need to 
						belabour the point at this juncture because the 
						respondents in this court have lost the case by the 
						unanimous decision of this panel. They are entitled to 
						nothing. Costs cannot be awarded to parties who lose the 
						case, like the respondents herein.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appeal succeeds and 
						should be allowed.</span></p>

						<span style="font-family: Arial">JUSTICE OF APPEAL</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">TWUMASI, J.A.;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trust of this 
						appeal is the true meaning of the provisions of the 
						Labour (AMENDMENT) Decree 1969 (NLCD.342). The High 
						Court Tema preferred the construction placed upon the 
						statute by the respondents and rejected the view of the 
						appellant as to the true meaning and import of the 
						statute. The court therefore gave judgment for the 
						respondents.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Against that judgment 
						the appellant has filed a number of grounds of appeal. 
						The facts of the case could be briefly stated for the 
						purpose of shedding some light on the issues of law 
						involved. Sometime in June, 1994 the appellant company 
						embarked upon a restructuring exercise, which affected a 
						sizeable number of the labour force in terms of job- 
						losses. The respondents were among those workers who 
						lost their jobs on grounds of redundancy. Under and by 
						virtue of the collective agreement then in force, all 
						those declared redundant were paid compensation referred 
						to in the said agreement as &#8220;severance pay&#8221; in 
						accordance with article 36 of the said agreement. The 
						latter article had provided that each worker who had 
						lost his job was entitled to be paid two (2) months 
						consolidated basis pay for each year of service. The 
						collective agreement, however, had limited the period 
						for severance pay for the purposes of its computation, 
						to a specific date, which was 1st January. 1991, 
						irrespective of the date and year a particular worker 
						commenced work with the appellant company prior to 1st 
						January, 1991. In real terms, therefore, if for example 
						worker X commenced his services for the appellant on the 
						31st December, 1990 he was not given severance pay from 
						that date and year to the 1st January, 1991. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This collective 
						agreement was negotiated and concluded by two parties, 
						namely the appellant company as employer for the one 
						part and the junior staff, junior workers through their 
						accredited representatives, namely, the Industrial and 
						Commercial Workers Union (ICU) of the Trades Union 
						Congress (TUC) of Ghana for the other part. The record 
						of appeal reveals, however, that the beneficiaries of 
						the severance pay made by the appellant company included 
						the senior staff workers who were affected by the 
						exercise. Sometime after payment of the severance pay to 
						them, the respondents raised a fresh issue. Their claim 
						was that great injustice had been meted out to them by 
						their employers, the appellant company. They contended 
						that the terms of the collective agreement which 
						deprived them of severance pay for the period of service 
						prior to the 1st January, 1991, was unlawful. They 
						therefore instituted an action in the High Court, Tema 
						claiming the following reliefs: &#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1) Payment of each 
						plaintiff&#8217;s severance compensation with effect from the 
						date each plaintiff commenced work with Defendant 
						company as employee up to 31st December, 1970.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) Interest at 
						prevailing bank rate from 1st February, 1994 to date.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(3) An order directing 
						the Defendants to immediately negotiate severance 
						compensation with the plaintiff for the period of 
						service of each plaintiff before 1st January, 1991 
						failing which the court should itself determine a fair 
						and just compensation for the period concerned.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In their statement of 
						claim the respondents averred in paragraphs 8 &amp; 9 
						thereof the following:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) Plaintiffs say that 
						even though they were one and all, entitled to severance 
						compensation upon the event of the restructuring 
						arrangement referred to in paragraph 7 they were each 
						paid severance pay only with effect from 1st January, 
						1991 and the previous service of each plaintiff before 
						1st January, 1991 was unlawfully ignored.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(9) Plaintiffs say that 
						severance pay is statutorily imposed under NLCD.342 and 
						could therefore not lawfully have been restricted to 1st 
						January, 1991.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Since the NLCD.342 is 
						the focal point of all disputes or questions of law that 
						need to be canvassed, it is necessary to identify its 
						provisions by reproducing the entire statute. It is 
						provided under sections 34 and 35 of the labour 
						(Amendment) Decree 1969 NLCD.342 that: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">34(1) Where an 
						organisation is closed down or where an organisation 
						undergoes an arrangement or amalgamation and the 
						closedown, arrangement or amalgamation causes a 
						severance of the legal relationship of employee and 
						employer between any person and the organisation as it 
						existed immediately before the close down, arrangement 
						or amalgamation, then, if as a result of or in addition 
						to such severance that person becomes unemployed or 
						suffers any diminution in his terms and conditions of 
						employment, he shall be entitled to be paid by the 
						organisation in whose employment he was immediately 
						before the close down, arrangement or amalgamation, 
						compensation, in this Decree referred to as &#8220;severance 
						pay&#8221;. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) In determining 
						whether a person has suffered any diminution in his

						(1) of this paragraph, account shall be taken of the

						person in or in respect of his employment with the

						occurrence of the arrangement or amalgamation:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(35) The amount of any 
						severance pay to be paid under paragraph 34 of this 
						Decree as well as the terms under which payment is to be 
						made shall be matters for negotiation between the 
						employer or his representative and the employee or his 
						representative&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The legal submissions 
						made by counsel for the respondents on the proper 
						construction of the provisions of this decree found 
						favour with the learned trial High Court Judge. The 
						following excerpts from the judgment appear at p.52 of 
						the record of appeal:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Under and by virtue of 
						the Labour (Amendment) Decree 1969 (NLCD.342) Section 
						34(2) in determining the amount of any severance pay to 
						be paid as severance award account shall be taken of the 
						past services and accumulated benefits (if any) of such 
						person in or in respect of his employment with the 
						organisation before it was closed down or before the 
						occurrence of the arrangement or the amalgamation. Even 
						though section 35 of NLCD makes the quantum of any 
						severance award and the terms thereof to be subject of 
						negotiation, the negotiation should be conducted bearing 
						in mind the mandatory provisions of section 34(2) of 
						NLCD.342. Section 34(2) makes no direct reference to 
						employees who suffer total loss of employment like 
						plaintiffs in this case. Did the lawmakers intend to 
						omit this class from benefiting or was it an 
						inadvertment omission? Mr. Jones Mensah submitted that 
						it was an omission and that employees who suffer total 
						loss were intended to benefit. He urged the court to so 
						hold. I am persuaded that this is a fitting case to so 
						hold.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel for the 
						appellant in his written statement of case argued 
						together on simultaneously original grounds (A), (B) and 
						(C) and additional grounds (1), (2) and (3). The first 
						of the submissions was that the learned trial judge 
						erred by holding that article 36 of the Collective 
						Agreement (Exhibit &#8216;A&#8217;) was void as being inconsistent 
						with the provisions of paragraphs 34 and 35 of the 
						Labour Decree 1967 (NLCD.157) as amended by the Labour 
						(Amendment) Decree 1967 (NLCD.342). This decree has been 
						reproduced above and it is clear that the sticking 
						points or, put more robustly, the centrifugal point is 
						paragraph 34 sub-paragraph (2) thereof. Counsel for the 
						appellant company argued that, upon proper construction 
						the provision was clearly intended to prescribe a number 
						of factors to be taken into account in determining 
						whether a person who works in an organisation that has 
						been closed down or has undergone reorganisation or 
						amalgamation has suffered any diminution in his terms 
						and conditions of employment immediately before such 
						closure or reorganisation or amalgamation. I wish to 
						quote his submission as follows: &#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Section 34(2) as 
						provided under NLCD.342 only preserves in simple terms 
						the point of the proviso in the old section 34, namely 
						that in determining whether a person has suffered 
						diminution in his terms as conditions of employment on 
						account of an arrangement, amalgamation etc account is 
						to be taken of his past services and accumulated 
						benefits (if any), The provision of section 34(2), to 
						repeat, is then to help determine who has suffered 
						diminution in his terms and conditions of employment 
						such that he qualifies for severance pay&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the relevance of 
						pre-enacting history as an aid to interpretation he 
						cited the case of USA Government vrs: Jennings (1983) 1 
						AC.624 at 641 and Bennion on Statutory Interpretation 
						2nd edition at pp.438 - 440. Arguing contrariwise 
						counsel for the respondents submitted in his statement 
						of case the following: &#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Thus the phrase in 
						determining whether a person has suffered any diminution 
						in his terms and conditions of employment under 
						subparagraph (l) of this paragraph...it makes sense if 
						the word &#8220;whether&#8221; is understood to read and mean &#8220;how 
						much&#8221; or the extent to which past service related to 
						suffering. A meaningful rephrasing of the phrase in 
						question in order to achieve the lawmaker&#8217;s intention 
						can be a supported reading as follows: &#8220;In determing to 
						what extent or how much a person has suffered any 
						diminution in his condition of employment, account shall 
						be taken of past service.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In support of this 
						submission Counsel referred the court to a number of 
						legal authorities including Yorkshire Fire Insurance Co. 
						vrs: Clayton (1881) 8 QBD. 421; Courts vrs: Stonvin 
						(1889) 22 QBD.513; Duke of Bucclench 1889) 15 P.D.86; R. 
						vrs: Bishop of Otfirst (1876) QBD,245 at 252 Whitney 
						vrs: 1 RC (1926) Ac.37. All these cases dealt with one 
						fact or the other of the golden rule of statutory 
						interpretation with particular reference to the power of 
						the court to modify a statute to achieve apparent 
						legislative intention. He cited other cases to the same 
						effect namely, In re Brockelbank, ex-parte Dunn and 
						Rueburn (1889) QBD.461; Lyson vrs: Andrew Stuart vrs: 
						Nixons Bruce (1900) A.C.79 and last but not the least 
						Counsel referred to learned commentary at p.36 - 42 of 
						&#8220;The Law of Interpretation in Ghana&#8221; 1st Edition by S.Y. 
						Bimpong-Buta on the topic construction or Interpretation 
						of Statutes. The learned author quoted with approval a 
						passage from the case Grey vrs: Person (1957) HLC.61 at 
						106 where Lord Wenslegdale stated that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;In construing wills 
						and indeed states and all written documents, the 
						grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be 
						adherred to unless that would lead to some absurdity, or 
						some repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the 
						instrument, in which case the grammatical and ordinary 
						sense of the words may be modified so as to avoid the 
						absurdity and inconsistency but to no farther.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It would no doubt be 
						appreciated that here Lord Wansleydale was virtually 
						re-echoing the golden rule as enunciated by Parke &#8216;B&#8217; in 
						Becke vrs: Smith (1836) 2 Meeson &amp; Welsby 191 at 195 
						(infra), Counsel for the appellant rejects the tendency 
						to insert words into the decree and cautions against it 
						by a quotation from Cross&#8217; Interpretation of Statutes 
						3rd Edition p.99 that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The power to add to, 
						alter or ignore statutory words is an extremely limited 
						one, it can only be exercised where there has been 
						&#8220;demonstrable mistake on the part of the drafter or 
						where the consequences of applying the words in their 
						ordinary or discernible secondary meaning would be 
						utterly unreasonable.&#8221; The contribution which counsel in 
						this appeal have endeavoured to make to assist this 
						court in finding the proper intention or object of the 
						lawmaker in enacting sub-paragraph 2 of paragraph 34 of 
						the NLCD could be stated in a few words or statements. 
						Counsel for the appellant contends that the 
						sub-paragraph means exactly what the words used say and 
						nothing else. He elaborates that all that the words mean 
						is that they are intended as a factor or criterion for 
						determining whether a particular worker has suffered a 
						diminution in his terms of employment. He says that once 
						that issue is determined, then that worker qualifies to 
						be paid compensation or severance pay, otherwise he is 
						not entitled. Where the worker passes that test, his 
						right to demand his compensation accrues to him under 
						paragraph 35 which provides that the amount of 
						compensation shall be determined through negotiation by 
						the accredited representatives of the workers on the one 
						part and the employer on the other. Counsel for the 
						respondents for his part contends that the sub-paragraph 
						is a formula for determining &#8220;the extent to which or how 
						much a person has suffered any diminution in his 
						conditions of employment.&#8221; He argues that if the decree 
						says that past services should be taken into account in 
						this determination, then it is the duty of the court to 
						grant severance payment for past services to workers who 
						lost their employment. By this argument he questions the 
						legality of article 36 of the collective agreement, 
						Exhibit &#8216;A&#8217;, for cutting off the years prior to January, 
						1991 and thereby depriving the joblosers their due 
						compensation for their past services. In short, he 
						contends that there is some injustice, which cries for 
						remedy, and he implores this court to provide the remedy 
						through the mechanism of statutory construction.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As it is customary of 
						me, I go back to basics and my starting point is the 
						principle or rule of statutory interpretation which 
						insists that statutes must be looked at as a whole. This 
						is the holistic approach. It requires that every 
						paragraph or sub-paragraph of a statute is to be 
						construed with reference to the other parts or 
						paragraphs of the statute in order to make a consistent 
						and homogenous enactment of the whole statute. This 
						option requires that individual words or phrases or 
						sentences, which may occur in the statute, must not be 
						construed in isolation. Also, the meaning of one 
						paragraph may have interaction with another and care 
						must be taken to avoid ignoring such relationships if a 
						true and correct meaning of the statute as a whole is to 
						be achieved: See Asamoah vrs: The Republic (1972) GLR. 
						117; Ababio vrs: The Republic (1972) 1 GLR.347 and the 
						English cases Canada sugar Refining Co. Ltd. vrs: Rex 
						(1898) AC.735 per Lord Derby at p.741. Fortunately, the 
						brevity of the NLCD.342 has made it possible for me to 
						reproduce all its parts. The next face is the golden 
						rule of interpretation what I term the pious approach. 
						In the celebrated English case of Becke vrs: Smith 
						(1836) 2 Meeson &amp; Welsby) 191 at p.195 Parke &#8216;B&#8217; said:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;It is a very useful 
						rule in the construction of a statute, to adhere to the 
						ordinary meaning of the words used, and to the 
						grammatical construction, unless that is at variance 
						with the intention of the legislature, to be collected 
						from the statute itself, or leads to any manifest 
						absurdity or repugnance, in which case the language may 
						be varied or modified, so as to avoid such 
						inconvenience, but to no further.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The golden rule was 
						applied by our Court of Appeal in the case of Ghana 
						Muslims Representative Council vrs: Salifu (1975) 2 
						GLR.246 in the construction of the legislative object of 
						Act.106. The Supreme Court used the rule in Essilfie 
						vrs: Anafo (1992) 2 GLR.654 to interpret the word 
						&#8220;action&#8221; and whether &#8220;action&#8221; included an &#8220;appeal&#8221; 
						within the purview of the Supreme Court Rules 1970 
						(C.I.13) rules 13(1) and (2) and 66(1). The issue was 
						whether a party whose appeal had been struck out for 
						failure to file a statement of case within time could be 
						granted extension of time to file the statement. Lastly 
						in another recent case. Quaynor vrs: Quarshie, dated 3rd 
						February, 2000 unreported the Court of Appeal construed 
						the meaning of a child under 18 years of age under 
						section 13(1) of the Wills Act, 1971 (Act. 360) to 
						include a physically and mentally incapacitated child 
						above the age of eighteen years to enable him benefit 
						from a judicially-apportioned reasonable provision out 
						of the estate of his deceased father who had 
						disinherited him by his will. On the question as to the 
						power of the court to incorporate into the body of an 
						enactment words or phrases of its own for the purpose of 
						advancing the perceived legislative intention so as to 
						avoid injustice, let us examine and benefit from a 
						statement by the Honourable Justice Taylor, J.S.C. (as 
						he then was) in Sam vrs: Comptroller of Customs and 
						Excise (1971) 1 GLR.289 at 309 that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Apparently one can 
						alter the words of a statute but this is a serious 
						matter and it must be for only very cogent and limited 
						reasons indeed. As Bramwell B. said in Fredericks vrs: 
						Payne (1862) 1 HSC [Hurlstone &amp; Ciltman] 584 at 589 (my 
						emphasis). The introduction of words into an Act of 
						Parliament is open to serious objections, and should 
						only be resorted to for the most cogent reasons, so as 
						to avoid a repugnancy of construction or something which 
						is opposed to good sense.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The policy rationale 
						behind this statutory judicial restraint is the 
						acceptance of the presumption that the parliamentary 
						draftsman has obsequiously reduced into writing exactly 
						what the lawmaker intended to convey by the statute and 
						further and more importantly that parliament will not 
						intend what is unjust or inconvenient. See Artemiou vrs: 
						Procopiou (1966) 1 QB.878 per Dankwerts LJ at p.888 
						(Maxwell in interpretation of Statutes 12th edition 
						p.199)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It follows therefore 
						that where a party alleges that there is an omission or 
						some other provision of a statute causes any ambiguity 
						warranting alteration of a word, phrase or a sentence in 
						the statute, the onus rests upon him to establish what 
						in his view the true intention of the legislature is and 
						to prove to the satisfaction of the court that such 
						word, phrase or sentence used in the statute is in 
						conflict with the legislative intention and consequently 
						repugnant to good sense and justice unless it is altered 
						by the court. In my understanding of interpretation of 
						statutes it is a corollary to the literal construction 
						approach to restrict the interpreter to the meaning of 
						the words and phrases used by the draftsman and to 
						reject facile suggestions for insertions of extraneous 
						matters, so it is a corollary to the general rule of the 
						liberal interpretation that there should be a degree of 
						permissiveness to alter statutes, but the bottom line or 
						the upshot of it all, in my view, must be not to arrive 
						at a conclusion which would stultify the efficiency of 
						legislation. Armed with this background learning of the 
						fundamental principles and rules of statutory 
						interpretation and after due cogitation over the issues 
						in this case, I would proceed to express my candid 
						opinion on the Labour (Amendment) Decree 1969 NLCD.342. 
						The legislature of this country in its wisdom and with 
						obvious interest in the welfare of the labour sector of 
						the economy identified two categories of workers and 
						invested them with the right to compensation called 
						&#8220;severance pay&#8221; under section 34(1) of the NLCD.342&#8221;. 
						These two categories were: &#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1) Those who lost 
						their employment (i.e. job losers)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) Those who suffered 
						any diminution in their terms and conditions of 
						employment as a result of any restructuring. To lose a 
						job is to leave your office because your name is 
						automatically deleted from the pay-roll. In short, you 
						pack bag and baggage and go out to look for another 
						employment or employ yourself somewhere or else starve 
						to death.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is always the lot 
						of a job loser. These workers then have to get in touch 
						with the appropriate authorities for the payment of 
						their severance pay and if settled they go in peace. All 
						they need to is to show the authorities that they were 
						among those declared redundant as a result of the 
						restructuring exercise. But the position is not so 
						simple and straightforward with the second category of 
						workers.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Some preliminary and 
						crucial exercise would have to be made before those 
						persons are identified. On what basis or criterion can 
						it be concluded that worker X or worker Y who has been 
						retained in the new organisation has suffered any 
						diminution in his terms and conditions of service as a 
						result of the new change? The most sensible approach is 
						to compare the terms and conditions in his employment 
						before the change with those of the new set up and to 
						ascertain whether he has been worse off in any terms and 
						conditions in the latter. If the answer is Yes, then he 
						would have to be compensated by severance pay. This must 
						be within the competence of experts in labour, 
						industrial and employer-employee matters. In short, it 
						is an administrative function for such experts either 
						within or engaged externally by the new organisation. In 
						my view, this is the task with which section 34(2) of 
						the NLCD,342 is concerned. The subsection, however, 
						makes it mandatory that in determining whether a worker 
						who has been retained has suffered a diminution in his 
						terms and conditions of service or employment in the new 
						organisation are worse than they were before &#8220;account 
						shall be taken of his past services and accumulated 
						benefits&#8221;. This is to say that account shall be taken of 
						his past services and accumulated benefits along with 
						the main considerations to be adopted for the 
						determination of that issue of whether the particular 
						worker has suffered any diminution: I have never 
						understood the subsection to be bearing a legislative 
						object of determining the amount of compensation payable 
						to persons who have suffered diminution. The 
						determination of the amount of such compensation 
						squarely falls within the purview of section 35 of the 
						NLCD.342. Clearly the learned trial judge made a detour 
						and therefore erred grievously when she construed the 
						subsection to be concerned with the determination of the 
						amount of severance pay.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">With this misconception 
						of the law imperceptibly at the back of her mind, the 
						learned trial judge's misapprehension deepened into 
						another error of thinking that there had been grave 
						injustice meted out to those workers who had lost their 
						jobs by the legislature by omitting to enact a provision 
						that the past services of such workers should also be 
						taken into account. If some financial or other benefit 
						had been given to those who suffered diminution but the 
						total job losers had been denied similar deal then of 
						course one could say that the legislature had omitted 
						something crucial, but this is not the position with 
						regard to subsection(2) of section 34 of the NLCD. 342. 
						A recourse to the old law, that is the law as it was 
						before the amendment, now subject of interpretation 
						would doubtlessly shed enormous light on the true 
						interpretation of the amendment and to that end I 
						reproduce the old sections 34 and 35 of the Labour 
						Decree 1967 NLCD.157 as follows: &#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(34) (1) Where an 
						organisation is closed down, or reorganised or 
						amalgamated with another organisation under a new name 
						or on a change of ownership, the workers in such 
						organisation shall be entitled to severance pay for loss 
						of employment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Provided that no 
						severance pay shall be payable to any worker in the case 
						of a reorganisation or amalgamation where the new body 
						arising out of the reorganisation or amalgamation 
						undertakes to employ the worker on terms and conditions 
						which are the same or as or more favourable to the 
						worker than the terms and conditions upon which the 
						worker was employed immediately before the 
						reorganisation or amalgamation, so however that amount 
						shall be taken of his past service and other accumulated 
						benefits.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(35) The conditions 
						under which severance pay and the amount of such pay 
						that shall be payable, shall be matters for negotiation 
						between the employer or his representative and the 
						worker or representative.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is crystal clear 
						that the pre-amended law provided an answer for workers 
						who had been retained in the new establishment but whose 
						terms and conditions of employment had not suffered any 
						diminution. The answer was unambiguous; namely, that 
						they were not entitled compensation. That was the 
						proviso to section 34. The converse of that provision 
						was simple logic. It was that those who suffered 
						diminution in their terms and conditions of employment 
						as a result of the restructuring exercise qualified for 
						payment of compensation.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the amended 
						enactment or decree the focus of attention was drawn to 
						those of the latter category of workers because the case 
						of those who would suffer no diminution did not pose any 
						problem requiring a procedure for its solution or 
						determination. Accordingly, the proviso was redrafted in 
						sub-section (2) of section 34 of NLCD.342 in a simpler, 
						clearer and comprehensive manner. The subsection was 
						therefore intended to serve as a mechanism whereby the 
						status of those who would suffer diminution could be 
						determined and their identity certified. It was not 
						designed to serve as a measure for assessing the amount 
						of compensation to be paid. This is because section 35 
						of both the old and the new law had been assigned that 
						function. It would be, in my view, preposterous to 
						impute to the legislature ignorance of the existence of 
						section 35 so as to say that it would create another 
						mechanism for assessing the amount of compensation and 
						still retain that section 35 to which that function had 
						already been assigned. To interpret subsection (2) of 
						the NLCD.34 the way being canvassed by the respondents 
						would result in a total truncation of the whole decree 
						because there would be two separate enactments, namely, 
						subsection (2) of section 34 and section 35 both 
						invested with power to assess amount of compensation one 
						for those who suffer diminution as well as those who 
						lose their employment. In my judgment, arrived at by a 
						very careful and meticulous study of the words in the 
						two decrees, NLCD.157 and 342, this would be tantamount 
						to creating artificial and needles duplications on the 
						enactments which could be a recipe for disaster of 
						epoch-making dimension in the task of statutory 
						construction in our courts.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On this vexed question 
						of past services and accumulated benefits being taken 
						into account, I may per force venture some suggested 
						illustrations. In her judgment (vide page 48 of the 
						record of appeal) the learned trial stated as follows: &#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The plaintiffs 
						admitted that they received their end of service 
						benefits under cross-examination, evidence was also led 
						to show that the bargains were done on behalf of the 
						parties by their accredited representatives.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Touching on end of 
						service benefits, the position would be that those who 
						lost their jobs got these benefits paid to them. Those 
						who were retained would not be given these benefits 
						because the period for payment would not be due. It is 
						precisely these benefits yet unpaid but which might have 
						accumulated which the subsection (2) of section 34 of 
						the NLCD.342 has in contemplation. They would have to be 
						taken into account in determining whether a particular 
						worker has suffered any diminution in his terms and 
						conditions of employment and the approach would be to 
						compare these figures to the new ones to be carried 
						forward in the new establishment. Also in my view the 
						phrase &#8220;past services&#8221; does not necessarily refer to the 
						number of years that the worker has served the 
						organisation. It refers to the nature of his past 
						service and the capacities in which he performed those 
						services as well as the remuneration or other advantages 
						in cash or in kind that those services attracted. All 
						these would be assessed vis-a-vis the worker's new terms 
						and conditions to determine whether he has been worse 
						off by the new changes, before he qualifies to be given 
						compensation for the set back.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The grievance which the 
						respondents harboured in their sleeves may not be 
						unreasonable and they cannot be blamed for taking steps 
						to vent their complaint but it seems to me that the 
						target to which these grievances ought to be directed is 
						the representatives who negotiated the amount of 
						severance pay and who in the process deprived them of 
						benefits for the period prior to January, 1991.&nbsp; That 
						matter is not an issue before this court and I should 
						for the moment hold my peace in that regard.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">What the learned trial 
						judge lost sight of in my view was that those workers, 
						if any, who might have suffered any diminution in their 
						terms and conditions of service were equally to be 
						affected by the reduction of the period for which 
						severance pay was to be paid in terms of article 36 of 
						the Collective Agreement Exhibit &#8216;A&#8217;. It would therefore 
						be wrong for the learned trial judge to interpret 
						section 34(2) to give the impression that those who 
						suffered a diminution were exempted from the application 
						of article 36 and that they had an advantage over total 
						job losers. In my view therefore in-as-much as the 
						learned trial judge held that the agreement reached by 
						the negotiation team representing both employer and 
						employees was inconsistent with section 34(2) of the 
						NLCD.342 she erred.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In view of the 
						conclusion that I have come to in respect of the true 
						meaning of section 34(2) of the NLCD.342 which was the 
						basis of the whole action the other grounds of appeal 
						are rendered nugatory. In the result the appeal is 
						allowed and the judgment of the court below is hereby 
						set aside.</span></p>
