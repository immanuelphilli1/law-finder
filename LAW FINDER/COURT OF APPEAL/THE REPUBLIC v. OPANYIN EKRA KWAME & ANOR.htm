												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												TWUMASI, J.A.: </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This appeal raises the vexed 
												question as to the proper 
												approach which a court is 
												required to adopt in determining 
												an issue in a case where the 
												parties have stated their 
												respective versions of the issue 
												by way of affidavits.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the instant case, the 
												appellants were cited for 
												contempt before the High Court, 
												Sekondi for disobeying an order 
												given by the Western Regional 
												House of Chiefs. The order 
												stated that the appellants 
												should within a specified time 
												surrender to the Home of chiefs, 
												the black stool and Bombae drums 
												of Kwesimintim, a town near 
												Takoradi in the Western region. 
												The appellants were cited for 
												contempt at the behest of the 
												respondents for the reason given 
												by the latter that the stool 
												surrendered to the House of 
												Chiefs was not the black stool 
												of Kwesimintim, but a kitchen 
												stool. Also it was contended by 
												the respondents, that the 
												appellants had returned only 
												three out of six bombae drums. 
												The issues that fell for 
												determination by the trial judge 
												were (1) whether the stool 
												surrendered was in fact the 
												black stool of Kwesimintim&nbsp; (2) 
												whether the bombae drums were 
												only three or six in number. The 
												material evidence before the 
												trial judge were affidavits 
												only. The ground of appeal most 
												loudly levelled against the 
												decision of the learned trial 
												judge was that he failed to take 
												oral evidence to determine the 
												issues raised and, consequently, 
												he erred in basing his finding 
												of guilt against the appellants 
												on the basis of the affidavits. 
												To my understanding, Counsel&#8217;s 
												contention was that the 
												proceedings had reached such a 
												pivotal stage where the only 
												compelling option open to the 
												learned trial judge was not a 
												capricious evaluation of bare 
												conflicting affidavits but 
												rather examination in the 
												witness stand of the parties or 
												other persons where the benefit 
												of cross-examination would be 
												available as true indicator to 
												the credibility of witnesses and 
												ultimately serve the ends of 
												justice. He relied on Order 59 
												rule 26 of the High Court (Civil 
												Procedure) Rules 1951 Rev LN 140 
												A, which provides that</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;59 r 26. On the hearing of any 
												motion or summons to which this 
												Order relates the Court or judge 
												may direct any issue of fact in 
												dispute to be tried in the same 
												manner as other issues of fact 
												are tried.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The reaction of Counsel for the 
												respondents to these submissions 
												by his learned friend was that 
												there was no need for the 
												learned trial judge to take 
												evidence on oath because, as he 
												explained in his statement of 
												case, the Registrar of the 
												Regional house of Chiefs had 
												deposed to an affidavit which 
												was neither challenged by the 
												appellants by affidavit nor by 
												word of mouth in Court and, he 
												opined, that this failure to 
												challenge the Registrar&#8217;s 
												averments constituted clear 
												admission which made otiose the 
												taking of evidence on oath 
												inasmuch as the learned trial 
												judge was entitled to determine 
												the issue on the affidavits. The 
												affidavit sworn to by the 
												Registrar read as follows: -</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Affidavit of Crosby Kwesi 
												Davis&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I, Crosby Kwesi Davis of Sekondi 
												make oath and say as follows:-</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1)&nbsp; That I am the Registrar of 
												the Western Region House of 
												Chiefs and the deponent herein.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) That on the 22nd October, 
												1998 the respondents herein 
												deposited an ordinary stool and 
												three drums at the registry of 
												the house.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3) That from my own knowledge 
												and experience as Registrar of 
												the House of Chiefs for nearly 
												thirty years I know a black 
												stool, and that which was sent 
												could not be a black stool.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(4) That on the said date I 
												heard the respondents vow never 
												to surrender that stool and 
												other regalia, because if he 
												surrenders them to Opanyin Kofi 
												Yalley and George Emmanuel 
												Acquah there would be chaos in 
												Kwesimintim.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It was submitted on behalf of 
												the respondents that the thirty 
												years experience acquired by the 
												said Registrar qualified him as 
												credible witness on the identity 
												and character of a black stool 
												as distinguished from an 
												ordinary stool. Furthermore, the 
												fact that his averment that the 
												appellants had vowed never to 
												return the black stool had not 
												been challenged added weight to 
												his credibility. In answer to 
												these submissions, I would in 
												fairness quote paragraphs 34 &amp; 
												35 of the submissions of Counsel 
												for the appellants before I make 
												my comment.&nbsp; The said paragraphs 
												are as follows:- </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;(34) In contempt case, what is 
												the standard of proof? It is 
												trite learning that contempt 
												applications are quasi- criminal 
												and the standard of proof is 
												beyond reasonable doubt.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(35)&nbsp; Faced with such a 
												yardstick, can it be said that 
												the High Court correctly 
												evaluated the evidence before 
												him? All he had before him was 
												affidavit evidence. He chose to 
												believe the story of an 
												administrative officer who has 
												no royal blood that the stool 
												was not a black stool. The 
												administrative officer was not 
												cross-examined. We therefore 
												cannot tell whether he has ever 
												seen the Kwesimintim black stool 
												before, though he said that he 
												knows a black stool. It is 
												common knowledge that black 
												stools are never brought out so 
												one cannot but wonder how this 
												Registrar claims to know black 
												stool. We all know he is not an 
												expert in this field. Only 
												kingmakers are.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												That there must be proof beyond 
												reasonable doubt that a person 
												is guilty of contempt is a 
												principle whose genesis goes 
												back to Lord Denning of blessed 
												memory in his opinion in the 
												case of Re Bramblevale Ltd (1969 
												) 3 All E.R. 1062 where he said:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;A contempt of court is an 
												offence of a criminal nature. A 
												man may be sent to prison for 
												it. It must be satisfactorily 
												proved. To use the time-honoured 
												phrase, it must be proved beyond 
												reasonable doubt. Where there 
												are two equally consistent 
												possibilities open to the court, 
												it is not right to hold that the 
												offence is proved beyond 
												reasonable doubt.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the case of Republic v Bekoe 
												and Others Ex Parte Adjei 
												(1982-83) GLR 91 holding (1) 
												Osei-Hwere J&nbsp; (as he then was) 
												held and I quote:-</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;a civil contempt partook of a 
												criminal charge because 
												conviction might entail 
												imprisonment.&nbsp; Consequently the 
												principle of law was quite clear 
												that where a person was charged 
												with contempt of court, his 
												guilt must be proved with the 
												same strictness as required in a 
												criminal trial ie proof beyond 
												reasonable doubt.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Benin J (as he then was) applied 
												the principle strictly in the 
												case of Gbadamosi v Mohammmadu&nbsp; 
												(1991) 1 GLR 283 and the Court 
												of Appeal in the recent case of 
												the Republic v Georgina Asare Ex 
												Parte Annor-Yeboah &amp; Anor. CA 
												dated 20th May, 2001 unreported 
												this court adopted the principle 
												in a case where the contemnor 
												had denied an allegation that 
												she was among persons who had 
												disrupted a Church Meeting. Her 
												conviction by the High Court on 
												the basis of the affidavits was 
												quashed on the ground that the 
												said contemnor had expressly 
												denied being present or anywhere 
												near the scene of the alleged 
												contempt of Court. The 
												contemnors had been charged for 
												disobedience of an order of the 
												High Court not to go to or near 
												the place of the Church 
												meeting.&nbsp; The Court of Appeal 
												expressed disapproval and 
												condemnation of what it called 
												&#8220;the dangerous misconception by 
												some judges that contempt cases 
												were triable only on affidavits 
												and at times ignoring express 
												denials in affidavits of alleged 
												commission of contempt&#8221;.&nbsp; 
												Against this background I wish 
												to examine a little bit more 
												closely the facts of this case 
												which I consider relevant to the 
												determination of the rightness 
												or wrongness of the decision 
												appealed. First of all, the 
												order made by the western Region 
												House of Chiefs is hereunder 
												reproduced and it is that: -</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;It is hereby ordered that the 
												Petitioner or plaintiff 
												appellant Opanin Ekra Kwame 
												should or must surrender the 
												Kwesimintim Black Stool and the 
												Bombae drums in his possession 
												to the defendant/respondent 
												Opanuyin Kofi Yalley immediately 
												or forthwith.&#8221; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Noticeable in this order is the 
												fact that it does not offer any 
												indication or clue to the actual 
												number of bombae drums and 
												sooner or later the inevitable 
												but avoidable difficulties for 
												this lack of clarity of the 
												order will unfold. Yet another 
												ambiguity in the order is 
												whether the plaintiff had in his 
												possession only some of the 
												bombae drums.&nbsp; The only order 
												which does not admit of any 
												equivocation is that the black 
												stool is supposed to be in the 
												possession of the plaintiff. On 
												the 5th June 1998 the High Court 
												issued a writ of delivery and 
												the appellants were served but 
												they failed to surrender the 
												items and a bench warrant was 
												issued for their apprehension 
												for disobeying an order to 
												appear before the court. Upon 
												service of the bench warrant, 
												the appellants filed a notice of 
												appeal before the Western 
												Regional House of Chiefs 
												challenging its decision on the 
												substantive chieftaincy matter 
												which culminated in the order 
												disobeyed by the appellants. In 
												tune with the practice in our 
												courts, Counsel for the 
												appellants applied for bail for 
												them. </span></p>

												I wish to state in parenthesis

												their pursuant notice for the 
												application for attachment for

												appellants had refused to 
												surrender:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;the black stool and Bombae

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												No mention was specifically made 
												in their relief sought about the 
												number of Bombae drums.&nbsp; 
												However, on the 19th October 
												1998 when the court tried the 
												case, the accusation made 
												against the appellants was that 
												they had defiantly failed to 
												obey the order to surrender the 
												items stated in the order of the 
												Regional House of Chiefs. 
												Counsel for the appellants 
												challenged the competency of the 
												court to entertain the 
												application on the ground that 
												an appeal against the order of 
												the Regional house of Chiefs had 
												been filed which operated as a 
												stay of execution of the order. 
												The court summarily rejected the 
												objection on the ground that the 
												appeal was rather incompetent 
												having been filed out of time. 
												Counsel for the appellants 
												conceded the incompetence of his 
												proposed appeal and the learned 
												trial judge imposed a sentence 
												of imprisonment for a three 
												months term without hard labour. 
												Counsel for the appellants then 
												pleaded for mitigation of 
												sentence and prayed for the 
												option of a fine and for bail so 
												that the appellants would be 
												able to surrender the items 
												demanded by the order of the 
												Regional House of Chiefs and the 
												court obliged and granted bail. 
												On the adjourned date, that is 
												the 23rd October 1998, it came 
												to the notice of the court that 
												the appellants had brought some 
												items. But Counsel for the 
												respondents applied to the court 
												not to rescind the bail because, 
												as he contended, the appellants 
												had brought an ordinary kitchen 
												stool, not the black stool and 
												also only 3 Bombae drums, out of 
												six.&nbsp; This was the first time 
												the court was being told that 
												the Bombae drums were six.&nbsp; The 
												court notes went as follows:-</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;By Respondents: We brought to 
												them what we had in our custody.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												By Applicants: They brought only 
												three drums out of six.&nbsp; The 
												respondents brought a big white 
												stool and it is not the black 
												stool.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												By court: - The respondents will 
												be given two weeks to surrender 
												the black stool and the other 
												three drums. In the meantime the 
												bail granted to the respondents 
												on 21st&nbsp; October, 1998 is hereby 
												rescinded. The matter stands 
												adjourned to Thursday November 
												5th 1995 for further 
												consideration.</span></p>

												Three days later Counsel for the 
												appellants filed a fresh motion 
												for review of the judgment of 
												the court and the vital 
												averments in the supporting 
												affidavit sworn to by Ekra Kwame 
												the first appellant is 
												reproduced hereunder:- </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;(6) That on the 23rd October 
												1998 when we appeared before 
												this court the applicants 
												complained that the stool we 
												surrendered is not the Black 
												Stool and that we have not 
												surrendered all the Bombae 
												drums.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(7)&nbsp; That I explained to the 
												court that the stool I have 
												surrendered to the House of 
												Chiefs is the Kwesimintim Black 
												Stool and that the drums I have 
												surrendered are the stool drums 
												in my possession.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(8)&nbsp; That despite my 
												protestations the court 
												convicted us for contempt on the 
												grounds that the&nbsp; items we have 
												surrendered are not the correct 
												items.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(9)&nbsp; That the court erred by 
												hearing in favour of the story 
												of the applicants who were 
												merely assuming that the Black 
												Stool of Kwasimintim should be 
												black in colour.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(10) That I pray that the court 
												review its order committing us 
												to prison since we have complied 
												fully with the order of the 
												Judicial Committee of the 
												Western Regional House of 
												Chiefs.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(11) Wherefore I swear to this 
												affidavit in support of this 
												application.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What took place before the court 
												at the hearing of this motion 
												was the usual practice of 
												applicant's counsel moving the 
												motion and referring to the 
												affidavit in support with a 
												little elaboration of the 
												applicant's grounds for the 
												motion and the taking of a reply 
												from counsel for the 
												respondents. The learned judge 
												after going through this ritual 
												listened to the affidavit of the 
												Registrar read in court and 
												without any cross-examination 
												wrote his judgment that he was 
												satisfied that the appellants 
												had refused to surrender the 
												Kwesimintim black stool and also 
												kept three of the Bombae drums 
												and released only three.&nbsp; The 
												learned trial judge literally 
												swallowed hook, line and sinker 
												all that was contained in the 
												Registrar&#8217;s affidavit as the 
												gospel truth. Is this procedure 
												right, one may ask?&nbsp; Counsel for 
												the respondents supports the 
												judgment on the ground, among 
												other things, that the affidavit 
												sworn to by the Registrar was 
												not challenged and the learned 
												trial judge was perfectly 
												entitled to base his decision on 
												it without more. It is conceded 
												that evidence which is not 
												challenged need not be further 
												proved by its proponent:&nbsp; (See 
												Armah v Addoquaye (1972) 1 GLR 
												109), the principle is 
												inapposite in the instant case 
												because the issues as to the 
												identity of the Kwasimintim 
												black stool and the number of 
												its Bombae drums have been 
												raised throughout the trial by 
												the protestations of the 
												respondents and I do not think 
												it would be right or fair to 
												them to foist upon them an 
												admission of the issues at the 
												hearing of the motion for review 
												merely because they did not file 
												an affidavit reacting to the 
												Registrar&#8217;s averment.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Aside from this, it must be 
												observed that the hearing of the 
												motion for review was hasty and 
												it did not make justice appear 
												manifestly to have been done.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Registrar&#8217;s affidavit was 
												filed on the 2 November 1998 at 
												9.50 am.&nbsp; Another affidavit 
												sworn to by the respondents was 
												filed at the same time, 2 
												November 1998 at 9.50 am.&nbsp; And 
												the learned trial judge took the 
												motion that same morning and 
												gave the appellants no elbowroom 
												to maneuvre in terms of an 
												opportunity to file any 
												affidavit.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I do not think the learned judge 
												appreciated the compelling 
												necessity on his part to conduct 
												a fair enquiry into the issue 
												which it may considered that 
												arose out of the affidavits and 
												pronouncements by the parties in 
												open court. The learned trial 
												judge should have called 
												competent witnesses with 
												requisite knowledge of the 
												identity of the Kwesination 
												Stool to inspect the one 
												tendered by the appellants and 
												to tell the court whether is the 
												real stool or its imitation.&nbsp; 
												The queen mother, or any of the 
												Kingmakers who enstool occupants 
												of the stool could qualify, not 
												a court Registrar, unless of 
												course he also falls within the 
												list of qualified persons.&nbsp; 
												Again the issue of the number of 
												Bombae drums should have been 
												tried in a proper manner.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Failure by the learned trial 
												judge to perform his judicial 
												function properly rendered the 
												proceedings a nullity and they 
												are so declared.&nbsp; The appeal is 
												allowed and the case is remitted 
												to the court below with a 
												directive that the presiding 
												judge retry it in terms of the 
												procedure laid down in Order 59 
												rule 26 of the High Court (civil 
												Procedure) Rules 1951 Rev LN 140 
												A and give a ruling or judgment 
												thereon.</span></p>
