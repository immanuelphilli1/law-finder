												The Plaintiff/Respondent 
												instituted an action in March 
												1996 in the High Court of 
												Justice Sefwi-Wiawso, against 
												the 1st and 2nd defendants 
												jointly and severally for 
												&quot;damages for trespass unto and 
												unlawful closure of his Beer Bar 
												and Spirits shop commonly known 
												and called &quot;CORNER BAR&quot; in H/NO. 
												C38 at Asaman in 
												Sefwi-Wiawso/Western Region on 
												or about 14th of March 1996.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The plaintiff's case was that he 
												rented the shop from Opanyin 
												Kwaku Matwah now deceased in 
												1991 and that the 1st defendant 
												is the customary successor of 
												the late Kwaku Matwah and upon 
												whom the interest of the late 
												Kwaku Matwah devolved according 
												to customary. The plaintiff said 
												that he was made to remodel the 
												store at the cost of ¢45,870.00 
												and rent was fixed at two 
												hundred and fifty cedis 
												(¢250.00) per month with effect 
												from 1st September, 1985. 
												Tenancy Agreement dated 29th 
												August, 1985 was executed 
												between the parties.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The terms of the said Tenancy 
												Agreement was tendered in 
												evidence as Exhibit A. Clauses 
												3, 4 and 5 of the agreement 
												read:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;(3) That the said amount of 
												Forty-Five Thousand-Eight 
												Hundred and Seventy cedis 
												(¢45,870.00) which the Tenant 
												herein, Mr. Thomas Yaw Chickah 
												has paid to us will lapse for 
												(121/2) twelve and half years 
												starting from 1st September, 
												1985.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(4) That there will be no

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(5) That a renewal of the rent 
												will start soon after the 121/2 
												years are over as stated in the 
												agreement made thereof. Dated at 
												Sefwi Wiawso this 29th day of 
												August 1985.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												According to the plaintiff after 
												succeeding to the property the 
												1st defendant increased the rent 
												to ¢2000.00 per month at first 
												and then to ¢5,000.00 both of 
												which he consented to pay and 
												was paying until April 1995 when 
												the 1st defendant gave him six 
												months notice to quit the 
												premises which plaintiff 
												resisted.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The 1st defendant on the other 
												hand averred that in 1995 he 
												took action before the Rent 
												Officer at Tarkwa for recovery 
												of possession of the store after 
												giving six months notice to quit 
												to the plaintiff. He contended 
												that the Rent Officer ordered 
												recovery of possession which 
												order was referred to the Rent 
												Magistrate who subsequently 
												ordered the ejection of the 
												plaintiff. The 1st defendant 
												therefore counter-claimed for 
												recovery of possession of the 
												store for non-payment of rent 
												and also arrears of rent from 
												April 1995 to date of judgment.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The learned trial judge upheld 
												the case of the plaintiff and 
												gave him judgment. He however 
												dismissed the 1st defendant 
												counter-claim. He awarded the 
												following damages against the 
												1st defendant &quot;I therefore award 
												damages for the plaintiff 
												against the 1st and 2nd 
												defendant jointly and severally 
												and order that plaintiff recover 
												from the 1st and 2nd defendants 
												(jointly and severally) all his 
												daily business losses at the 
												rate of ¢500,000.00 per month 
												from 14 March 1996 to the date 
												of judgment together with 
												interest at an annual rate of 
												30% from 14 March 1996 to the

												learned judge further made the 
												following award.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;I award damages of ¢3million

												In this appeal the 1st 
												defendant/appellant (who will 
												herein after named simply the 
												1st defendant) has filed one 
												original ground of appeal and 
												five additional grounds. The 
												plaintiff/respondent will in 
												this judgment be simply referred 
												to as the plaintiff.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The first ground of appeal is 
												&quot;that the judgment is against 
												the weight of evidence&quot;. </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is noticeable from his 
												pleadings and evidence that the 
												plaintiff rented the premises 
												from the late Opanyin Matwah and 
												Tano Kuma. Opanyin Kwaku Matwah 
												died sometime in 1991 and he was 
												succeeded by the 1st defendant 
												according to custom. According 
												to the plaintiff there was an 
												agreement covering the Rental 
												premises. The agreement was 
												accepted in evidence and marked 
												as Exhibit A. A look at the said 
												agreement indicates that the 1st 
												defendant predecessor Opanyin 
												Kwaku Matwah who thumbprinted 
												the document was illiterate and 
												the agreement was written in 
												English. The action was 
												instituted on the 21st March 
												1996 obviously after the death 
												of Opanyin Kwaku Matwah.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In his evidence the plaintiff 
												recounted that in the course of 
												the dispute between him and the 
												1st defendant they appeared 
												before the Rent Control Officer 
												at Tarkwa. The plaintiff gave 
												the following evidence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;When I went to Tarkwa I was 
												asked why I had refused to quit 
												1st defendant's premises. I told 
												the officer that there was an 
												agreement covering my Rental 
												occupancy. I showed the 
												agreement to the Rent Control 
												Officer. He asked the 1st 
												defendant why he was evicting me 
												from the premises in the light 
												of agreement. 1st defendant 
												denied the existence of such an 
												agreement so the officer made a 
												Photostat copy for the 1st 
												defendant and told him he had no 
												right to evict me from the 
												premises.&quot; (The emphasis is 
												mine). It is evident from 
												Exhibit A that the agreement 
												covering the Rental premises 
												between the plaintiff and the 
												1st defendant's predecessor 
												Opanyin Kwaku Matwah that the 
												latter was illiterate and 
												therefore thumbprinted and made 
												his mark on the document. There 
												is nothing to establish that the 
												person who wrote the document 
												for such an illiterate read or 
												caused to be read over and 
												explained the contents of the 
												document in terms of section 4 
												of illiterate protection 
												ordinance CAP 262 (1951) to 
												Opanyin Kwaku Matwah.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Again it has been held by the 
												courts, that the burden is 
												always on the party relying on 
												the document to prove that it 
												was read over and if necessary 
												interpreted to the illiterate 
												person and that it was 
												understood by him.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the instant case there is 
												evidence that the 1st defendant 
												denied the existence of any 
												tenancy agreement and therefore 
												the plaintiff who was relying on 
												it (Exhibit A) was obligated 
												before the document was accepted 
												by the court to prove that 
												Exhibit A was read over and 
												interpreted to the 1st 
												defendant's illiterate uncle 
												before the latter thumbprinted 
												it. No such evidence was led by 
												the plaintiff. In WAYA VRS 
												BYROUTHY (1958) 3 W.A.C.R. 413. 
												It was held that &quot;where an 
												illiterate executes a document 
												any other party to the document 
												who relies upon it must prove 
												that it was read over and if 
												necessary interpreted to the 
												illiterate.&quot; This decision was 
												approved and echoed in the 
												Supreme court's case of BOAKYEM 
												AND OTHERS VRS ANSAH (1963) 2 
												G.L.R. 223. The court further 
												held that where on illiterate 
												attests to the execution of a 
												document by making his mark on 
												it, there is no presumption that 
												he has knowledge of the contents 
												of the document.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the light of the principles 
												alluded to above, I hold that 
												since the 1st defendant denied 
												the existence of the tenancy 
												agreement allegedly made by his 
												predecessor the plaintiff ought 
												to have led evidence to prove 
												that the content of the document 
												were read and explained to him 
												before his illiterate uncle 
												thumbprinted it. As he failed to 
												do so, I further hold that the 
												tenancy Agreement Exhibit A 
												never bound the 1st defendant's 
												predecessor and is therefore of 
												no effect.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Now having declared the tenancy 
												Agreement - Exhibit A as being 
												of no effect the law that should 
												govern the relationship between 
												the plaintiff and the 1st 
												defendant is the Rent Act, 1963 
												(Act 220).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As already said the 1st 
												defendant counter-claimed for 
												recovery of possession of the 
												store for non-payment of rent, 
												also for arrears of rent from 
												April 1995 to date of judgment.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												At page 51 of this judgment the 
												learned judge held as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Evidence before the court shows 
												that the plaintiff was in 
												occupation of the premises now 
												in dispute by virtue of the 
												terms in Exhibit A ie the 
												TENANCY AGREEMENT.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There is no provision for rent 
												review until after 121/2 years. 
												Therefore 1st defendant had no 
												right to demand any increase in 
												rent and that the increase from 
												¢250.00 to ¢2,000.00 at the 
												instance of the 1st Defendant 
												was unlawful and - null and 
												void. Similarly the 1st 
												defendant had not right to ask 
												the Rent Officer to assess the 
												rent of the premises for by 
												virtue of the terms of Exhibit A 
												there was no provision for the 
												review of the rent and any 
												assessment effected by the 2nd 
												defendant at the request of the 
												1st defendant is null and void 
												abinitio and of no effect.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As already decided in this 
												judgment the Tenancy Agreement 
												Exhibit A the bases of the 
												plaintiff's claim is 
												unenforceable and of no effect. 
												The trial judge erred in relying 
												on it to give judgment in favour 
												of the plaintiff. Even if I am 
												wrong in declaring that Exhibit 
												A as of no effect. It is my 
												judgment that the learned 
												judge's view that because the 
												Tenancy Agreement - Exhibit A 
												has no provision for rent review 
												for 121/2 years the parties 
												could not review the rent was 
												erroneous. Indeed it's trite law 
												that parties to an agreement can 
												mutually amend, vary or revoke 
												the said agreement even if there 
												is no such provision in the 
												Agreement. See PLYMOUTH 
												CORPORATION VRS HARVEY (1971) 1 
												WLR 549 and NASH VRS. ARMSTRONG 
												(1861) 10 CB (NS) 259.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There is evidence on record that 
												the rent increases were mutually 
												agreed to by the parties and 
												plaintiff consented to paying 
												same until he stopped paying in 
												April 1995 after he was served 
												with the notice to quit. 
												Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the 
												plaintiff's reply and Defence to 
												the counter-claim read as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;2. Save that the 1st defendant 
												increased the rent to ¢2,000.00 
												per month by consent before the 
												increase to ¢5000 on the basis 
												that 250.00 per month was meager 
												the plaintiff denies paragraph 7 
												and 8 of the 1st defendant's 
												statement of Defence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3. The plaintiff repeats 
												paragraph 2 above and says that 
												he agreed to the increase of 
												¢2,000 per month after the death 
												of 1st defendant predecessor 
												Opanyin Kwaku Matwah on 
												humanitarian grounds because the 
												1st defendant removed the old 
												roof and re-roofed the 
												store-room and other parts of 
												the premises and which said 
												re-roofing was made at a 
												considerable cost.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As stated 1st defendant's 
												counter-claim was for recovery 
												of possession for NON PAYMENT of 
												rent from April 1995 and for the 
												said rent arrears.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Section 17 (1) (a) of the Rent 
												Act (Act 220) provides,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;17 (1) Subject to the 
												provisions of sub section (2) of 
												section 25 and of section 28, no 
												order against a tenant for the 
												recovery of the possession of, 
												or for the ejectment from, any 
												premises shall be made or given 
												by the appropriate Rent 
												Magistrate or any other Judge of 
												a Court of competent 
												jurisdiction in accordance with 
												the provisions of any other 
												enactment for the time being in 
												force, except in any of the 
												following circumstances:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) Where any rent lawfully due

												..........................................................&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is unquestionable that under 
												section 17 (1) (a) of Act 220 
												(supra) the 1st defendant claim 
												was legitimate and lawfully. Now 
												since the uncontroverted 
												evidence established that the 
												plaintiff paid the agreed rent 
												till April 1995 when he stopped, 
												the 1st defendant was entitled 
												to judgment on his 
												counter-claim. I think the 
												learned judge misconstrued and 
												misdirected himself on the 
												nature of the 1st defendant 
												counter-claim which misdirection 
												led him to dismiss the said 
												counter-claim.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The above finding disposes of 
												grounds (a) and (b) of the 
												grounds of appeal. It is my view 
												that the rest of the grounds 
												involve the same question of law 
												and I will therefore deal with 
												them together.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In his judgment the learned 
												judge upheld the case for the 
												plaintiff and awarded the 
												following damages.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;On the question of damages the 
												court is of the opinion that 
												there is evidence from both the 
												plaintiff and the 1st defendant 
												that the store was being used 
												for commercial purposes by the 
												plaintiff. He was selling 
												assorted drinks therein and that 
												the Beer Bar was being well 
												patronised. The plaintiff was 
												making reasonable profits 
												¢30,000.00 to ¢100,000.00 per 
												day. The store has also been 
												locked up since 14th March 1996.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Plaintiff's items such as 
												glasses, pieces of furniture, 
												frigidaire (Deep Freezer), 
												ceiling fun, tables etc have all 
												been locked up (see Exhibit D) 
												the inventory dated 14th March 
												1996. I therefore award damages 
												for the plaintiff against the 
												1st and 2nd defendants jointly 
												and severally and order that 
												plaintiff recover from the 1st 
												and 2nd defendants (jointly and 
												severally) all his daily 
												business losses at the rate of 
												¢500,000.00 per month from 14th 
												March 1996 to the date of 
												judgment together with interest 
												at annual rate of interest of 
												30% from 14th March 1996 to the 
												date of final payment.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The plaintiff's claim is for 
												general damages for trespass to 
												his store. In attempting to 
												prove trespass against 1st and 
												2nd defendants the plaintiff 
												called Francis KPORWONU a Sgt of 
												the Ghana Police Force then 
												stationed at Sefwi-Wiawso. He 
												gave evidence as PW 1. His 
												testimony was that sometime in 
												March 1996 ie 8th March to be 
												precise, a Rent officer from 
												Tarkwa accompanied by the 1st 
												defendant came with a letter of 
												authority dated 8th March 1996 
												to eject the plaintiff from a 
												Store-room at house No. C 38, 
												Sefwi-Wiawso. The letter was 
												referred to him by his District 
												Commander. The said letter was 
												tendered and marked as Exhibit 
												C. PW 1's evidence was that he 
												went to the Store with the 1st 
												defendant the Rent Officer (the 
												2nd defendant) and opened the 
												store. When they got to the 
												store the plaintiff was present 
												but when he was invited to 
												witness the inventory which was 
												to be taken, he refused the 
												invitation and went away. PW1, 
												said the Rent Officer and the 
												1st defendant then took an 
												inventory of the items in the 
												store and locked the store. The 
												inventory document - Exhibit D 
												was signed by them and he kept a 
												copy. He said that after taking 
												the inventory the store was 
												locked and the Rent Officer kept 
												the key.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The essence of the evidence of 
												PW 1 was that he acted with the 
												authority of his District 
												Commander after the 1st and 2nd 
												defendants have shown them 
												letter of authority. The 
												plaintiff was called to witness 
												the taking of the inventory but 
												he refused to do so. Under the 
												circumstances, what was the 
												basis for the trespass?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Again I Mr. Alfred Osei Mensah 
												(PW 2) a District Registrar in 
												charge of the Tarkwa Community 
												Tribunal gave the following 
												evidence under 
												cross-examination.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Q: On the face for it, Exhibit 
												C is an authority to eject the 
												Tenant and was issued by the 
												Chairman of the Tarkwa Community 
												Tribunal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A: Yes.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Q: It was directed at the Rent 
												Officer at Tarkwa to carry out 
												the order.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A: Yes.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Q: By the said authority, the 
												Rent Officer was to eject from 
												House No. C 38, Sefwi-Wiawso, 
												Nana Thomas Chika (the plaintiff 
												who is also called Nana Yaw 
												Nsowah).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A: Yes.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Q: He (Chika) was eventually to 
												hand over the keys to one 
												Okyeame Kobiri (the 1st 
												defendant).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A: Yes.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Q: The document you are holding 
												on the face of it is a valid 
												document executed by the 
												Chairman of the Tribunal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A: On the face of it, it is a 
												valid document.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Continuing the cross-examination 
												the following also transpired.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Q: On the face of Exhibit C the 
												Rent Officer could act on the 
												terms of the Order without 
												necessary knowing whether they 
												were valid or invalid.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A: yes.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A look at Exhibit C evinces the 
												fact that it was signed by the 
												Chairman of the Community 
												Tribunal. There was no attempt 
												by the plaintiff to prove that 
												the signature of the Chairman on 
												Exhibit C was forged or not 
												genuine. I must say that in the 
												light of the evidence of the 
												plaintiff's own witnesses it is 
												difficult to find the basis for 
												the justification of award of 
												damages for trespass. I hold 
												that since the 1st and 2nd 
												defendants committed no trespass 
												there was no proof that Exhibit 
												C on which the police acted to 
												lock the store was forged.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In his own evidence-in-chief the 
												plaintiff also conceded that 
												&quot;presently my assorted drinks, 
												glasses etc have since been 
												removed from the Store upon 
												Orders of the Court made on 10th 
												December, 1996.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Under cross-examination the 
												plaintiff also gave the 
												following testimony.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Q: At a point in the course of 
												this matter you applied to this 
												court to have your drinks 
												released to you.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A: Yes, I did.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Q: Your items were released to 
												you.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A: Those I requested were 
												released to me leaving others in 
												the Store.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is deducible from the 
												evidence on record that 
												throughout the trial the 
												plaintiff made no attempt to 
												prove any damage for trespass at 
												all apart from repeating his 
												averment in the statement of 
												claim, that he was earning on 
												average about ¢80,000.00 to 
												¢100,000.00 per day from the 
												Store which was denied by the 
												1st defendant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There is no proof on record to 
												justify the award of ¢500,000.00 
												per month as the plaintiff 
												business losses made by the 
												trial judge. It is my judgment 
												that the award of ¢500,000.00 
												per month as the plaintiff's 
												losses from the 14th March 1996 
												to the date for judgment, 
												together with interest of 30% 
												from 14th March, 1996 to the 
												date of final payment has no 
												legal bases. The learned trial 
												judge failed to provide any 
												legal justification whatsoever 
												for the award.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												For the matters discussed above, 
												I will set aside the judgment of 
												the High Court and give judgment 
												for the 1st defendant on his 
												counter-claim. The appeal is 
												accordingly allowed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Having come to the above 
												decision I do not think any 
												useful purpose will be served by 
												my dealing with the rest of the 
												grounds of appeal filed by the 
												1st defendant?</span></p>
