						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;1. The plaintiffs are

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2. The defendants are a

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3. The plaintiffs have

						defendants.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">4. The defendants 
						issued Social Security Bank cheque No. 78 dated 11th 
						December 1997 for the sum of ¢98,988,402.26 to defray 
						the cost of plaintiffs' products but was however

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">5. The defendants on 
						1st January 1998 issued three Social Security Bank

						¢50,000,000.00, ¢60,000,000.00 and ¢20,000,000.00

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">6. Plaintiffs claim 
						against the defendants as per the writ of summons.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After 
						defendants/appellants had entered appearance and before 
						they filed a Statement of Defence the 
						plaintiff's/respondents brought an application for 
						Summary Judgment under Order 14 rule 1. The content of 
						the accompanying affidavit was a virtual reproduction of 
						the Statement of Claim quoted above. However, before the 
						hearing date of the Summons for Judgment the appellants 
						filed their Statement of Defence and Counterclaim on 
						16th December 1998. I think a reproduction of only 
						paragraphs 3 and 4 of the defendants/appellants rather 
						long pleading would do for our purposes in this 
						judgment. They are as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;3. The defendant 
						refers to paragraph 4 and 5 of the Statement of Claim 
						and says that the cheques were not dishonoured instead 
						they were countermanded by the defendant because the 
						plaintiff had not sat down with defendant to agree on 
						the actual amount owed by defendant yet the plaintiffs 
						persistently demanded that cheques should be issued out 
						to them on account to reduce the amount they in their 
						own contemplation, claimed the defendant owed them even 
						though the defendant insisted that until and unless the 
						two parties had entered into account he did not accept 
						their figure. Defendant therefore did not expect the 
						plaintiffs to present the cheques until they entered 
						into accounts whereas the plaintiff contended that they 
						wanted the balances of customers to be reduced at the 
						end of the year and these discrepancies made the 
						defendant stop the cheques.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Defendant 
						says that the Depot contract appointment between the 
						plaintiff and defendant which plaintiff unilaterally 
						abrogated without notice to the defendant has caused 
						great loss to the defendant and also resulting in a 
						total collapse of his business. Defendant says that 
						until and unless plaintiff enters into account with 
						defendant, which covers, inter alia, returned cheques 
						Nos. 1296400 of 4/11/98, 229528 of 21/7/98, 100 plastics 
						on invoice No, K010164 of 29/4/97, promotion stock 
						borrowed, expired ale returned, refund of handling 
						charges, empties not credited, fulls and empties sent to 
						Kumasi. Plalntiff cannot succeed in the present action, 
						which borders on accounts.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Summons for 
						Judgment came on for hearing on 18th January 1999. The 
						defendants/appellants and their counsel were absent. The 
						Court gave judgment in favour of the 
						plaintiffs/respondents as can be seen in the record of 
						proceedings on that day which is reproduced below as 
						follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Mr. S. Okudzeto for 
						the plaintiff/applicant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel&#8217;s attention is 
						drawn to an arithmetical error in paragraph 5 of the 
						Statement of Claim, which he concedes to. Says then to 
						be enabled to rectify the error.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">By Court: Let the 
						plaintiff be enabled to have the said error contained in 
						paragraph 5 be corrected by substituting ¢64 million for 
						¢60 million. (See Order 28 rule 12).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel refers to the 
						application under Order 14 based on bills of exchange 
						ie. that the defendant issued cheques, which upon 
						presentation were dishonoured. Says that the defendants 
						in their defence which was filed after the application 
						herein have admitted issuing the cheques but have not 
						raised any of the known defence in such a situation as 
						such consideration. This being the case prays that the 
						judgment sought be granted.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">By Court: I have 
						examined the instant application and referred to the 
						defence on the file filed after the application and 
						listened to counsel on behalf of plaintiff/applicant and 
						I am satisfied that the matters raised in the defence do 
						not afford the defendant any defence to the action 
						herein, which is based on dishonoured bills of exchange 
						issued by the defendant in favour of the plaintiff for 
						goods purchased.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the circumstances I 
						think that this is an application, which is within the 
						contemplation of Order 14 of the Rules as amended by 
						L.I. 1129 and consequently the application being good I 
						proceed to enter summary judgement against the defendant 
						in the sum of ¢233,988,402.26 effective from 1/12/99 
						with interest at the rate of 37sic per annum until the 
						amount herein adjudged due to the plaintiff is finally 
						paid up. I also allow costs in favour of the plaintiff 
						in the sum of ¢20 million. In my opinion although there 
						is a counterclaim on the file by the defendant against 
						the plaintiff, it is not a bona fide claim and as such I 
						refuse to exercise my discretion in the defendants 
						favour by grant of stay of execution under rule 5(2) of 
						Order 14 by virtue of the pendency of the said 
						counterclaim.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After the Summary 
						Judgment the first step taken by the 
						defendants/appellants was to file a motion under Order 
						14 rule 11 to set aside the Summary Judgment dated 18th 
						January 1999. That application was heard on 15th April 
						1999. It was dismissed. The High Court in its ruling 
						made the following observation at pages 44 and 45 of the 
						record of appeal:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Besides at the hearing 
						of the summary judgment which it is sought by this 
						application to set aside, there was on the file a 
						defence filed by the defendant on 16.12.96 which the 
						court took into account. It need be said that the rule 
						provides that 'the defendant may show cause against the 
						application by affidavit or otherwise to the 
						satisfaction of the court. (See Order 14 rule 3(1) as 
						amended by L.I. 1129). Clearly therefore a defence which 
						is on the file is a process which may entitle the 
						defendant applicant obtain leave or have the application 
						dismissed. It would thus appear that the 
						defendant/applicant cannot be heard saying that not 
						having filed affidavit in opposition to the application 
						having been served with the same, this alone should be a 
						ground for the judgment regularly obtained be set aside. 
						I think that after the applicant had refused to take 
						advantage of the opportunity offered him by service of 
						the application to be heard, he should not in this forum 
						try to re-open issues which when the matter came up 
						before the judge in open Court were not before him. I 
						think the applicant is wholly to blame for the situation 
						in which it now finds itself. In fact In arguing the 
						application counsel in my view should have limited 
						himself to the processes which he had then filed which 
						in this cause is limited to the defence dated 12.12.98. 
						It being so, in my view having considered the said 
						defence at the hearing of 18.1.99 in the delivery 
						resulting in the entry of summary judgment, I do not 
						think it is right for the applicant who failed to put 
						before this Court what he now alleges in order that the 
						Court may set aside a regularly obtained judgment. That 
						aside, examining the new materials, I am of the opinion 
						that they do not afford to the defendant a defence to an 
						action based on cheques, which were dishonoured. The 
						issue in my thinking are contained in the counterclaim 
						and appear to relate to an agreement outside the supply 
						of drinks to it by the plaintiff and if it so desires it 
						may proceed with the counterclaim. The result is that I 
						am unable to set aside the judgment dated 18.1.99 in the 
						instant action...&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this appeal, which 
						is against both the judgment dated 18th January 1999 and 
						the ruling of the court dated 15th April 1999, the 
						Grounds of Appeal are as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(i) The learned judge 
						failed to exercise his discretion judicially by refusing 
						to grant stay of execution of the summary judgment 
						pending the determination of the counterclaim under rule 
						5(2) of L.I. 1129.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(ii) The learned judge 
						erred in law in entering summary judgment in favour of 
						the respondents in view of the Statement of Defence and 
						the Counterclaim filed on 16/12/98, which disclosed 
						several triable issues including the need of the parties 
						to enter into accounts or reconcile their accounts and 
						set off against either party.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(iii) The learned judge 
						erred in law by holding that the defendant/appellant 
						cannot come under Order 14, rule 11 of L.I. 1129 to 
						apply to set aside the summary judgment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I would like to deal 
						mainly with ground (ii) of the grounds of appeal which 
						is &quot;The learned judge erred in law in entering summary 
						Judgment in favour of the respondents in view of the 
						Statement of Defence and the Counterclaim filed on 
						16/12/98, which disclosed several triable issues 
						Including the need of the parties to enter into accounts 
						or reconcile their accounts and set off against either 
						party&#8221;. I hope that would take good care of the other 
						two grounds of appeal, namely grounds (i) and (iii). I 
						entirely agree with the exposition of the law by the 
						learned judge on the operation of Order 14 and the 
						relevant rules in application for Summary Judgment. It 
						is obvious that in its ruling of 15th April 1999 the 
						Court gave the impression that it considered at least 
						the defence filed by the appellants two days before 
						hearing of the Summons for Summary Judgment came on. I 
						have taken sometime to examine the entire judgment of 
						the High Court quoted above again and again and I find 
						no reference in it to the content of the Statement of 
						Defence and Counterclaim filed sic the appellants, to 
						demonstrate the consideration the court gave to it. All 
						that was said of the pleading of the appellants in the 
						court&#8217;s ruling was 'I have examined the instant 
						application and referred to the defence on the file 
						filed after the application and listened to counsel on 
						behalf of plaintiff/applicant and I am satisfied that 
						the matters raised in the defence do not afford the 
						defendant any defence to the action herein, which is 
						based on dishonoured bills of exchange issued by the 
						defendant in favour of the plaintiff for goods 
						purchased&quot; The Court&#8217;s judgment did not say anything 
						about the contention of the appellants in their pleading 
						that the cheques, which formed a substantial basis of 
						the respondents claim were not 'dishonoured cheques&#8217; but 
						'countermanded cheques.' I am quite sure that if the 
						Court had adverted its attention to the issue raised in 
						the appellants' pleading about 'dishonoured' and 
						'countermanded' cheques, it would have come to the 
						conclusion that the matters raised afforded the 
						appellants defence to the respondents&#8217; action. In fact 
						the only direct comment respecting the content of the 
						appellants&#8217; pleading was in relation to the 
						Counterclaim. It reads: &quot;In my opinion although there is 
						a counterclaim on the file by the defendant against the 
						plaintiff, it is not a bona fide claim and as such I 
						refuse to exercise my discretion in the defendant&#8217;s 
						favour by grant of stay of execution under rule 5(2) of 
						Order 14 by virtue of the pendency of the said 
						counterclaim.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In effect contrary to 
						the allusion in the Court's ruling of 15th April 1999 
						that the appellant&#8217;s Statement of Defence was taken into 
						account when the Court gave its judgment the appellants' 
						pleading which in my view evidenced a competent defence 
						was completely ignored by the Court. It is worthy of 
						note that the issue of 'dishonoured cheques', which 
						formed the basis of the court's judgment, was the 
						subject of challenge in the appellants' pleading quoted 
						above. As a reminder I repeat paragraph 3 of the 
						appellants Statement of Defence and Counterclaim quoted 
						above namely: &quot;3. The defendant refers to paragraphs 4 
						and 5 of the Statement of Claim and says that the 
						cheques were not dishonoured instead they were 
						countermanded by the defendant because the plaintiff had 
						not sat down with defendant to agree on the actual 
						amount owed by defendant yet the plaintiffs persistently 
						demanded that cheques should be issued out to them on 
						account to reduce the amount they in their own 
						contemplation, claimed the defendant owed them even 
						though the defendant insisted that until and unless the 
						two parties had entered into account he did not accept 
						their figure. Defendant therefore did not expect the 
						plaintiffs to present the cheques until they entered 
						into accounts whereas the plaintiff contended that they 
						wanted the balances of customers to be reduced at the 
						end of the year and these discrepancies made the 
						defendant stop the cheques&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The substance of 
						paragraph 3 of the appellants&#8217; pleading quoted above is 
						that the cheques that formed the basis of the 
						respondents claim against the appellants were not 'dishonoured&#8217; 
						but &#8216;countermanded'. There is a world of difference 
						between the two expressions. 'Dishonoured cheque' 
						connotes refusal by the bank to make payment in respect 
						of a cheque usually on account of lack of credit on the 
						part of the drawer or for some other reason. In the case 
						of 'Countermanded cheque' on the other hand, the mandate 
						given to the drawee bank is cancelled and in effect 
						payment by the bank upon presentation is stopped. When 
						the issue of the &#8216;dishonoured cheques&#8217; and 
						&#8216;countermanded cheques&#8217; presented itself by the pleading 
						of the defendants filed after the Summons for Judgment 
						had been filed it is understandable that the respondents 
						who were applicants in that application for summary 
						judgment did not have the opportunity adduce further 
						affidavit evidence that the cheques were dishonoured and 
						not countermanded. However they had their chance when 
						they filed an affidavit in opposition to the appellants&#8217; 
						application to set aside the judgment of the Court dated 
						15th January 1999. The issue of 'dishonoured cheques' 
						and 'countermanded cheques' could have been resolved by 
						production of the cheques that were presented at the 
						bank.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">For the reasons given 
						in this judgment the appeal is allowed and both the 
						judgment of 18th January 1999 and the Court&#8217;s ruling 
						dated 15th April 1999 are set aside. The case before the 
						High Court is to take its normal course.</span></p>
