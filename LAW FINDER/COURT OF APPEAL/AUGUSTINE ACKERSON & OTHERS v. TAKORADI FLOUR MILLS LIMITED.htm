						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is appeal against

						January 1992. The plaintiffs has sued the defendant for</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">a.&nbsp; &quot;Declaration that 
						the plaintiffs&#8217; dismissal from the defendant's 
						employment is unlawful and contrary to natural justice, 
						equity and good conscience.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">b.&nbsp;&nbsp; Payment of all 
						entitlements due the plaintiffs.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">c.&nbsp;&nbsp; Damages for 
						wrongful dismissal.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial judge, after 
						taking evidence from both sides, entered judgment for 
						the plaintiffs upon their claims and proceeded to make 
						certain awards for them. The defendant was aggrieved by 
						these and brought an appeal against them. I must observe 
						that the appeal was struck out for non-compliance with 
						the requirements of Rule 20 (1) of C.I. 19 in pursuance 
						of Rule 20(2) of the Court of Appeal Rules, 1997 C.I. 
						19. I am unaware of any effort to relist the defendant&#8217;s 
						appeal or any order relisting it.&nbsp; The position as I 
						understand it then is that there is no appeal against 
						the judgment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">However, the plaintiffs 
						also brought a cross-appeal against that part of the 
						judgment that dealt with the dismissal on the grounds 
						that the management acted as judges in their own cause 
						and also the award of damages. The grounds were that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">a.&nbsp; &#8220;The awards of 
						damages made were too low, having regard to the numerous 
						salary increases and the difficulty in securing new 
						employment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">b.&nbsp;&nbsp; The computation of 
						the awards made by the trial judge was wrong.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">c.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional grounds 
						shall be filed when the record of proceedings is 
						received&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I am unaware of any 
						additional issues having been filed as yet. Therefore, 
						this cross-appeal will be limited to only these two 
						grounds. Before I resolve the issues raised I would like 
						to state the facts of this case. It was that the 
						Defendant Company formerly employed the plaintiffs in 
						&#8216;various capacities&#8217;. In February 1990, they were 
						dismissed from their employment. It was the case of the 
						plaintiffs that at the time of their dismissal they were 
						receiving a basic salary of ¢25,488.00, ¢15,820.00 and 
						¢20,779.00 respectively, every month. Each of them also 
						received a basic allowance, free meal and medical 
						treatment.&nbsp; After their dismissals the other workers 
						were made to enjoy salary increments.&nbsp; They were 
						excluded from enjoying the same facilities. In a letter 
						sent later on to the affected plaintiffs it was 
						explained to them that the basis of their dismissals was 
						that they had collected some I.O.Us from the company.&nbsp; 
						The plaintiffs said that they explained their conduct 
						and even refunded all sums of monies they collected, but 
						they were nevertheless dismissed summarily. Other 
						workers who had similarly taken I.O.Us were not 
						dismissed even though they had not refunded what they 
						took from the company. The plaintiffs contended that 
						their dismissals were wrongful and amounted to 
						victimization. For a remedy they took this action 
						against the defendant for the reliefs stated above.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendant did not 
						deny dismissing the plaintiffs from their employment. 
						They explained that this was because the plaintiffs 
						admitted collecting I.O.Us without any authority, which 
						act they said amounted to dishonesty.&nbsp; The reason was 
						that a new management had been instituted in the 
						Defendant Company between June 1989 and January 1990 
						charged with the sole responsibility of disbursing 
						funds. In view of this arrangement a cashier had no 
						authority to expend any money without approval of either 
						the Resident Director or Management. For not passing 
						through the procedure, the dismissals of the plaintiffs 
						were said to be in accordance with the collective 
						agreement and they were not therefore entitled to their 
						claims.&nbsp; As stated already, the trial judge found favour 
						with the case of the plaintiffs more than with that of 
						the defendant and entered the judgment under appeal in 
						favour of the plaintiffs.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This appeal raises some 
						interesting point of procedure that must be settled at 
						this stage. It is that as I have said already, the 
						Defendant Company (which I henceforth refer to simply as 
						the respondent) had their appeal struck out for reasons 
						already given. This means what is left is the 
						plaintiffs' cross-appeal. ( I now refer to them simply 
						as the cross-appellants).&nbsp; The issue is, in resolving 
						the cross-appeal should the court proceed with only the 
						matters therein raised or should it determine the 
						rightness or otherwise of the judgment as a whole.&nbsp; The 
						danger in looking at how right the judgment was is that 
						it may give the appellant, whose appeal has been struck 
						out by operation of law, another chance to argue the 
						appeal through the backdoor. On the other hand too is 
						the point that before a court of justice and law 
						determines the cross-appeal on its merits it must 
						satisfy itself that the judgment itself is in the first 
						place right both on the law and the facts upon which it 
						is based.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It must be recognized 
						that the court has the power under Order 32 of C.I. 19 
						to give judgment and make an order or orders.&nbsp; Under 
						rule (2) of this order, &#8220; these powers may be exercised 
						notwithstanding that the appellant may have asked that 
						part only of a decision be reversed or varied, and may 
						also be exercised in favour of all or any of the 
						respondents or parties, although the respondents or 
						parties may not have appealed from or complained of the 
						decision&#8221;. The point being made is that this court has 
						the power to give that kind of judgment that it thinks 
						fit provided the evidence on record supports it.&nbsp; This 
						is so even where there is no appeal against the 
						decision. More directly in connection with this case may 
						it be stated that where the appeal itself has been 
						struck out for non-compliance with the rules, that would 
						ordinarily have ended the proceedings. The party who 
						lost the suit in the court below would be required to 
						obtain an order re-instating the appeal.&nbsp; If he did not 
						do that he would lose the chance of ventilating any 
						grievance or grievances against the judgment.&nbsp; The 
						position is different where the party who won the action 
						in the court below decides to cross-appeal against the 
						judgment.&nbsp; An example is this case where the plaintiffs 
						decided to complain against the quantum of damages 
						awarded in their favour only.&nbsp; It is perfectly within 
						their rights to ask for an upward adjustment of the 
						awards for reasons made clear to the court. That is the 
						essence of this cross-appeal.&nbsp; When the cross-appeal 
						comes on for hearing, it is open to the respondent to 
						satisfy this court why it should not be allowed.&nbsp; In 
						doing this he is entitled to posit before the court that 
						the judgment was after all not sound in law or on the 
						facts or on any other grounds.&nbsp; Therefore it is by 
						virtue of the cross-appeal that the defendant in this 
						case got the chance to challenge the soundness of the 
						judgment after their appeal had been struck out for 
						non-compliance with the rules and was no longer 
						pending.&nbsp; A note of caution must be sounded here, 
						namely, that the appellate court should be careful in 
						dealing with a case in similar circumstances.&nbsp; The 
						appellate court should be mindful of the grounds of the 
						cross-appeal.&nbsp; So that where they do not impinge on the 
						validity of the judgment, the respondent to the 
						cross-appeal does not import that into the appeal 
						through the &#8216;backdoor&#8217;. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I now turn to the 
						grounds of the cross-appeal I think I have set them out 
						already.&nbsp; In support of that ground it was submitted 
						that &#8220;having regard to the period of their dismissal, 
						which was February 1990, and considering the fact that 
						as at 28th November 1991, when the plaintiffs gave 
						evidence, the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs were unemployed 
						&#8230;(they) described themselves as unemployed, and it was 
						wrong for the trial judge to state that &#8220;It would have 
						taken each plaintiff about 5 months to look for 
						alternative job&#8221;.&nbsp; In fact 21 months after their 
						dismissals, some of the plaintiff, had not found any 
						other work.&nbsp; The general trend on the labor front in the 
						1990s was that it was very difficult to get employment.&nbsp; 
						Counsel invited this court to take judicial notice of 
						this fact.&nbsp; In the case of the third plaintiff, though 
						he secured a new employment, it was only as an 
						administrative officer whereas he was an accountant by 
						profession.&nbsp; The plaintiffs therefore complained that it 
						was wrong for the trial judge to say that five months 
						was adequate for each of them to find another work.&nbsp; I 
						wish to express my disagreement with that submission by 
						counsel for the cross-appellants.&nbsp; When the trial judge 
						said that the appellants could secure employment within 
						5 months what he meant was that was a reasonable time 
						within which they could do so.&nbsp; He could not have meant 
						that within the period they would at all cost get new 
						employment so that if they did not, then he was wrong.&nbsp; 
						What must be borne in mind is that in cases of this 
						nature, as in all torts, the principle is that the 
						plaintiff is under a duty to mitigate his loss.&nbsp; In fact 
						when a similar situation arose in Ghana National Trading 
						Corporation v. Baiden [1991] 1GLR 567 SC, Francois JSC 
						said at page 576 that the onus lay on the plaintiff 
						therein to show the efforts he made to mitigate his 
						losses. Those efforts could include the production of 
						copies of letters he wrote to seek some gainful 
						employment but were turned down, and generally his 
						personal efforts to lift himself from an economic 
						morass. I think that is&nbsp; the principle to apply in this 
						case. It was beyond dispute that the plaintiffs were 
						dismissed in February 1989. They took their action on 
						2nd May 1990 and judgment was delivered on 13th February 
						1992, a period of about 21 months. The plaintiffs, it 
						was submitted, gave evidence on 28th November 1991. As 
						at that time they were still unemployed and that gave 
						rise to the criticism against the five months period 
						allowed by the court. Counsel referred to Ghana Cocoa 
						Marketing Board v. Agbettoh [1984-86] 1 GLR 122 and 
						submitted that the plaintiffs should be awarded 24 
						months salary.&nbsp; Agbettoh&#8217;s case must be studied very 
						carefully.&nbsp; It has often been cited as if it ever sought 
						to or did lay an inflexible rule that must be applied in 
						all cases and to the effect that in all cases of 
						wrongful dismissals the period of which damages should 
						be awarded must be 24 months. That case in my view 
						should not be so construed for it did not lay down any 
						such rule.&nbsp; The plaintiff/respondents in that case were 
						dismissed from their employment on 26th November 1979.&nbsp; 
						The High Court had declared their dismissals unlawful 
						and also granted the defendants an order of perpetual 
						injunction to restrain the defendants from ejecting them 
						from their bungalows. The Board sought a reversal of 
						this judgment, and the Court of Appeal said at page 131 
						that it saw some practical difficulties in it as well as 
						paying them their salaries.&nbsp; These were that to affirm 
						the order would amount to securing them bungalows they 
						had when they were in actual service of the board.&nbsp; To 
						also order that they were paid for the period during 
						which they did not work for the Board would be to set 
						their face against realities.&nbsp; The court went on to say 
						that the reality of the situation was that although de 
						jure they were technically in the service of the Board, 
						de facto, they had ceased to be so since November 1979. 
						Considering all the circumstances of the case the court 
						ordered the appellant board to compensate each 
						respondent as compensation, two year&#8217;s salary from 
						November 1979. In the result the call for the workers to 
						be paid their full salaries would be as if they were in 
						actual rather than constructive service of the board.&nbsp; 
						Those order where disaffirmed and set aside. When it was 
						considered that the Court of Appeal gave its judgment on 
						8th November 1984, then it meant that the period run 
						from the date of the dismissals, that was 26th November 
						1979 and ended on 26 November 1981. It certainly did not 
						cover the whole period between the date of the dismissal 
						to the date of the judgment, 8th November 1984, a period 
						of five years.&nbsp; The reality of the case did not allow 
						that to be done.&nbsp; So that what Agbettoh&#8217;s could safely 
						be said to have decided was that in awarding the period 
						for which the award should run the court must be guided 
						by the reality of the case, or &#8220;all the circumstances&#8221;, 
						of each case in particular.&nbsp; Once again I make bold to 
						say that Agbettoh did not lay it down as an inflexible 
						rule that in all cases of wrongful dismissals a 
						successful plaintiff must at all cost be awarded two 
						years salary.&nbsp; Rather it is clear from that case that in 
						awarding damages for wrongful dismissals the court was 
						enjoined to look at the realities of each particular 
						case.&nbsp; More importantly, the court should be careful not 
						to make any award that would tend to show that the 
						worker was being paid for work he did not do.&nbsp; I 
						therefore refuse to follow that case and make that 
						award.&nbsp; Learned counsel for the respondent submitted 
						that even if the dismissals were found to be 
						unconscionable, the workers were entitled to one month&#8217;s 
						salary, as that would be in lieu of notice.&nbsp; A similar 
						point was made in Hemans v. G.N.T.C. [1978] GLR 4, where 
						it was held as per holding (3) at page 5 that where the 
						compensation for lawful termination of contract of 
						employment was one month&#8217;s pay, it would appear 
						preposterous to award the same one month&#8217;s salary where 
						the termination was unlawful.&nbsp; The C.A proceeded to 
						award what was felt to be just in the case.&nbsp; In this 
						case too I do not think it would be any less 
						preposterous if I should accede to the submissions of 
						counsel&nbsp;&nbsp; for the respondents.&nbsp; I rather reject that 
						submission.&nbsp; I also wish to state that that the 
						cross-appellants were under an obligation to minimize 
						their losses by seeking and obtaining alternative jobs 
						was emphasized upon at p131. It was therefore wrong for 
						counsel for the appellants to submit &#8220;the 
						defendant/appellant did not also lead evidence that work 
						was readily available but the cross-appellant have 
						refused to work&#8221;. By so saying, counsel was putting the 
						onus of proof on the defendants and that was wrong.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Another submission by 
						the cross/appellants that must be considered with all 
						seriousness was the one that went as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;I will submit that the 
						current salary assigned to positions that they were 
						occupying should be the proper method of compensating 
						them.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is instructive to 
						learn that a not too dissimilar claim was put up in 
						Arkorful v. State Fishing Corporation [1991] 2 GLR 348.&nbsp; 
						In the present case no such claim like &#8216; the estimated 
						current value (at the date of judgment) of salaries from 
						&#8230;&#8217; was made.&nbsp; Osei-Hwere JA (as he then was) said of 
						this claim that he did not think he could admit such a 
						claim, for the fear that if entertained would open the 
						flood gates to embrace such an economic loss as a new 
						head in assessing damages in breach of contract.&nbsp; That 
						per se would not prevent this court from making that 
						award if there was evidence to support it.&nbsp; I have read 
						the reply to the submissions in response by the 
						respondents and I must confess it did not appear to me 
						that the decision in Arkorful&#8217;s case on a claim based on 
						the &#8220;estimated current value&#8221; at the date of judgment 
						was well appreciated.&nbsp; I do not think counsel for the 
						cross appellants succeeded in satisfying me that where a 
						court was considering the award of damages the yardstick 
						should be the estimated current value of the lost 
						salaries.&nbsp; Like Osei-Hwere J, I also think that 
						invitation is still dangerous and I reject it.&nbsp; If 
						anything at all, it is the lost salary as it was at the 
						date of the wrongful dismissal that must be used in the 
						computation.&nbsp; In other words, a judge who proceeds to 
						award damages for wrongful dismissal is to make only a 
						fair and reasonable estimate of the period within which 
						the plaintiff could secure an alternative employment.&nbsp; 
						At that stage he would not, and in fact he was not 
						expected to know for sure how long it would take the 
						dismissal plaintiff to do that.&nbsp; The judge has no 
						clairvoyance and has to rely on his judicial experience, 
						his knowledge on the general trend on the labor front 
						with special reference on the availability of jobs or 
						otherwise, as a guide.&nbsp; After all said and done the 
						award of damages is a matter entirely within the 
						discretion of the judge and the appellate court is sloth 
						to interfere with its exercise except as in well laid 
						circumstances.&nbsp; I proceed at this stage to state only a 
						few of them as are germane to this appeal.</span></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;I should like to add a 
						few words about the jurisdiction of this court in 
						appeals where the only contention or one of the 
						contentions is that the damages awarded by a judge 
						hearing a case without a jury are excessive.&nbsp; It is not 
						possible to say that the tests, which have been laid 
						down in cases, like Philips v. London &amp; South Western 
						Railway Company (1879) 5 CPD. 280 apply to an appeal 
						from a judge trying a case without a jury, because an 
						appeal is a rehearing by the court with regard to all 
						the questions involved in the action including what 
						damages ought to be awarded, but though the established 
						rules with regard to the decisions of juries do not 
						apply to appeals from the decision of judges trying case 
						without the assistance of a jury, I do not think it 
						right to say that this court will be disinclined to 
						reverse the finding of a trial judge as to the amount 
						of&nbsp; damages merely because they think that if they had 
						tried the case in the first instance they would have 
						given a lesser sum.&nbsp; In order to justify reversing the 
						trial judge on the question on the amount of damages it 
						will generally be necessary that this court should be 
						convinced either that the judge acted upon some wrong 
						principle of law or that the amount awarded was so 
						extremely high or so very small as to make it, in the 
						judgment of this court, an entirely erroneous estimate 
						of the damage to which the plaintiff is entitled&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Similarly, in Davies v. 
						Powell Dufryn Associated Collieries Ltd. [1942] A.C. 
						601; [1942] 1 All E.R. 657, HL. Lord Wright said at

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Where however the 
						award is that of the judge alone, the appeal is by way 
						of rehearing on damages as on all other issues, but as 
						there is so much room for individual choice so that the 
						assessment of damages is more like an exercise of 
						discretion than an ordinary act of decision, the 
						appellate court is particularly slow to reverse the 
						trial judge on a question of the amount of damages.&nbsp; It 
						is difficult to lay down any precise rule which will 
						over all cases, but a good general guide is given by 
						Greer L.J. in Flint v Lovell [1935] 1K.B. 354, at 360.&nbsp; 
						In effect, the court, before it interferes with an award 
						of damages, should be satisfied that the judge has acted 
						on wrong principle of law, or has misapprehended the 
						facts or has for these or other reasons made a wholly 
						erroneous estimate of the damage suffered.&nbsp; It is not 
						enough that there is a balance of opinion or 
						preference.&nbsp; The scale must go down heavily against the 
						figure attached if the appellate court is to interfere 
						whether on the ground of excess or insufficiency&#8221;.

						<span style="font-family: Arial">Lord Upjohn referred to 
						this dictum with approval in Yorkshire Electricity Board 
						v. Naylor [1968] A.C. 529 at page 539, His Lordship made 
						an observation that was worthy of note.&nbsp; He said that 
						the award of damages was a matter that was better and 
						safely left to the experience and common sense of judges 
						who day by day had to judge of these matters. I think 
						when they had used their experience in these matters to 
						make an award they had exercised a judicial discretion.&nbsp; 
						An appellate court would scarcely interfere with the 
						exercise of this discretion except where they fell foul 
						of the principles stated in the case cited above.&nbsp; See 
						also Bressaah v. Asante [1965] GLR 117, S.C.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Bearing the above 
						principles in mind it could safely be said that the 
						trial judge did not make an erroneous let alone a wholly 
						erroneous estimate of the period within which the 
						cross-appellants could have secured an alternative job.&nbsp; 
						All the criticism levelled against his estimate was not 
						well founded. That was very much so when it was 
						considered that there was evidence that one of the 
						plaintiffs had obtained an employment within three 
						months after their dismissals.&nbsp; If one could do it why 
						could the others not do the same thing within the same 
						period?&nbsp; In the result this court has no reason to 
						interfere with the period awarded by the trial judge.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The major question 
						raised by this appeal is whether or not the 
						cross-appellants were paid all their benefits upon their 
						dismissals?&nbsp; The law is settled that where a worker was 
						wrongfully dismissed he is compensated by damages. And 
						here I find the dismissals to be wrongful. The 
						cross-appellants led evidence that showed conclusively 
						that it was the practice at the company for workers to 
						take I.O.Us from the cashier and to repay later.&nbsp; It was 
						when management discovered that the privilege had been 
						abused that new measures were put in place to check it. 
						The respondents pleaded that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;12. Defendants further 
						say that the unauthorized I.O.Us were taken by the 
						plaintiffs between June 1989 and January 1990 when a 
						new&nbsp; Management with sole authority to approve all 
						disbursement of funds&nbsp; was running the affairs of the 
						Factory&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This averment was 
						denied in paragraph 2 of the plaintiff&#8217;s reply. With 
						that the burden fell on the defendants to prove that the 
						cross-appellants took the I.O.Us after the date pleaded 
						by them i.e. June 1989 and January 1990. This in my 
						view, based on the perusal of the evidence as a whole, 
						the defendants failed to do. Certainly, the fact that 
						the taking of I.O.Us was very rampant among the workers 
						did not justify that conduct. On the other hand, the 
						fact that management frowned upon that conduct after a 
						certain point in time did not mean whoever took it at 
						any time committed an act of dishonesty for which he 
						could be dismissed summarily. What was rather important 
						was that the defendants proved that the cross-appellants 
						by passed the procedure laid down after June 1989 and 
						January 1990, in taking those loans.&nbsp; That kind of 
						evidence was not forthcoming from the defendants and 
						that made their dismissals of&nbsp; the cross-appellants 
						wrongful. The remedy available to a worker who was 
						wrongfully dismissed lay in damages. How much that 
						should be was stated in Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v. 
						Agbettoh (supra) at page 129 to be pecuniary damages. A 
						reading of Nartey-Tokoli v. Volta Aluminium Company 
						Limited (No2) [1989-90] GLR 341, would show that these 
						would include salaries and entitlements lost over the 
						period.&nbsp; The trial judge, in all fairness to him awarded 
						the cross-appellants five months salary for each 
						affected worker plus a housing allowance within the same 
						period. If anything at all it was against the 
						computation that a complaint was made to the effect that 
						it was wrongly made. Counsel for the respondent company 
						has conceded that point. We ourselves have also found 
						the criticism to be well founded. We agree that the 
						first plaintiff earned ¢25,488 but not ¢25,000, the 2nd 
						earned ¢15,820 but not ¢15,000 as stated by the judge.&nbsp; 
						Multiplying this figure by the five months period we 
						get&nbsp; ¢329,440.00 and ¢79,100.00 for the 1st and 2nd 
						plaintiffs respectively.&nbsp; We set aside the sums awarded 
						for these plaintiffs as salaries lost and substitute 
						them with these.&nbsp; With regard to the figures for the 
						third plaintiff, we find that he earned ¢20,779.00 a 
						month and for the five-month period he was entitled to 
						the&nbsp; ¢103,895.00 awarded by the trial judge as lost 
						salaries.&nbsp; We find no fault with the calculation and we 
						do affirm it.&nbsp; Each plaintiff was also entitled to 25% 
						of his monthly salary housing allowance.&nbsp; For the five 
						months the first plaintiff would be entitled to&nbsp; 
						¢31,860.00, the second plaintiff, ¢19,770.00.&nbsp; We make 
						those awards for the 2 plaintiffs.&nbsp; The third was 
						earning&nbsp; ¢20,799.00 a month so that his lost salary for 
						the three month period was ¢103,995.&nbsp; It is in evidence 
						that it took three months for the third plaintiff to 
						secure another job, so the judge should computed his 
						lost salary by using that period of time.&nbsp; That would 
						amount to ¢65,397.00. His lost housing allowance over 
						the period would be ¢16,449.25. This we award in favour 
						of the third plaintiff.&nbsp; It could be seen that in some 
						respects there were some arithmetical errors in the 
						computations by the trial judge and this was a ground 
						upon which the cross-appeal would be and has been 
						allowed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There was this appeal 
						to this court to order interest to run on these sums for 
						the period running from 1990 to an unspecified time. The 
						reply was that the plaintiffs did not put in any claim 
						for interest and none could be awarded in their favour.&nbsp; 
						The issue is should interest be awarded only when it has 
						been claimed specifically on the writ? I reckon that 
						under the English rules interest must be endorsed on the 
						writ before it can be awarded, see Order 18r8 of the 
						English Rules of the Supreme Court, 1965 and the notes 
						thereon in the Supreme Court Practice, 1993, paragraph 
						6/2/10 at page 36. Under this rule, all claims for 
						interest must be pleaded.&nbsp; In Ghana, the practice seems 
						to be as was stated in &#8220;Practice and Procedure in the 
						Trial Court &amp; Tribunals of Ghana&#8221;, by S.A.Brobbey. The 
						subject of &#8216;Interest in claims for money&#8217; was treated at 
						Chapter 13 at page 355 to 370. It was stated at page 355 
						that interest is founded either on an agreement between 
						the contracting parties or on statutory provisions. In 
						this case the claim for interest has not been made 
						because of any agreement by the parties.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that 
						situation the rule is certain that interest must be 
						claimed and proved before it can be awarded.&nbsp; The basis 
						of the award of interest in the present case was that 
						the plaintiffs have had some sums of money awarded in 
						their favour.&nbsp; These were monies found by the court to 
						belong to the plaintiffs. The defendants deprived the 
						plaintiffs of the use and enjoyment of those monies for 
						the period stated by the trial judge, i.e. five months.&nbsp; 
						The law on this point is as was stated by Lord Herschell 
						L.C. in London, Chatham &amp; Dover Railway Co. v. South 
						Eastern Railway Co [1893] A.C. 429 at 437, H.L.&nbsp; It is 
						that interest is a sort of compensation or damages for 
						the wrongful withholding of another person&#8217;s money; see 
						also Ghana Commercial Bank v. Binoo-Okai [1982-83] GLR 
						74; Royal Dutch Airlines (K.L.M) v. Farmex Ltd. 
						[1989-90] 2 GLR 623 S.C. If interest is awarded for 
						wrongful retention of another person&#8217;s money then it 
						stood to reason that the duration of the award should be 
						the same as the wrongful retention.&nbsp; In this case the 
						period has been put at five months. The rate of interest 
						is statutorily put at the prevailing commercial lending 
						rate.</span></p>

						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiffs claimed, 
						as per their amended statement of claim and writ of 
						summons &#8220;Payment of all entitlements due the plaintiffs 
						since February 1990&#8221;. What these were are to be gleaned 
						from the collective agreement.&nbsp; That was exhibit D at 
						the trial.&nbsp; Article 52 was on &#8216;End of Service 
						Benefits&#8221;.&nbsp; They were gratuities paid to an employee on 
						leaving the service of the employer.&nbsp; The calculation of 
						such entitlements were as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">a.&nbsp; &#8220;Employees with

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I take judicial notice 
						of the fact that in December 1990 the Government of 
						Ghana froze all End of Service Benefits by a circular.&nbsp; 
						Managements of affected organizations were made to enter 
						into arrangements with workers on how to compute and 
						effect payment of these benefits.&nbsp; The payment of end of 
						service benefits were not cancelled by the Government 
						altogether.&nbsp; But before the freeze in&nbsp; December 1990, 
						the plaintiffs had been wrongfully dismissed in&nbsp; 
						February of the same year.&nbsp; The end of service benefit 
						had rather been earned but not paid.&nbsp; They remained 
						unpaid even when the plaintiffs were dismissed. I am of 
						the view that when they were dismissed and they were 
						leaving the service of the defendants, they should have 
						computed and paid the end of service benefits to them in 
						accordance with the agreed terms of service.&nbsp; In 
						fairness to the trial judge he made orders for the
