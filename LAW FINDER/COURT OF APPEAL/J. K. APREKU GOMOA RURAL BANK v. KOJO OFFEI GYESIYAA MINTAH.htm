						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Briefly the facts of 
						the case are that Joseph Kweku Gyesi (deceased) was a 
						brother of the 1st defendant and married to the 2nd 
						defendant in his lifetime. In his lifetime the late 
						Joseph Gyesi was a customer of the Gomoa Rural Bank 
						Apam, with which he kept a current account. On 30th 
						March 1989 the late Gyesi paid a Co-operative Bank 
						cheque number 147043 having the face value of ¢1,680,000 
						in his account. Without waiting for the cheque to be 
						cleared, its value was immediately credited to the 
						account of Gyesi by the Bank. Subsequently the cheque 
						was dishonoured. The bank then debited the account of 
						the deceased with the value of the cheque, which had 
						already been credited to his account. When 1st plaintiff 
						(Joseph Kofi Apreku) the bank manager realised that the 
						deceased&#8217;s indebtedness to the bank was in the region of 
						¢2,000,000 as indicated by the bank statement, Exhibit 
						E, he invited the deceased to provide security for his 
						indebtedness to the bank.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The testimony of 1st 
						plaintiff which was accepted by the Court was that the 
						deceased took his own witnesses to the bank at Apam 
						where he signed a document, Exhibit D which was 
						captioned &#8220;Simple Equitable Pledge&#8221; by which he pledges 
						his three vehicles as security for his indebtedness. The 
						evidence shows that not long after Exhibit D had been 
						signed the deceased died without paying any portion of 
						his indebtedness. The Manager who gave evidence as the 
						1st plaintiff was faced with the difficulty of 
						recovering the debt. He therefore caused to be seized 
						one of the three vehicles which had been provided as 
						security. In all the vehicle was detained for eight 
						months but later it was given back to the driver who had 
						driven it immediately before the seizure. It is in 
						evidence that when the 1st defendant arranged to get the 
						vehicle repaired the bank manager caused its seizure by 
						soldiers from Gondor Barracks to where the 1st defendant 
						was taken after the arrest. He was later released and 
						the vehicle was repaired for the use on the road.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Court below came to 
						the decision that the credit loan advance totaling 
						¢2million was not paid. This among other things to be 
						discussed later in this judgment compelled him to give 
						judgment in favour of the plaintiffs and to dismiss the 
						defendants counter-claim.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendants have 
						appealed against the decision of the trial judge on a 
						number of grounds. Of these I consider the original 
						ground one namely &#8220;The judgment is against the weight of 
						the evidence&#8221; very crucial for the determination of this 
						appeal. The undisputed evidence on record is that the 
						deceased paid into his current account with the Gomoa 
						Rural Bank the cheque Exhibit A and its face value was 
						immediately credited to his account. It is also not 
						disputed that at the time the cheque was paid the 
						deceased's accounts were in the red to the tune of 
						¢557,677.40 as evidenced by the two bank statements, 
						Exhibit E and one. It. is also in evidence from the bank 
						statements that before the cheque was returned as 
						dishonoured the deceased withdrew monies amounting to 
						¢1,270,000 from his current account. So that when the 
						dishonoured cheque was debited, the deceased was 
						indebted to the bank to the tune of ¢2,000,000.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiffs&#8217; 
						witnesses testified and their testimony was believed by 
						the trial judge that when the deceased asked Insaido 
						(PW2) and Otabil (PW3) to accompany him to the bank 
						where he intended to use his three vehicles to provide 
						security, he disclosed to them that he was indebted to 
						the bank to the tune of ¢2,000,000. Kwesi Otabil (PW3) 
						told the Court inter alia that &#8220;Gyesi told me and PW2 
						that he had collected a loan from the Bank Manager. He 
						told me the loan was ¢2,000,000&#8221;. The judgment of the 
						trial judge shows that the testimonies of PW2 and PW3 
						left him in no doubt that the deceased was present at 
						the bank when the document was executed. He believed 
						that the signature and thumb print of PW2 and PW3 
						respectively appeared on the document as witnesses 
						because they were taken to the bank for that purpose. On 
						the question whether the deceased infact signed Exhibit 
						D and thereby acknowledged his indebtedness to the bank, 
						there is the undisputed evidence as indicated by the 
						bank statement Exhibit E and one that the deceased was 
						indeed indebted to the bank before Exhibit D was 
						executed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Defense counsel 
						contended in his written address that vehicle No. GN 
						4625 which was seized at the instance of the 1st 
						plaintiff was acquired by the deceased sometime after 
						Exhibit D. If this were true how could the plaintiffs 
						have known the vehicle No. GN 4625 as one of the 
						vehicles to be pledged. There was no evidence before the 
						court that Exhibit D was backdated to give impression 
						that the vehicles were pledged before the deceased was 
						granted the credit facility which permitted him to 
						withdraw. As said the defendant did not produce any oral 
						or documentary evidence that the deceased bought the 
						Vehicle No. GN 4625 in July 1989 after Exhibit D. The 
						mere assertion that vehicle No. GN 4625 was purchased in 
						July 1989 without proof was rejected by the trial judge.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendants&#8217; counsel 
						further raised a serious contention by attacking the 
						signature of the deceased on Exhibit D as not genuine. 
						The defendants had to call a hand writing expert in the 
						person of DW5 to testify as to the authenticity of the 
						signature of the deceased appearing in Exhibit D.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Concerning the weight 
						of an expert&#8217;s evidence, Phipson puts it at page 403 of 
						his book, Phipson on Evidence (9th edition) thus &#8220;The 
						testimony of experts is often considered to be of slight 
						value since they are proverbially though unwillingly 
						biased in favour of the side which calls them&#8221; see also 
						Tackie &amp; ors vs. The State (1964) GLR p. 262 SC: Held 
						&#8220;There is no rule of law that evidence of hand writing 
						can only be given by handwriting expert. A trial judge 
						is entitled to rely on the evidence of non-expert whose 
						testimony is tested before in cross-examination&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this case the 
						learned trial judge observed the witness and after 
						examining his evidence came to the following conclusion 
						&#8220;in my view therefore his evidence that came out with 
						the conclusion that the signature on Exhibit D was not 
						that of the deceased was unreliable. On the other hand 
						there is evidence of PW2 and PW3 who were present when 
						the deceased was supposed to sign the document..&#8230;&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He concluded &#8220;Therefore 
						in my opinion the signature of the deceased appearing on 
						Exhibit D taken together with the evidence adduced on 
						behalf of the plaintiff was a clear admission by the 
						deceased of the indebtedness to the bank&#8221;. After reading 
						the record of proceeding I am satisfied that the 
						findings of the learned trial judge constitute a correct 
						analyses and inference from the facts on record.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Regarding the 
						defendant's counter-claim there is evidence on record 
						which was accepted by the court that the detention of 
						the vehicle was in effort to get a purchaser to buy the 
						vehicle in fulfilment of a settlement between the 
						plaintiffs, and the deceased's family who had accepted 
						the indebtedness of the deceased to the bank that the 
						vehicle should be sold. The trial judge found as a fact 
						that there was understanding between the lst plaintiff 
						and the family of the deceased that the vehicle should 
						be detained for a prospective purchaser to be found. 
						That the proceeds of the sale of the vehicle were to be 
						used in settling the indebtedness of the deceased to the 
						bank. In respect of the 1st defendant&#8217;s, counter-claim, 
						it is my view that the learned trial judge was right in 
						holding that there was no evidence that the lst 
						plaintiff personally directed the arrest detention and 
						assault of the 1st defendant. The 1st defendant could 
						not call any witness to corroborate his assertion. He 
						did not produce any medical report to show that indeed 
						anybody assaulted him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned trial judge 
						in my opinion made a critical analyses of the evidence 
						in the light of the issues raised before him. It seems 
						to me that the decision the learned judge arrived at is 
						correct and supported by the evidence. It should not be 
						disturbed without clear proof that it is wrong and I 
						fail to find proof, in the instant case, that it is 
						wrong. The settled law is that an appellate court should 
						not reverse findings of fact made by a trial court 
						unless those findings are not justified see Atade vs. 
						Ladzekpo (1981) GLR 218 and Nkansah vs. Adjebeng and 
						Another (1961) GLR 465.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my view the appeal 
						cannot succeed on any of the grounds of appeal and I 
						would dismiss the appeal.</span></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The view expressed by 
						my learned brother Essilfie-Bondzie, JA. coincides with 
						my own views on the matter, and I agree that the appeal 
						be dismissed for the good reasons he has given. There is 
						not very much I can usefully add.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">However, let me avail 
						myself of this opportunity to make a brief comment by 
						way of an addendum in connection with the application 
						for amendment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A careful perusal of 
						the record of proceedings reveals that on the 19/6/91 a 
						motion on Notice for Leave to amend the statement of 
						Defense and counter-claim was filed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At page 103 is the 
						Plaintiff&#8217;s Affidavit in opposition.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At page 105 is an 
						amended statement of Defense and counter-claim of 1st 
						and 2nd defendants, &#8220;pursuant to leave having been 
						granted by the Court on the lst November, 1991.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Yet from the 19-6-91 
						when the &#8220;MOTION ON NOTICE&#8221; was filed there is no record 
						as to when the MOTION was moved, let alone granted. 
						Indeed I have thoroughly gone through the record of 
						proceedings, but I am regretfully unable to find any 
						evidence of the motion having been moved, especially 
						when it was being vehemently opposed. Nor is there any 
						record of leave having ever been granted.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">When, as in this case, 
						a party files a MOTION NOTICE for leave to amend a 
						pleading, supported by an Affidavit in opposition 
						thereto it is essential for the trial judge to grant or 
						refuse the application for leave and thereafter to make 
						a specific Ruling on the pursuant Motion as to whether 
						the pursuant MOTION was granted or refused and the 
						reasons therefor. This must be evident from the record 
						of proceedings.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the absence of any 
						such record, the parties must be deemed to have 
						abandoned the MOTION, and the hearing must proceed 
						accordingly as if no application for amendment was ever 
						filed as pursued. In other words the Motion lapses.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instant case, 
						rejection of the proposed amendment would make no 
						material difference to the merits of the appeal. But it 
						could be crucial in other matters.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As already indicated, I 
						share the views expressed by my learned brother. The 
						appeal shall be dismissed accordingly and the judgment 
						of the High Court affirmed.</span></p>
