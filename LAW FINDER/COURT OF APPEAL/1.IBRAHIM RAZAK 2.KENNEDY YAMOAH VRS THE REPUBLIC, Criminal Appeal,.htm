						This an appeal by the two accused persons against their 
						conviction and sentence by the Trial High Court sitting 
						at Sekondi on 7th December 2005 on three counts of 
						robbery. The facts of the case are that the complainants 
						lived in three houses situate about 100 meters apart at 
						West Anaji in Takoradi. On 27th July 2005 at about 
						1.00am 5 armed men one of whom wore a face mask attacked 
						the complainants in the three houses one after the other 
						and made away with a total sum of Gh¢10,350,000.00, 31/2 
						pieces of cloth, 2 gold wrist watches and 2 mobile 
						phones after assaulting some of the complainants. On 
						17th August 2005 the 1st Appellant was arrested on a tip 
						off. On 24th August 2005 the 2nd Appellant who lived in 
						the same house with 1st Appellant was also arrested. The 
						two were later identified by the complainants at an 
						identification parade as being among the five who 
						attacked them on 27th July 2005. After a summary trial 
						without jury the trial judge convicted the appellants 
						and sentenced each to life imprisonment on each of the 
						three counts of robbery and ordered that they be 
						repatriated to their home country Nigeria when they 
						attain the age of 70 years. It is against the conviction 
						and sentence that the accused persons have appealed. The 
						first ground argued by Counsel for the Appellants is 
						ground 5 of the notice of appeal which states that &quot;The 
						trial judge is tainted with bias and real likelihood of 
						bias by importing discrimination into the judicial task 
						of having and assessing evidence, when by law a) All 
						persons shall be equal before the law b) A person shall 
						not be discriminated against on grounds of race, ethnic 
						origin and/or social or economic status&quot; Counsel argued 
						that the trial judge allowed the country he believed the 
						appellants came from to influence his decision when he 
						held that they were aliens who should be deported to 
						Nigeria, their home country when they are certified to 
						be 70 years of age. By this ground Counsel for the 
						appellant was imputing bias or the real likelihood of 
						bias on the part of the judge in determining the case 
						before him. For a judge to be imputed with bias there 
						should be evidence of pecuniary or proprietary interest 
						in the outcome of the case. As stated in the case of 
						ADZAKU VRS GALENKU (1974)1 GLR 198 to invalidate a 
						decision, the allegation of bias must be supported by 
						evidence. A mere or reasonable suspicion of bias was not 
						enough; the law recognized not only actual bias but that 
						interest, other than interest of a direct pecuniary or 
						proprietary nature, which gave rise to a real likelihood 
						of bias. Counsel did not provide any evidence of bias. 
						On the contrary there exists at page 15 of the record of 
						proceedings the evidence in chief of the 1st appellant 
						Line 32 - my father is from Lagos, my mother is from 
						Gambaga, Northern part of Ghana. I was born in Nigeria. 
						I schooled in Nigeria. I lived for 22 year in Nigeria 
						------------ I hold a Nigerian passport. The 2nd 
						Appellant also stated at page 20 line 5 that &quot;I have 
						been in Ghana since 2001. I am married, my wife is in 
						Nigeria with my one year old child --------------- I 
						changed in Nigeria, my documents are in Nigeria&quot;. There 
						thus seems to be evidence on record to justify the trial 
						judge's comments that the appellants were aliens who 
						must be deported back to Nigeria. In exercising his 
						power in a trial a judge has discretion to pass comments 
						on matters arising from the trial which cannot be 
						questioned unless it is shown that the judge has 
						violated his duty to be fair and candid or that he has 
						been arbitrary and capricious in the conduct of the 
						trial. As this is not the case in the instant case this 
						ground of appeal fails and it is dismissed. The second 
						ground argued in this appeal is ground 1 of the notice 
						of appeal which is &quot;That the trial judge did not give 
						any consideration whatsoever to the alibi pleaded by the 
						2nd appellant as confirmed by PW4 (the police 
						investigator) in his evidence which occasioned 
						substantial miscarriage of justice to the appellant&quot;. 
						Counsel for the appellant quoted PW4's evidence that 
						when he checked on the alibi of 2nd appellant at the 
						Hotel Chavez at New Achimota, the hotel attendant 
						confirmed the 2nd appellant and Albert Koomson checked 
						in on 24th July 2005 and vacated on 28th July 2005. 
						According to Counsel for the 2nd Appellant the judge 
						rejected this evidence on the basis of the appellant's 
						girl friend who could not be specific on the days 2nd 
						appellant spent with her. Counsel argued that whether 
						the 2nd appellant was in a hotel at New Achimota or with 
						his girl friend at Achimota the fact still remained that 
						he was not in Takoradi let alone being at the scene of 
						robbery. I have read the judgment of the trial judge and 
						I am satisfied that the trial judge adequately 
						considered the defence of alibi put up by the 2nd 
						Appellant. The trial judge perused the defence of alibi 
						but at the end rejected it as a ruse. The trial judge at 
						page 48 of the proceedings noted that the 2nd Appellant 
						gave two statements to the police during the 
						investigation. In the first statement given on 24th 
						August 2005 admitted as Exhibit F the 2nd Appellant 
						stated that &quot;On the 27th August 2005 I was in Accra to 
						collect my goods and therefore could not be part of the 
						robbery. If the police want the truth they can contact 
						one Osei Nyanko of Dansoman and find out from him&quot;. In 
						the second statement Exhibit G taken 16 days later the 
						2nd Appellant stated that &quot;I travelled to Accra together 
						with my brother Albert Koomson on 24th July 2005 and 
						slept in a hotel called Chez at New Achimota. During my 
						time there which was from 24th July to 26th July 2005 my 
						girl friend one Eartha used to visit me in the day time. 
						This is because I was using the same bed with my brother 
						Albert Koonnson. I have to state also that it was Albert 
						Koomson's name that we used in the registration card. We 
						left the hotel around 12.00 and went to my girl friend's 
						house at Nii Boye's and slept with her up to 28th July 
						2005 before I came back to Takoradi&quot;. The trial judge 
						noted at page 48 of the record of proceedings that &quot;To 
						my utter surprise Osei Nyarko of Dansoman by whom the 
						2nd accused was to establish his alibi did not feature 
						at all in the second statement. Now it was a hotel at 
						New Achimota registered not in the name of 2nd Accused 
						but in the name of Albert Koomson&quot; and a girl friend 
						Eartha who testified as witnesses. At page 53 of the 
						record of proceedings the trial judge also noted the 
						uncomplimentary demeanor of the girlfriend Eartha before 
						contradicting the details of her evidence with that of 
						the 2nd accused now 2nd appellant. To quote from the 
						judgment at page 53 of the record. &quot;Eartha said they 
						have been together for a year. 2nd accused put it at 5 
						months. Eartha said the 2nd accused had slept in her 
						house on two occasions. Later she changed to about five 
						(5) times. 2nd accused said he has slept in her house 
						only once.According to Eartha the last time she spent 
						the night with 2nd accused was on 28th July 2005 {but 
						2nd accused said he left Accra in the afternoon of 28th 
						July 2005}. Eartha goes on to say on the 26 we ate rice, 
						and on the 28th we ate rice in my house. I did not eat 
						with him on the 27th On the contrary the 2 nd accused 
						said on the 27th he was at a restaurant with her and 
						they ate Banku and Okro. Then in the evening she 
						prepared bread with eggs and sardines. Eartha said 2nd 
						Accused left on the 29th while 2nd accused said he left 
						on the 28th,, I have quoted at length page 53 of the 
						record to show that the trial judge considered the 
						defence of alibi but rejected it. There is on record 
						many other contradictions in the evidence of alibi put 
						up by the 2nd Appellant and his witnesses which makes 
						the defence of alibi highly improbable. For example at 
						page 24 line 10 the prosecutrix asked the 2nd Appellant 
						during cross- examination. Q. what did you do on the 
						27th A. I was in Accra with my girlfriend. The whole day 
						I was with her driving about in my car. At page 28 line 
						40 when the prosecutrix asked DW1 Albert Koomson during 
						cross examination. Q. On the 27th what did you do? A. 
						Kennedy and me drove round town. Eartha was at home. 
						When Eartha Lartey who testified as CW1 was asked on 
						page 25 of the record Q. Did you prepare food on the 
						27th? A. I can't remember Q. What did you do on 27th? A. 
						I can't remember. At page 55 of the record of 
						proceedings the trial judge had this to say. &quot;The 
						robbery took place from the midnight of the 26th through 
						to the early hours of 27th. I find from the evidence 
						that the inconsistency in the evidence of the three key 
						players is mostly displayed from what they say happened 
						from the 26th to the 27th. Why did the 2nd Accused 
						abandon his alibi with Osei Nyarko of Dansoman. Why did 
						the l Accused not mention the trip of his brother in his 
						statement? How could it be that you go on a business 
						trip yet on cross examination you could not name one 
						customer or a place you visited in pursuit of the 
						business. The reason is that the trip is a trick. I find 
						that the alibi was an attempt to cover up and outwit 
						detection. It has failed. I reject the defence of alibi 
						of 2nd accused. But under our law as explained earlier, 
						that is not what would make the 2nd accused culpable. 
						The prosecution must discharge the burden cast on it by 
						law. And to my mind that has been done. Both accused 
						have been identified&quot;. It would be seen from the above 
						that the learned trial judge considered the defence of 
						alibi put up by the 2nd Appellant but rejected it and we 
						think he was entitled to reject it on the evidence 
						before him. The trial judge also found from the above 
						that &quot;Both have been identified&quot;. The 1st Appellant was 
						identified by all three complainants who also gave 
						evidence to that effect. The 1st Appellant has not 
						challenged his identification. With regards to the 2nd 
						Appellant none of the complainants testified that 2nd 
						appellant was identified. PW4 however testified that the 
						2nd appellant was identified by PW2 and a photograph 
						taken during the identification parade was tendered as 
						Exhibit C. As a result of this piece of evidence not 
						being challenged or denied by the defence the trial 
						judge overruled the prosecutions application to be 
						allowed to recall PW2 to testify in respect of the 
						identification of 2nd accused. The issue of the 
						identification of 2nd accused was confirmed by the 2nd 
						accused himself when in his evidence in chief he 
						testified at page 23 line 39 as follows. &quot;The next day 
						there was an identification parade. On the day of the 
						identification parade I was pointed out by a lady (PW2) 
						and a tall and fair man was also pointed out together 
						with another man&quot;. The trial judge was therefore right 
						in finding that &quot;Both have been identified&quot;. The third 
						ground argued by the lawyer for the appellants is that 
						the investigator PW4 admitted under cross-examination 
						that in all 4 people were pointed out as those who 
						committed the robbery on 27th July 2005 but only two 
						were charged. The answer to the lawyers query is to be 
						found at the end of the prosecutors (PW4), 
						cross-examination when he answered that the other two 
						people identified were brought in to form the role and 
						were not suspects. Counsel for the appellants did not 
						argue grounds 2 and 4 of the notice of appeal in his 
						written submission of the appellant's case so he is 
						deemed to have abandoned them. After going through the 
						record of proceedings and the appeal filed we are 
						satisfied that the conviction of the appellants on 
						charges of robbery was lawful and the appeal against 
						conviction is hereby dismissed.The lawyer for the 
						appellant lastly argued the trial judge sentenced the 
						appellants to life imprisonment which is too 
						harsh.Section 149 of the Criminal Offences Act 1960 Act 
						29 provides that &quot;A person who commits robbery commits a 
						first degree felony&quot;. Section 296 (1) of Criminal and 
						other Offences Act 30 of 1960 also provides that &quot;Where 
						a criminal offence is declared by an enactment to be a 
						first degree felony and the punishment for that offence 
						is not specified, a person convicted of that offence is 
						liable to imprisonment for life or any lesser term&quot;. It 
						was submitted for the Republic that the prevalence of 
						the offence of robbery, the intrinsic seriousness of the 
						offence, the degree of revulsion felt by law-abiding 
						citizens and the impunity with which the crime was 
						committed called for severe punishments to the 
						appellants to act as deterrent to those who intend to 
						engage in this heinous crime. However true this may be 
						the law sets life imprisonment as the maximum sentence 
						for armed robbery so life imprisonment is obviously on 
						the high side. In the circumstances of this case we will 
						set aside the sentence of life imprisonment imposed by 
						the trial court and substitute therefore a sentence of 
						30 years I.H.L on each count for each appellant. The 
						sentence are to run concurrently from the date of first 
						sentence. We also order that the accused person be 
						deported to their home country, Nigeria, after they have 
						served the sentence. COUNSEL: SAMUEL OFORI FOR THE 
						APPELLANTS</span></p>
