												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												TWUMASI, JA:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is an appeal from the 
												ruling of the High Court Accra, 
												delivered on the 11th November 
												1998. The court granted to the 
												respondents an order of 
												certiorari sought by them to 
												quash a decision of the Judicial 
												Committee of the Ga Traditional 
												Council, given on the 22nd 
												October 1997. The parties to the 
												proceedings before the Judicial 
												Committee had filed affidavits 
												in respect of the issue of 
												whether the party who had 
												instituted the proceedings had 
												locus standi or capacity to do 
												so. When the case came on for 
												hearing, the committee adopted a 
												procedure very much unique for 
												its brevity and simplicity. 
												Questions were addressed to the 
												parties to indicate whether they 
												had any oral evidence to add to 
												their respective affidavits and 
												each of them said they had none. 
												With this response, the 
												committee concluded the 
												proceedings and fixed a date for 
												ruling. On the due date, the 
												committee gave a final decision 
												on the merits based on the 
												affidavits. The defeated side, 
												the respondents herein 
												immediately commenced certiorari 
												proceedings before the High 
												Court, Accra on the following 
												grounds:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;(1) There is error apparent on 
												the face of the record in that 
												the trial judicial committee 
												failed to take VIVA VOCE 
												evidence on the issue of 
												capacity thereby depriving the 
												applicant (the respondent 
												herein) the opportunity of 
												establishing his capacity with 
												cogent evidence in accordance 
												with legal principles.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) The Judicial Committee not 
												having taken evidence had no 
												basis in declaring the 
												interested party as Nii Larbi 
												Mensah IV Sempe Asofotse of Nii 
												Larbi Mensah Stool Family of 
												Sempe and Ablekumah&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The High Court, constituted by 
												Gbadegbe J (as he then was) 
												predictably granted the 
												application for certiorari and 
												quashed the decision of the 
												Judicial Committee on the 
												following grounds stated in his 
												ruling at p.65 of the record of 
												appeal and I quote:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;There being no denial that the 
												facts on which the issue of 
												capacity was based was 
												challenged in my view the 
												tribunal was duty bound to give 
												the parties the opportunity of 
												hearing their various 
												depositions raised by 
												cross-examination. Authority 
												aside, I think that there can be 
												no denial that depositions when 
												not admitted must be proved by 
												oral evidence. So therefore 
												where as in this case the 
												tribunal instead of doing that 
												which was the only lawful avenue 
												open to it, rather left this to 
												the parties, I think that this 
												discloses a manifest error on 
												the record, Exhibit A&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellants impugned this 
												ruling by this appeal on two 
												grounds but argued only the 
												second which was as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The learned trial High Court 
												Judge erred in law in holding 
												that the Judicial Committee 
												ought to have taken VIVA VOCE 
												evidence in spite of the fact 
												that the parties at the hearing 
												openly said they did not have 
												anything to add to what they had 
												disposed to in their respective 
												affidavits.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Arguing the appeal on this 
												ground counsel for the 
												appellants contended that the 
												judicial committee acted right 
												because, as he put it, &#8220;the 
												judicial committees are inferior 
												tribunals and are therefore 
												entitled to conduct their 
												proceedings summarily, they are 
												also entitled to conduct their 
												proceedings according to 
												customary law.&#8221; He quoted in 
												support section 28 of the 
												Chieftaincy Act, 1971 (Act 370) 
												(replaced) which provides that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;28 (1) In exercise of the 
												jurisdiction conferred upon it 
												by section 15 of this Act, a 
												Traditional Council shall 
												subject to the provisions of 
												this section conduct its 
												proceedings according to 
												customary law.....&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Customary Law is defined under 
												section 18(1) of the 
												Interpretation Act, 1960 (CA9) 
												as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;18(1) Customary law as 
												comprised in the laws of Ghana 
												consists of rules of law which 
												by custom are applicable to 
												particular communities in Ghana, 
												not being rules included in the 
												common law under any enactment 
												providing for the assimilation 
												of such rules of customary law 
												as are suitable for general 
												application&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												For all we know, Ghana has 
												customary Land law (see 
												Ollennu's book on &#8220;Customary 
												Land Law in Ghana&#8221;). It has 
												customary law of succession or 
												inheritance, marriage and 
												paternity etc. Our law reports 
												are replete with cases decided 
												by native courts and tribunals 
												as well as the regular courts. 
												In all these cases issues or 
												disputes arising between 
												individuals, groups or 
												institutions are resolved and 
												determined upon the basis of 
												evidence led by the parties and 
												their witnesses and at times 
												supported by documents where 
												required or other means. 
												Witnesses are cross-examined and 
												the tribunals or courts evaluate 
												the evidence and give judgments. 
												When therefore an enactment 
												talks of customary law this is 
												the context in which it should 
												be understood. I will illustrate 
												this point by the case of Addae 
												v. Asante [1974] 2 GLR 288 High 
												Court, Sekondi. This was a case 
												on customary arbitration and 
												Edusei J (as he then was) had 
												this to say to P.290:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;It must always be borne in mind 
												that an arbitration is itself an 
												informal proceedings and 
												provided nothing is done that 
												sins against the rules of 
												natural justice, a court should 
												be slow in setting aside an 
												arbitration which was properly 
												conducted and in which all the 
												parties were afforded an 
												opportunity of being heard&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In an old case Okuma v. Tsutu 
												(1944)10 WACA p. 89 at p. 90 
												Graham CJ dilating on fair trial 
												at a native tribunal said:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;In this connection we may quote 
												once more from the judgment of 
												the Privy Council in the case of 
												Nathan v. Bennieh as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Decisions of the Native 
												Tribunal on such matters which 
												are peculiarly within their 
												knowledge arrived at after a 
												fair hearing on relevant 
												evidence should not be disturbed 
												without very clear proof that 
												they are wrong.&#8221; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It follows from leading cases 
												therefore that customary law 
												draws its nerve wire from the 
												most ancient concepts of the 
												rule of law, natural justice and 
												fair trial and we must recognise 
												that our customary law is 
												especially tenacious of the 
												truth and would leave no 
												vestiges of doubt in its pursuit 
												of the truth and it achieves 
												this objective through the 
												investigative process of calling 
												witnesses and subjecting them to 
												the rigours of cross-examination 
												albeit in an informal manner not 
												fettered by any technical rules 
												of evidence as pertain in the 
												common law practice. It is 
												therefore in my view revulsive 
												to customary law to say that it 
												operates on arbitrariness and 
												caprices. In fact it was 
												precisely to safeguard this pure 
												and sacrosanct nature of 
												customary law and its procedure 
												that statutes such as section 28 
												of Act 370 were enacted. 
												Contrary to what counsel may 
												think of customary law, that it 
												operates on no laid down 
												principles such as 
												cross-examination, customary law 
												as indeed Griffith CJ said in 
												Yirenkyi vrs. Akuffo [1905] 1 
												Ren p. 362 at p. 367:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Generally consists of the 
												performance of the reasonable in 
												the special circumstances of the 
												case&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Other cases have approved of and 
												applied this famous dictum which 
												to me is an eloquent testimony 
												of the intrinsic wisdom in our 
												customary law. Some of the cases 
												are Tanor v. Dapomah [1960] GLR 
												354 SC; Prempeh v. Addo [1961] 
												GLR 427; and Adjowei v. Yiadom 
												III and Others [1973] 2 GLR 
												p.90. In the last case Sowah JA 
												(as he then was) said at p.97:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;In our ancient society the 
												presence of independent 
												witnesses in all business 
												dealings was considered 
												essential. It is on the 
												testimony of the independent 
												witness that the elders can 
												verify the truth of such matters 
												as were in dispute. It seems to 
												me reasonable to suppose if in 
												spite of the absence of such 
												witness sufficient evidence 
												could be brought to establish 
												the truth of the matters in 
												dispute, no reasonable group of 
												elders would hold that the 
												matter had not been proved 
												because no witness was present.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It follows from all these cases 
												that any imputation to customary 
												law that it operates on the 
												procedure adopted by the 
												Judicial Committee would be 
												unsupportable by legal history. 
												The truth of the matter is that 
												the committee acted in flagrant 
												defiance of all known rules of 
												practice and procedure under 
												customary law. I must take this 
												opportunity to lament the fact 
												that of late, a tendency on the 
												part of some courts and 
												tribunals to burk out decisions 
												from affidavits by opposing 
												parties even through such 
												affidavits clearly disclose 
												triable issues is rearing its 
												ugly head and the Court of 
												Appeal must register its 
												implacable objection to it. In a 
												recent case The Republic v. 
												Georgina Asare Ex-parte Samuel 
												Kofi Asare and Rev. Augustina 
												Aunn-Yeboah, dated 18th May 2000 
												unreported where the High Court, 
												Accra had given a ruling without 
												taking evidence on the 
												affidavits which raised serious 
												triable issues, the Court of 
												Appeal unanimously allowed the 
												appeal against the judgment 
												convicting the contemnor. In the 
												course of the judgment the Court 
												stated:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;It must be stressed here and 
												now that the only sure and 
												time&#8211;tested means in the hands 
												of a court or a judge is the 
												benefit of observation of the 
												credibility of a witness in the 
												witness-stand. Such evidence 
												unlike an affidavit evidence is 
												tested by cross-examination and 
												the credibility of the witness 
												can be measured by an objective 
												criterion, rather than the 
												idiosyncrasy and prejudice of 
												the judge&#8221; (per Twumasi JA).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Speaking in a conceptual sense, 
												customary law by tradition knows 
												no writing, although in the 
												modern jurisprudential setting 
												there has been some flirtation 
												of customary law with writing 
												and systematic recording of 
												proceeding and documentation in 
												legal proceedings before the 
												customary tribunals.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The instant case demonstrates 
												that they are even venturing 
												into the arena of the practice 
												and procedure strictly reserved 
												to the ordinary law courts. I am 
												alluding to the affidavits. It 
												is in this new frontier that I 
												wish to admonish the customary 
												tribunals that if they adopt any 
												procedure ordinarily reserved 
												for the ordinary courts, then 
												they should be prepared to 
												comply with the requirements. 
												Affidavits can support and form 
												the basis of a judgment only if 
												the deponent has admitted the 
												averment in the opponent&#8217;s 
												affidavit, not otherwise. Where 
												the affidavits disclose triable 
												issues the court or tribunal 
												must call the deponents to 
												answer questions in 
												cross-examination before 
												judgment can be given on the 
												basis of the view taken of the 
												credibility of the parties.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It seems to me that the learned 
												High Court Judge came to the 
												right decision and his ruling 
												cannot be faulted. For this 
												reason I would dismiss the 
												appeal.</span></p>
