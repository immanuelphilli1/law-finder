						<font face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US">This is an appeal 
						from the High Court, Accra where the appellant was on 
						25th September 2008 convicted on two counts of offences 
						related to narcotics. The counts were (1) Attempted 
						exportation of Narcotic Drug without Licence issued by 
						the Ministry of Health and (2) Possession of Narcotic 
						Drug without lawful Authority. Both counts were contrary 
						to Sections 1(1) and 2(1) respectively of the Narcotic 
						Drugs (Control, Enforcement and Sanctions) Law 1990 (PNDCL 
						236). The Court below convicted the appellant and 
						sentenced him to a term of 12 years IHL on each count to 
						run concurrently. this notice of appeal the appellant 
						raised two main grounds of appeal viz that; &quot;1. The 
						Court erred in not considering the defence of the 
						appellant and 2. The Court erred by doing selective 
						consideration of some facts ignoring others.&quot; Under sub 
						items 2(a - d) appellant gave five factual situations he 
						claimed the Court failed to consider. These factual 
						situations were matters that emanated from the evidence 
						led in the trial. Briefly, the Appellant arrived at the 
						Kotoka International Airport on 10th July, 2006 at about 
						7:30 pm to board a KLM flight to Amsterdam. During the 
						pre- departure formalities at the Airport, the appellant 
						was picked at random by an official of the Narcotics 
						Control Board (NACOB) on suspicion of possessing 
						narcotic drug and was taken to 37 Military Hospital for 
						an X-ray examination. The examination however proved 
						negative. Appellant thereafter was taken back to the 
						airport and in the offices of NACOB, a search was 
						conducted on the appellant which included his hand 
						luggage. When a green hand bag which the appellant was 
						holding was searched, four (4) parcels of some whitish 
						substance were found in two false compartments in the 
						bag. There were two parcels of the substance in each 
						compartment. A field test of the substance proved 
						positive for cocaine. For confirmation the suspected 
						cocaine was sent to the Ghana Standards Board for 
						testing. The test proved positive for cocaine with a net 
						weight of 1656.8215 grams. it is important to note that 
						before the green hand bag was eventually sealed the 
						appellant requested that items in the nature of boxer 
						pants, singlets and socks in the bag be released to him 
						for personal use. On these facts the appellant was tried 
						by the High Court which convicted him. Counsel for the 
						appellant argued in his submissions filed in this Court 
						that, the lower Court erred seriously in not giving 
						adequate consideration to the evidence relating to the 
						explanation of the accused. Counsel referred to section 
						13 of the Evidence Act 1975 which explains the position 
						of the law and the standard of proof required for 
						conviction in criminal trials. According to Counsel the 
						term &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; as explained by Lord Denning in 
						the famous case of Miller vs. Minister of Pensions 
						(1947) 2 All ER 372 was not followed because according 
						to Lord Denning. &quot;Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not 
						mean proof beyond a shadow of doubt. The Law would fail 
						to protect the community if it admitted fanciful 
						positions to deflect the course of justice&quot; Counsel 
						argued further that the trial Judge was not fair to the 
						appellant as it appeared to Counsel that the Judge had 
						already made up his mind against the appellant when the 
						trial judge made a finding in the following words that; 
						In his defence, the accused person had given detailed 
						account about the circumstances leading to the arrival 
						of Kenny at the Airport. There has been afew anxious 
						telephone calls between the accused person and Kenny. 
						The anxiety was indeed overwhelming, not the type that 
						would ordinarily be associated with or expected of a 
						really disinterested person as the picture sought to be 
						painted by the accused person would suggest.&quot; Counsel 
						was emphatic that the evidence of the accused never made 
						mention of anxious telephone calls to warrant the 
						conclusion arrived at by the trial Judge. In sum 
						according to Counsel, the conclusion reached by the 
						trial Judge when he assessed the evidence of the 
						appellant was not fair and that was prejudicial to the 
						trial of the appellant. Before we proceed to assess the 
						evidence led at the trial, it will be instructive to 
						comment on the trial judge's summation of what he 
						believed occurred at the airport. A judge is under duty 
						to make comments concerning the conduct of an accused 
						person during a trial. Such comments may directly 
						emanate from the demeanor of a witness when testifying. 
						Indeed the appellant did not directly use the word 
						&quot;anxiety&quot; to describe his mood at the airport when he 
						was expecting Kenny. It is obvious that the trial judge 
						found from the surrounding circumstances that the 
						accused was indeed anxious to meet Kenny at that time. 
						The appellant had given evidence that when he was 
						waiting for Kenny at the airport to bring the bag to 
						him, he and Kenny engaged in telephone conversation when 
						Kenny delayed in coming to the airport with the green 
						hand bag. These are the exact words of the appellant in 
						his evidence in chief: &quot;When I was at the airport, Kenny 
						called me and I told him that I was in the queue 
						checking-in my luggage. He told me to wait because he 
						wanted to be with me a little while. I waited for 
						about30 minutes. He did not turn up and I got back to 
						him on the phone and told him there was no time on my 
						side. He kept on insisting that I should still hold on 
						and he still did not turn up. Within that period, the 
						Airline Counter was about to close for check-in so I had 
						got no other option than to check-in my luggage which I 
						did. About twenty to twenty-five minutes later after I 
						had checked-in my luggage, I had a call from Kenny 
						again. This time around he informed me that he was at 
						the front of the Departure Hall,I told him I had already 
						checked-in my luggage but he told me that it was not 
						something so big, so I went out from the Departure Hall 
						to meet Kenny out there. When I met him I found out that 
						it was indeed a small sports bag. At that point I said 
						that was not going to be a problem because I was only 
						having this small PUMA bag, so I could still carry what 
						Kenny brought as my hand luggage. Marvin being a good 
						friend to me, I took that baggage from Kenny to be 
						delivered to Marvin. We bid good-bye and I went back to 
						the Departure Hall.&quot; Having read the evidence of the 
						appellant concerning the events that occurred before he 
						was given the hand bag, we tend to agree with the trial 
						judge that indeed failure on the part of Kenny to appear 
						at the airport created anxiety which was &quot;overwhelming&quot;. 
						The statement did not reflect a prejudiced mind on the 
						part of the trial judge but a conclusion lie reached 
						based on the evidence before him as narrated by the 
						appellant himself. We do not find that conclusion 
						reached by the trial judge offensive or made to cause 
						injustice to the appellant. In assessing the whole 
						trial, we are left in no doubt that the trial judge 
						correctly advised himself as to the ingredients related 
						to the two counts before him. In respect of count 1, 
						that is, Attempted Exportation of Narcotic Drug without 
						Licence issued by the Minister of Health, evidence was 
						led in our view to establish that what the appellant had 
						in his possession was a narcotic drug; that the 
						appellant attempted to export the narcotic drug on 10th 
						July 2006, through Kotoka International Airport; and 
						that the appellant had no licence issued by the Minister 
						of Health for that purpose.The evidence of the various 
						witnesses, including that of the Principal Scientific 
						Officer who conducted the test on the substance which 
						proved positive for cocaine was sufficiently 
						overwhelming to establish the facts contained in the 
						charge sheet for count 1. In respect of count 2, there 
						was evidence from the record to establish that, the 
						substance found on the appellant on 10th July, 2006 at 
						the Kotoka International Airport was a narcotic drug. It 
						was indeed established as well that the appellant had 
						possession of the said narcotic drug and that he had no 
						lawful authority to possess the drug. In establishing 
						that the appellant was in possession of the drug, the 
						evidence of the prosecution indicated that ,the narcotic 
						drug was found in a green hand bag the appellant was 
						carrying at the Kotoka International Airport iii the 
						course of his journey to Amsterdam. Indeed, there was 
						this piece of overwhelming evidence that should not be 
						overlooked. The evidence of PW4, the Police Investigator 
						was that, when he was in the process of sealing the 
						green bag for examination by the Ghana Standards Board 
						the appellant pleaded with him to be allowed to take 
						some items contained in the green hand bag for his 
						personal use. There was evidence that the appellant took 
						out some &quot;singlets, boxer shorts and socks&quot;. Indeed 
						there was evidence from the appellant himself that 
						before the green hand bag was given to him by Kenny, he 
						had checked-in his luggage. If indeed his luggage had 
						been checked-in, why did his singlets, boxer shorts and 
						socks not go with the luggage but were deposited in a 
						bag belonging to another person? A necessary inference 
						which is not far fetched may lead us to the conclusion 
						that the green bag and its contents belonged to the 
						appellant and not to any other person. Having claimed 
						portions of the contents of the green bag to be his, the 
						appellant cannot deny having knowledge of the presence 
						of cocaine in the hand bag. Indeed the circumstances of 
						this case clearly establish also that the appellant was 
						in constructive and legal possession of the cocaine. The 
						evidence abundantly indicates that appellant was 
						conscious and had knowledge of the existence of the 
						cocaine in the green hand bag which at all material 
						times contained his personal clothing as well. Our law 
						is clear that the gravamen of the offence under section 
						2(1) of PNDCL 236 was possession and not ownership of 
						the drugs... See the dictum of Acquah JA (as he then 
						was) in Osafo Vs The Republic [1993-94] 2 GLR 236.There 
						is evidence that the appellant was not in lawful 
						possession of the cocaine found on him and that he had 
						no authority to possess the substance. Having 
						established these basic facts and ingredients in the 
						charges laid, the appellant as accused was under duty to 
						offer explanation in answer to the charges.The appellant 
						in his defence testified that the green hand bag and its 
						contents including the cocaine did not belong to him. He 
						said the bag was given to him at the airport after he 
						had already checked in his luggage. He named the person 
						who gave the bag to him as one Kenny for onward 
						transmission to one Marvin Asamoah in Holland. The 
						details of how the hand bag came into his hands have 
						already been well articulated in this judgment. To 
						further prove that the green hand bag and its contents 
						did not belong to him he gave the phone number of Kenny 
						to PW1 and PW3 for tracing in order to arrest Kenny who 
						was then at the Tetteh Quarshie Interchange. Of 
						particular interest in this case is the question of 
						illegal possession of narcotic drug. Counsel for the 
						appellant forcefully played on a number of rhetorical 
						questions the trial judge posed in the judgment to 
						assist him determine what amounted to possession. Some 
						of the questions were; when was the cocaine put in the 
						bag? Did Marvin put it in the bag? Did Kenny put the 
						parcel in the bag? Can it be said that accused did not 
						know that cocaine was contained in the bag? To all these 
						questions, Counsel had a simple answer, that is the 
						accused was incapable of answering the questions because 
						the facts were not within his knowledge.In our view 
						those rhetorical questions may appear irrelevant, but 
						the facts disclose that the appellant had in his 
						possession when he was arrested, cocaine cleverly 
						concealed in false compartments of a bag. The Supreme 
						Court summed up the law concerning illegal possession of 
						a narcotic drug in these words; &quot;To prove the charge of 
						illegal possession of a narcotic drug under section 2 of 
						the Narcotic Drug (Control, Enforcement and Sanctions) 
						Law ..... It must be shown that the appellant not only 
						had physical possession but also knowledge of the nature 
						and quality of what was possessed, namely a narcotic 
						drug since physical possession without that requisite 
						knowledge would amount to no offence&quot; See Bonsu Vs The 
						Republic [1989 - 99] SCGLR 115 The trial judge 
						painstakingly considered this principle of law in his 
						judgment and after referring to various authorities on 
						the point, it is our view that he came to the right 
						decision when he stated that the accused person herein 
						cannot claim total ignorance of the quality and nature 
						of the substance he was carrying. We do not find any 
						reason to fault the trial judge on this finding of fact. 
						From the record we are convinced and are left in no 
						doubt that the trial judge considered the defence raised 
						by the accused in every material detail and came to the 
						irrefutable conclusion that the defence was a sham. The 
						trial judge concluded that he found no merit whatsoever 
						in the defence raised by the accused. We have closely 
						and diligently studied the record and do not see any 
						reasons to fault the assessment of the evidence by the 
						trial judge. Counsel's view that the trial judge failed 
						to consider the defence of the accused cannot be tenable 
						in the face of the record. We are of the further view 
						that in the Court below the prosecution proved its case 
						beyond reasonable doubt and we find accordingly that the 
						conviction and sentencing of the appellant was 
						appropriate. For these reasons we dismiss the appeal and 
						affirm the decision of the lower Court. COUNSEL; &#8226;
