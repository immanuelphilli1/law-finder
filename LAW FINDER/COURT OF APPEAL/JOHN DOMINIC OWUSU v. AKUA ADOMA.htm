						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The brief facts of this 
						case are as follows. The defendant is the owner of House 
						No. 30 Block K, Kaasi, Kumasi. The plaintiff claims to 
						have become the new owner thereof by purchase from the 
						defendant at a cost of ¢3.5 million. He says that 
						despite having paid the full purchase price and having 
						moved into occupation, the defendant is refusing to 
						perfect the title to the property for him. It was his 
						assertion that the sale transaction was evidenced in 
						writing executed by both parties, so he considers the 
						defendant's refusal to perfect the title a wrongful act. 
						Hence the reliefs endorsed on his writ, namely:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1. A declaration that 
						by a contract a writing dated and executed by the 
						defendant and the plaintiff in the presence of a common 
						witness on the 6th day of July 1987, all the rights, 
						powers, privileges and interest of the defendant in 
						property Plot No. 30 Block K, Kaasi, Kumasi became 
						vested in the plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2. A declaration that 
						it is wrongful for the defendant to fail, refuse or 
						neglect to perfect the plaintiff's title to the said 
						property Plot No. 30 Block K, Kaasi, Kumasi despite 
						repeated demands by the plaintiff on the defendant so to 
						do.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3. General damages for 
						financial loss and inconvenience suffered by the 
						plaintiff as a result of the defendant's said wrongful 
						failure, refusal, neglect to perfect the plaintiff's 
						title to the said property Plot No. 30 Block K, Kaasi, 
						Kumasi.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">4. An order of specific 
						performance compelling the defendant to do all that is 
						necessary for the perfection of the plaintiff's title to 
						the said property Plot No. 30 Block K, Kaasi, Kumasi.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">5. Any other order or 
						reliefs as this Honourable Court would deem fit to make 
						or give in the interest of equity and justice in this 
						suit.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">For her part the 
						defendant's case was that she agreed to sell the 
						property in question to the plaintiff at a price of ¢4 
						million to be paid within three months lest inflation 
						should whittle down the value of the money. That at the 
						request of the plaintiff she allowed him to give a room 
						in the house to his son. That the plaintiff made 
						payments totalling ¢2.9 million within the first three 
						months of the agreement in 1986 and that was all. The 
						plaintiff refused to pay the balance despite repeated 
						demands. So in 1992 she caused her Solicitor to write to 
						the plaintiff terminating the agreement. Thereafter she 
						refunded the plaintiff's money by cheque and re-sold the 
						house to another person. The plaintiff, however, refused 
						to take back the money paid. She averred that she never 
						executed any deed in respect of this property in favour 
						of the plaintiff so the document pleaded by the 
						plaintiff was fraudulently procured. She therefore 
						counterclaimed for these reliefs:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) A declaration that 
						the contract between plaintiff and defendant for the 
						sale of the premises H/No. K 30 Kaasi, Kumasi has lapsed 
						or fallen through by reason of the failure on the part 
						of the plaintiff to fulfil his part of the agreement.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) A declaration that 
						the alleged deed of assignment executed by the plaintiff 
						and defendant and dated the 6th of July, 1987 was 
						procured in fraud and same is null and void.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) An order for the 
						recovery of possession of portions or part of the said 
						premises House Number K.30 Kaasi-Kumasi now in 
						occupation by the plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d) Such further 
						order(s) as this Honourable Court may deem fit.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The following issues 
						were set down and agreed upon for trial:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">i)&nbsp; Whether or not on 
						6th July 1987 the defendant and the plaintiff entered 
						into a written contract whereby the rights, powers, 
						privileges and interest of the defendant in the property 
						plot no. 30 Block K Kaasi, Kumasi became vested in the 
						plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">ii)&nbsp; Whether or not the 
						defendant by her conduct has failed, refused or 
						neglected to perfect the plaintiff's title to the said 
						property .....................</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">iii)&nbsp; Whether or not 
						the purported assignment/sale of the said property 
						........ by the defendant to Abena Darkowaah on 31st 
						October 1992 was void. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">iv)&nbsp; Whether or not the 
						plaintiff is entitled as against the defendant to an 
						order of specific performance for the perfection of the 
						plaintiff's title to the said property ..............</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">v)&nbsp; Whether or not the 
						plaintiff is entitled to the reliefs he seeks by the 
						writ.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">vi)&nbsp; Whether or not the 
						defendant is entitled to her counterclaim.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">vii)&nbsp; Any other issue 
						raised by the pleadings.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial court made 
						these findings of fact:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">i.&nbsp;&nbsp; The deed of 
						assignment, tendered as Exhibit A, on which the 
						plaintiff relied for his title was not executed by the 
						defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">ii.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiff 
						made ¢2.9 million as part payment of the purchase price 
						of ¢4 million as contended by the defendant, and not 
						¢3.5 million as full payment as contended by the 
						plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">iii.&nbsp;&nbsp; The plaintiff 
						has moved into occupation of the property.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The court also held 
						that time was not of the essence of the contract, and 
						also that the plaintiff was entitled to specific 
						performance.&nbsp; Following these findings and holdings, the 
						trial court upheld Reliefs 2 &amp; 4 endorsed on the writ as 
						well as the second relief of the counter-claim, though 
						the court carefully avoided the use of the word 'fraud' 
						to describe the execution of Exhibit A. Judgment was 
						accordingly entered for the plaintiff.&nbsp; The defendant 
						who was dissatisfied with the court's decision has 
						therefore appealed to this court on these grounds:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1.&nbsp; That the judgment 
						is woefully against the weight of evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2.&nbsp; That the learned 
						High Court Judge erred in law when after finding that 
						Exhibit A was a forgery, she proceeded to decree 
						specific performance to the respondent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A. Ground 1.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Two main arguments were 
						advanced in support, namely: lack of writing and time 
						for performance by the plaintiff. I shall take these 
						seriatim. The requirement for writing was made an issue 
						by the plaintiff himself. Indeed his entire case 
						revolved around what he said was the deed executed by 
						him and the defendant in the presence of Lawyer 
						Poku-Amanfo in the latter's office, in July 1987. The 
						trial Judge found as a fact that this document was not 
						executed by the defendant, despite the evidence by the 
						plaintiff and Lawyer Poku-Amanfo to the contrary. What 
						amazes me is the trial court's total failure to at least 
						comment on what appears to be the contrived and perjured 
						story of the plaintiff and Lawyer Poku-Amanfo in this 
						matter when they lied through their teeth that the 
						defendant had signed this document in their presence and 
						in the Lawyer's office when indeed she had not. Why did 
						they have to lie on such a critical issue as to due 
						execution of a deed of assignment? It was a serious 
						misconduct on the part of the Lawyer which is deprecated 
						in no uncertain terms. Was the resort to this apparent 
						collusion not suggestive that the plaintiff knew he had 
						a bad case for failing to pay for the house in full?&nbsp; 
						Nevertheless let us look at the merits of the case, 
						especially the effect, if any, that the lack of writing 
						has on this matter.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was the plaintiff's 
						case that the agreement was in writing: he never relied 
						on an oral contract, the defendant did. So when the 
						attempt to establish the writing failed for fraud, the 
						plaintiff was left with no evidence to rely upon in 
						discharge of the evidential burden that rested on him, 
						since he could not rely on the weakness in the defence 
						case to establish a case for himself. The plaintiff 
						relied on this document to establish the purchase price, 
						the payment he has made and the change in ownership of 
						the property to him. So when the document failed he was 
						bereft of any evidence to prove these matters. So the 
						writing was a critical piece of material evidence for 
						the plaintiff. Section 1 of the Conveyancing Decree, 
						1973 (N.R.C.D 175) - hereinafter referred to as the 
						Decree -&nbsp; provides that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">'(1) A transfer of an 
						interest in land shall be by writing signed by the 
						person making the transfer or by his agent duly 
						authorised in writing, unless relieved against the need 
						for such a writing by the provisions of section 3.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) A transfer of an 
						interest in land made in a manner other than as provided 
						in this part shall confer no interest on the 
						transferee.'</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">By these provisions, 
						the plaintiff could not claim any interest in the 
						property following the failure of Exhibit A. But he is 
						not without a remedy so long as he can bring himself 
						within the provisos under section 3. However, Counsel 
						for the defendant was of the opinion that since the 
						plaintiff failed to prove the writing his claim should 
						have failed. He referred to the English Statute of 
						Frauds of 1677, which is similar to section 1 of the 
						Decree in its terms and language and has been superseded 
						by the Decree. Counsel explained, in reference to s. 4 
						of the Statute of Frauds, that the person to be charged 
						in this case is the defendant and then submitted that 
						&quot;if therefore the appellant has not signed the 
						memorandum or note then no action shall be brought 
						against the appellant.&quot; He concluded therefore that the 
						trial court, having found Exhibit A was not executed by 
						the defendant and was thus null and void, should have 
						entered judgment for the defendant.&nbsp; For his part, 
						Counsel for the plaintiff said the requirement for 
						writing was uncalled for in this matter since the trial 
						court rightly relied on section 3(2) of the Decree to 
						conclude that a valid contract of sale existed on 
						account of substantial part payment made by the 
						plaintiff who has also exercised acts of ownership over 
						the property. Section 3(2) of the Decree provides that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">'Sections 1 and 2 shall 
						be subject to the rules of equity including the rules 
						relating to unconscionability, fraud, duress and 
						part-performance.'</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The court relied on 
						part-performance to exclude section 1 of the Decree, 
						contrary to the case set up by the plaintiff himself. It 
						is true that sufficient acts of part-performance could 
						be applied to avoid the requirement of writing, but it 
						must be referable to the terms and conditions of the 
						contract. So in our law the requirement of writing is

						long as the party is able to bring himself within 
						section 3 of the Decree.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the purchase price 
						there is sufficient evidence on the record to support a 
						conclusion that it was ¢4 million. There is also 
						sufficient evidence to support a finding that the 
						plaintiff paid only ¢2.9 million out of the agreed 
						purchase price of ¢4 million. There is also sufficient 
						evidence to support a finding that the defendant allowed 
						the plaintiff to move into the house. Infact besides 
						this house matter, there were other dealings between the 
						parties herein, an indication of cordiality between 
						them. The bone of contention is whether time was made an 
						essential part of the contract of sale. I'll refer to 
						the relevant pleadings, evidence as well as the trial 
						court's decision on this issue.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This was introduced by 
						the defendant in her statement of defence in which she 
						made these relevant averments:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3.........the defendant 
						states that sometime in 1986, she .......... arranged to 
						sell the said property to the plaintiff for four million 
						cedis.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">4.........the defendant 
						states that it was agreed between her and the plaintiff 
						that this purchase price of ¢4,000,000.00 be settled 
						within three months owing to the inflationary rate at 
						the time.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">5.&nbsp; The defendant 
						states that the plaintiff rather made piecemeal payments 
						to the tune of ¢2.9 million and then failed to satisfy 
						the payment of the balance on repeated demands and 
						against the terms of the contract of sale.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">By way of reply the 
						plaintiff denied these averments quoted above, thereby 
						putting the defendant to strict proof thereof. In a 
						situation like this, where the plaintiff only entered 
						into bare denial, if the defendant succeeds in leading 
						sufficient admissible, satisfactory evidence the court 
						would be bound to make a finding in her favour, in the 
						absence of any other competing claim or story. Let me go 
						on to examine the evidence adduced at the hearing.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Throughout his evidence 
						in chief the plaintiff said nothing about the time to 
						complete payment for the house. It was when he was 
						questioned during cross-examination that he said no time 
						was fixed for him to complete payment. This is the 
						material evidence of the defendant on this issue:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The agreement was that 
						he was to pay the ¢4 million within 3 months from June, 
						1986. We further agreed that I would acknowledge receipt 
						of the money in the deed of assignment if he was able to 
						finish paying the ¢4 million within the stipulated 
						time.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As to why a specific 
						time was agreed upon, she said it was &quot;because of 
						depreciating value of the cedis.&quot; She went on to say the 
						defendant did not pay within the stipulated time. She 
						stated that the plaintiff made the first of four 
						instalment payments in June 1986 and the last in July 
						1986, all totalling ¢2.9 million. It is significant to 
						note that she was not cross-examined at all on this 
						question of time that the plaintiff was to complete the 
						payment. And this is the relevant evidence of the 
						defendant's mother, Adwoa Mansa (DW1):</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The defendant and I 
						decided to sell the house. The plaintiff offered to buy 
						it. The defendant and I entered into negotiations with 
						the plaintiff and agreed on a purchase price of 
						¢4,000,000.00.&nbsp; The plaintiff was to pay for the house

						<span style="font-family: Arial">depends on the 
						credibility and demeanour of witnesses, this court is 
						not bereft of the power or discretion to reach a 
						different conclusion, if, as stated by Lindley, M.R. in 
						the case of COGHLAND vs. CUMBERLAND (1898) 1 Ch. 704 at 
						page 705 there are &quot;other circumstances, quite apart

						may warrant the Court in differing from the Judge, even

						was able to reach a conclusion different from that of 
						the trial court even though questions of credibility and 
						demeanour were raised in the case of ACOLATSE vs. 
						BULLEY-NEEQUAYE, Civil Appeal No. 14/67, dated 27/1/69, 
						unreported.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Let me now talk about 
						what the trial court said on this question. The trial 
						court said this:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The contract between 
						the parties, according to the defendant, was not reduced 
						into writing.&nbsp; She did not tell the court that the three 
						months given to the plaintiff to pay the purchase price 
						was of the essence. In her statement of defence and in 
						court, she said they agreed that the purchase price 
						should be paid within three months because of the 
						inflationary rate at the time. I do not think by this 
						time was meant to be of the essence. Indeed, the whole 
						of paragraph 4 of the defendant's statement of defence 
						was denied by the plaintiff in his reply. Strangely the 
						matters contained therein were not made issues for trial 
						i.e. the purchase price and the time within which it was 
						to be paid ......... The contract which the defendant 
						purported to rescind was entered into in 1986.&nbsp; It was 
						not until 1992 that even though the balance of the 
						purchase price has remained unpaid, she referred the 
						matter to her lawyer. After about six years, if she 
						wanted to repudiate the contract, she should have given 
						him reasonable notice to pay the balance within a 
						definite time. The new date so fixed becomes then of the 
						essence and the court will not have assisted him if he 
						had failed to pay ...... In Exhibit 1 which the 
						defendant's Solicitor wrote to the plaintiff, no further 
						demand was made for the payment of the balance of the 
						purchase price, if indeed there had been such demands as 
						the defendant told the court.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel for the 
						defendant/appellant addressed on this issue and 
						submitted that the trial court erred when it concluded 
						that time was not of the essence of the agreement. He 
						referred to the following passage from the judgment of 
						the court below: &quot;they agreed that the purchase price 
						should be paid within three months because of the 
						inflationary rate at the time and it did not mean that 
						time became of the essence of the agreement.&quot; Counsel 
						submitted that &quot;this conclusion is . . . .erroneous in 
						that time is inherent in the concept of inflation. 
						Inflation is the behaviour of a currency whereby its 
						value depreciates over time vis-a-vis the purchasing 
						power of that currency. Hence the measurement of the 
						rate of inflation has always been relative to time.&quot; 
						Rather surprising to re-call, Counsel for the respondent 
						did not say anything at all in response to his friend's 
						argument on the time element. And as I shall presently 
						show, both the facts of this case and the legal 
						authorities justify that the question of time be 
						considered by the court in relation to the performance 
						of the contract.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">First of all, the trial 
						court said the defendant did not make time for payment 
						an issue for trial and expressed an opinion that this 
						was strange. I thought this remark was ironic in view of 
						the trial court's own finding that the defendant pleaded 
						the fact that the plaintiff was given three months to 
						pay for the house and also testified on it. The trial 
						court had also said the plaintiff denied this averment 
						in his reply. In practice, once the averment on an issue 
						was denied by the plaintiff in his reply, an issue was 
						joined thereon as I pointed out earlier. Thus even if 
						there was no specific issue set down in the summons for 
						directions, the omnibus clause 'any other issue/s 
						arising on the pleadings' would take care of it. It is 
						equally untenable for the trial court to say that even 
						though defendant pleaded and also testified about time 
						for payment, she did not think that &quot;by this time was 
						meant to be of the essence&quot;. If time was not of the 
						essence then one wonders what purpose the averment and 
						evidence thereon was intended to achieve.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial court's 
						further assertion that the agreement as to the price of 
						the house was not made a triable issue was rather 
						strange in the sense that if that be the case then there 
						was no contract of sale at all; for an agreement as 
						regards the price was a necessary ingredient in giving 
						validity to a sale contract and make same enforceable: 
						see KOGLEX v. KATEFIELD (MRS.) (1998-99) SC GLR 451 at 
						p. 459, per Hayfron-Benjamin, J.S.C. So these two 
						matters, namely, the sale price and time for completion 
						of payment were necessary ingredients for the sale 
						contract. And even if no time was agreed upon the nature 
						of the contract would imply reasonable time into it 
						since the contract could not be expected to run 'ad 
						infinitum.' Be that as it may, the defendant's averments 
						and relief 1 of the counterclaim were clearly referable 
						to the time for payment which she said the plaintiff did 
						not respect. It could be seen that when the defendant 
						claimed in Relief 1 of her counter-claim that the 
						plaintiff had failed to perform his side of the bargain, 
						it was referable to nothing but the failure to pay the 
						purchase price within the stipulated time which the 
						plaintiff denied by his reply.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Let me at this stage 
						refer to two relevant authorities on this question of 
						time both decided by the Supreme Court. First is the 
						case of ATTA and Another vs. ADU (1987-88) 1 G.L.R. 
						233.&nbsp; In that case the defendant agreed to sell her 
						house to the plaintiff because she needed the money to 
						assist her son who was in financial difficulties. The 
						plaintiff defaulted in paying the price as agreed upon, 
						so the defendant re-sold the house to another person. In 
						the meantime the plaintiff had, without the knowledge of 
						the defendant, paid the money into the defendant's bank 
						account outside the agreed period for the payment. So 
						when the defendant told the plaintiff she had re-sold 
						the house the plaintiff brought an action for, inter 
						alia, specific performance of the contract of sale. The 
						defence was that since she had been compelled by her 
						financial circumstances to sell the house, the failure 
						by the plaintiffs to pay within the stipulated period 
						did not entitle them to the equitable remedy of specific 
						performance. Holding that time was not of the essence of 
						the contract, the trial court gave judgment in favour of 
						the plaintiff. The Supreme Court held that time was of 
						the essence of a contract</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) where time was an 
						essential element as distinctly spelt out in the 
						agreement, or</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) where the 
						circumstances clearly indicated that time was of 
						material consequence, or</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) where the nature of 
						the land, in that case a grocery shop, made time an 
						inseparable element; and thereby upheld the defence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The other case is FOFIE 
						vs. ZANYO (1992) 2 G.L.R. 475.&nbsp; In that case the court 
						found that no time was stipulated in the contract of 
						sale, yet the court was able to conclude that time was 
						necessarily an element to be considered. Holding 3 
						states that 'although no time was stipulated by the 
						defendant in the offer letter to the plaintiff for the 
						completion of the contract, time would be held to have 
						been of the essence because (a) the offer letter was 
						emphatic on the defendant's desire to hear from the 
						plaintiff soon; (b) financial difficulties necessitated 
						the defendant's decision to sell the house instead of 
						keeping the lease; and (c) the high rate of inflation in 
						the country was depreciating the value of the cedi while 
						the value of the property kept appreciating.&nbsp; Besides it 
						was not only unreasonable to expect the purchase price 
						of a house to be paid by instalments over a ten-year 
						period but it would also be absurd to expect the 
						defendant to wait for ten years to receive the purchase 
						money which was almost equal to the amount he would have 
						received under the lease for the same period.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial court also 
						said it was for the defendant to give the plaintiff 
						notice to complete payment.&nbsp; That conclusion could only 
						be valid or justified if the defendant unilaterally 
						tried to introduce the element of time into the contract 
						at a later stage, in which case she would be bound to 
						give reasonable notice to the plaintiff to pay up. But 
						the position here is different since the accepted 
						evidence was that time was made an integral term of the 
						contract of sale. But the court realised that even when 
						Exhibit 1 was written in June 1992, the plaintiff's 
						response contained in Exhibit 2 was not that he owed the 
						defendant, but that he had fully paid for the house. So 
						that the plaintiff himself had taken a position whereby 
						he was not entitled to notice. And even if notice was 
						necessary at that point in time as stated by the trial 
						court, it was not until October 1992, some four or more 
						months after Exhibit 1 that the defendant decided to 
						refund the plaintiff's money to him. All this while, the 
						plaintiff had taken the stand that he had fully paid for 
						the house. So that if indeed the plaintiff was mindful 
						of paying, he would have taken the opportunity to do so 
						when the defendant wrote to him that he had defaulted in 
						paying the balance. The position then was that even if 
						the defendant had not insisted on time for completion, 
						she had clearly done so by Exhibit 1. So that the 
						defendant had no option than to terminate the agreement 
						when the plaintiff did not honour the time for payment, 
						and even as at the date of the trial court's judgment 
						the plaintiff had failed to pay.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial court's 
						reference to the fact that the defendant took no step 
						between 1986 and June 1992 when the plaintiff failed to 
						pay is unjustified. The fact that a person sleeps on his 
						right offers a defence in limitation or laches, if 
						applicable, to a claim; but it offers no justification 
						for refusal or failure to pay one's just debt. But no 
						such defence was raised by the plaintiff in answer to 
						the defendant's counter-claim. So it was not right to 
						hold same against the defendant especially as she 
						explained why she did not take any action apart from 
						making demands for the money.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Closely following the 
						foregoing was the trial court's assertion that the 
						defendant did not make a demand for the money. Yet the 
						evidence of the defendant and DW1 on this was not 
						challenged or rebutted in any way so the court was bound 
						to accept it. At any rate none of the parties is saying 
						that a prior demand was a requirement of the contract. 
						Be that as it may, it is the duty of the debtor to seek 
						his creditor and not vice versa, and he also assumes the 
						burden of producing evidence to prove he has discharged 
						his obligations to pay money under the contract. What 
						the trial court failed to appreciate was that the 
						plaintiff did not pay the balance then and even now not 
						because time was not of the essence of the contract but 
						because he sought to defraud the defendant with the 
						assistance of Lawyer Poku-Amanfo that he had paid for 
						the house when in fact he had not. The trial court erred 
						when she held that time was not of the essence of the 
						contract since the facts had been pleaded and testified 
						to without any challenge, and the reason why they agreed 
						on time was also valid in law as decided in the FOFIE v. 
						ZANYO case (supra). Surely six years after time for 
						payment had elapsed, the value of the money was 
						completely lost thereby defeating the very reason why 
						time was made a term of the agreement.&nbsp; On the other 
						hand, the value of the property must have enhanced with 
						the effluxion of time.&nbsp; And it was thus inequitable to 
						insist that the plaintiff should continue to withhold 
						payment whilst at the same time he enjoyed the property. 
						And as said earlier the plaintiff did not just bother to 
						pay up, not even after Exhibit 1 had been served on him, 
						and has not done so to date of the trial court's 
						judgment in July 1996, some ten years after payment had 
						been due. At least it took six solid years for the 
						defendant to act during which time the plaintiff could 
						have paid up if he was so minded. In my view, therefore, 
						the defendant was justified in treating the agreement as 
						terminated.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">B.&nbsp; Ground 2.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel for the 
						appellant's view was that once the trial court found 
						that the document on which the plaintiff relied for his 
						title was a forgery, it ought to have entered judgment 
						against the plaintiff. The case put up by the plaintiff, 
						as earlier stated, was that there was an agreement in 
						writing whereby the title to the property in question 
						was transferred to him by the defendant. It was his case 
						also that the agreed purchase price was ¢3.5 million and 
						that he had fully paid for it. These are contained in 
						paragraph 3 of the statement of claim which is the 
						bedrock of the plaintiff's case and it reads as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff says that 
						on or about 6th of July 1987 the plaintiff entered into 
						an agreement in writing with the defendant whereby the 
						defendant sold her property Plot No. 30 Block K, Kaasi, 
						Kumasi to the plaintiff for the sum of ¢3.5 million as 
						consideration. This selling price has been paid by the 
						plaintiff to the defendant which said payment the 
						defendant acknowledged in the written agreement.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial court found 
						that this document was not executed by the defendant and 
						thus upheld relief 2 of the counter-claim which charges 
						fraud against the plaintiff. The trial court also found 
						as a fact that the plaintiff had not paid ¢3.5 million 
						to the defendant as full purchase price. The court was 
						also unable to find that the purchase price agreed upon 
						was ¢3.5 million; in effect, the crux of the plaintiff's 
						case totally failed. But the court went on to find that 
						there was an oral contract under which the plaintiff was 
						to pay ¢4 million for the house out of which he had paid 
						¢2.9 million. This was precisely the case set up by the 
						defendant. So in effect the court was accepting the 
						defence case, yet it relied on it to give judgment for 
						the plaintiff. The trial court, it seems, set up an 
						entirely different case for the plaintiff from what he 
						himself, before the writ was sued out, as well as in his 
						writ and pleadings, and on top of it all in his evidence 
						to the court, never intended to set up. He did not 
						intend to rely on any oral contract, nor did he intend 
						to rely on part-payment of the purchase price, nor did 
						he intend to rely on a purchase price of ¢4 million.&nbsp; So 
						the trial court after finding that the Exhibit A was 
						procured by fraud should have concluded that the 
						plaintiff had failed to establish his case. For as held 
						in the case of OLOTO v. WILLIAMS (1944) 10 W.A.C.A. 23, 
						a court in entering judgment for a plaintiff has to look 
						at the claim as stated in the writ and statement of 
						claim. So that if the evidence led by the plaintiff does 
						not support the reliefs sought by the endorsement on the 
						writ and his pleadings the court ought to dismiss his 
						action in so far as the burden of proof rests on him. 
						And authorities like DAM v. ADDO and Brothers (1962) 2 
						G.L.R. 200, SC.; ALLOTEY and Others v. QUARCOO (1981) 
						G.L.R. 208 CA. decide that a court must not 'proprio 
						motu' substitute a case, nor accept a case contrary to, 
						or inconsistent with, that which the party himself puts 
						forward whether he be plaintiff or defendant. So in the 
						OLOTO v. WILLIAMS case (supra) the court concluded that 
						when the plaintiff failed to make out his case as 
						pleaded, the trial court ought to have non-suited him. 
						That was when the practice of non-suit was available in 
						the High Court. It was for similar reasons that the 
						Court of Appeal decision in ESSO PETROLEUM CO. LTD. v. 
						SOUTHPORT CORPORATION (1956) A.C. 218 was reversed by 
						the House of Lords. The failure of the plaintiff's 
						attempt to rely on Exhibit A failed along with all the 
						other relevant facts as to purchase price and payments 
						he had made. The defence succeeded in these matters as 
						well as on the question of time for payment, so the 
						defendant and not the plaintiff was entitled to the 
						court's judgment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">However, there was this 
						question of the plaintiff's occupation of the house, 
						which was relied upon as an act of part-performance. Yet 
						we have to consider the circumstances of this case 
						before coming to any such conclusion. In other words it 
						should not be considered in isolation. It is on record 
						that the plaintiff herein was on very good and cordial 
						terms with the defendant and her mother. The defendant's 
						mother even gave him her documents of title to another 
						property to enable him secure a financial facility. The 
						plaintiff also occupies another property belonging to 
						the defendant and her mother. The defendant even gave 
						the plaintiff a power of attorney to represent her in 
						some proceedings to recover certain documents for her. 
						In the fact of such cordiality, one should not be 
						surprised that even though the plaintiff had not fully 
						paid for the house, yet the defendant would allow him to 
						occupy the house as though he was the owner thereof. The 
						defence case which was not challenged was that the 
						receipt for payment would be issued and a document 
						prepared only after full payment. That explains why the 
						plaintiff went the full cycle, albeit through fraudulent 
						means, to secure a document to show that he had fully 
						paid for the house. So that the parties knew that not 
						until full payment had been made, the plaintiff could 
						not become the owner of the property. So his occupation 
						of the house was not in reference to the agreement under 
						which he had not yet become the owner of the property.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Specific performance is 
						an equitable remedy usually given by a court to compel a 
						defendant to perform what he has contracted to do. So 
						the court must look at all the circumstances of the case 
						in exercising this discretion, which he must not do 
						arbitrarily or capriciously. But the mere existence of a 
						valid contract does not per se bring about the court's 
						intervention to grant an order of specific performance. 
						The court must examine matters relating to the conduct 
						of the plaintiff, like delay, acquiescence, breach on 
						his part, or even circumstances outside the contract, 
						all or any of which may render it inequitable to enforce 
						the contract.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this case, the 
						plaintiff failed to pay fully for the house as agreed 
						upon. That notwithstanding, he was allowed to occupy the 
						house. He did not pay heed to their demands on him to 
						pay. He has gone ahead to put in tenants from whom he 
						collects rents and yet still failed to perform his 
						obligation to pay. And when he was written to, he wrote 
						back to say he did not owe the defendant. And to add 
						insult to injury, he used fraudulent means to deprive 
						the defendant of this property by forging her signature 
						on a deed with the aid of a lawyer. Clearly this conduct 
						is not attractive to a court of equity. His hands are 
						dirty. And he has also not performed his side of the 
						bargain, despite benefiting financially from the house 
						through rents. Should a court of equity allow a 
						plaintiff who has failed to pay for the house as 
						stipulated in the agreement and who has enjoyed free 
						occupancy thereof as well as rents, to also have the 
						property on top? I think not. In such circumstances 
						Francois J.S.C. would have said &quot;a court of equity 
						abhors such unjust enrichment.&quot; See page 241 of the ATTA 
						v. ADU case (supra). At the same page this relevant 
						dictum of Alderson B. in HIPWELL v. KNIGHT (1835) 1 Y &amp; 
						Ex. 401 at p. 416 appears: &quot;If, therefore, the thing 
						sold be of greater or less value according to the 
						effluxion of time, it is manifest that time is of the 
						essence of the contract and a stipulation as to time 
						must then be literally complied with in Equity as well 
						as the law.&quot; Thus when his case failed the court was 
						bound to dismiss his claim without invoking the aid of 
						equity which he did not deserve on the facts, the law 
						and circumstances of the case. The appeal will 
						accordingly be allowed. All the judgment and orders of 
						the court below are set aside, except relief (b) of the 
						counter-claim which it found for the defendant. In its 
						place judgment is entered for the defendant on all the 
						reliefs sought in her counter-claim.</span></p>
