												JUDGMENT</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												BROBBEY, J.A:&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is an appeal from the 
												decision of an Accra High Court 
												in which judgment was given in 
												favour of the 
												plaintiff/respondent, 
												hereinafter referred to as the 
												respondent for short.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The facts that gave rise to the 
												litigation were these; the 
												respondent claimed that he 
												acquired the land in dispute 
												from Gomoa Nyanyanor in 1973 and 
												registered it at the Lands 
												Department as No. 1498/1977. 
												After acquiring the land, he 
												entered into possession by 
												constructing chalets on portions 
												of it. The defendant who shall 
												hereafter be referred to as the 
												first appellant claimed that he 
												acquired the land in dispute 
												from the chief of Kokrobite in 
												or about 1974. He added that on 
												enquiring from the Lands 
												Department, he discovered that 
												the land had been registered in 
												the name of the Bortianor stool. 
												He therefore repurchased the 
												land from the Bortianor stool in 
												order, as he put it in his 
												statement of defense, to hedge 
												his title. When the litigation 
												started, Bortianor stool joined 
												as co-defendant. That stool 
												shall hereafter be referred to 
												as the third appellant. It was 
												part of the case of the first 
												appellant that he had authorized 
												the Academy of African Music &amp; 
												Arts Ltd. to undertake a massive 
												development project on the 
												disputed land. The Academy was 
												joined to the suit as the second 
												defendant. That Academy will be 
												referred to as the second 
												appellant. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												At the trial court, the 
												respondent&#8217;s reliefs were for a 
												declaration of title, damages 
												for trespass, recovery of 
												possession and perpetual 
												injunction. Judgment was given 
												in favour of the respondent. 
												Dissatisfied with the judgment, 
												the defendant and co-defendants 
												appealed to this court initially 
												on one omnibus ground that the 
												judgment was against the weight 
												of evidence, after which five 
												additional grounds of appeal 
												were filed on her behalf.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												At the trial court, the 
												respondent based his claim 
												principally on the fact that the 
												Stool Lands Boundary Settlement 
												Commission had conducted some 
												enquiries that were numbered as 
												14/75 and 10/76. The two 
												enquiries formed the basis of 
												another enquiry that was 
												numbered as 2/79 and was 
												tendered as exhibit G. The 
												evidence showed that the Stool 
												Lands Boundary Appeals Tribunal 
												set the decisions in enquiry 
												numbers 14/75 and 10/76 aside in 
												1994 and that was tendered as 
												exhibit I. The trial judge 
												however upheld and applied the 
												decision in inquiry number 2/79 
												for the simple reason that even 
												if the two earlier inquiries had 
												been set aside in exhibit I, 
												that exhibit I did not expressly 
												overrule exhibit G. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												That argument is simply 
												untenable. The trial judge and 
												the parties were all agreeable 
												that the very basis of enquiry 
												number 2/79 was enquiry numbers 
												14/75 and 10/76. In exhibit I, 
												the appellate tribunal 
												specifically</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;set aside the judgment relating 
												to zone one as described above 
												where all the six claimants are 
												claiming boundaries, i.e. the 
												area edged blue claimed by 
												Amanfro, James Town stools and 
												remit the same to the learned 
												Commissioner for retrial.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On receipt of the proceedings 
												after retrial we shall be in a 
												position to deliver the full 
												judgment to cover all the three 
												areas. The appeal is adjourned 
												sine die&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The obvious interpretation that 
												can be given to this passage is 
												that the appellate tribunal had 
												nullified the findings on zone 
												one. The parties in this case 
												are agreeable that zone one 
												covered the lands in respect of 
												which the two inquiries numbered 
												as 14/75 and 10/76 were decided. 
												If the basis of decisions had 
												been nullified, no amount of 
												legal technicality can revive 
												it. It was wrong to insist on 
												applying the decision in inquiry 
												no 2/79 which is a determination 
												of a trial tribunal knowing very 
												well that it has been nullified 
												by the appellate tribunal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial judge based his 
												decision to apply the decision 
												in inquiry no 2/79 on the fact 
												that the appellate tribunal did 
												not directly nullify the 
												decision but did so by 
												implication. The reality of the 
												situation was that by the 
												appellate tribunal&#8217;s decision, 
												the decisions in numbers 14/75 
												and 10/76 had ceased to exist 
												because they had been set aside. 
												Since the two formed the basis 
												of 2/79, there was nothing for 
												that 2/79 to stand on. As 
												Denning L.J put it in MacFoy v. 
												U. A. C. [1962] A.C. 152 </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;You cannot put something on 
												nothing and expect it to stay 
												there. It will collapse&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Indeed, the decision in 2/79 had 
												collapsed and could not be 
												revived and applied merely 
												because the collapse was brought 
												about by implication.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												By the trial judge&#8217;s own 
												analysis, the plaintiff&#8217;s case 
												was in the main based on the 
												decision in 2/79 and since that 
												decision had been nullified the 
												plaintiff&#8217;s case failed and 
												should have been dismissed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The second point that militated 
												against the case of the 
												respondent was this; the 
												plaintiff obtained his land from 
												the Chief of Gomoa Nyanyanor. 
												The principal elders and joint 
												heads of the Abredze family of 
												Gomoa Nyanyanor who claimed to 
												be owners in possession of the 
												disputed lands witnessed the 
												transaction. The indenture that 
												evidenced the transaction was 
												tendered as exhibit A. In 
												exhibit A, the grantors of the 
												plaintiff based their claim to 
												the land by asserting that they&nbsp; 
												&#8220;Became seised absolutely in 
												possession free from all 
												incumbrances of all that piece 
												or parcel of land described in 
												the schedule hereto&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The respondent relied on exhibit 
												A by pleading the contents in 
												paragraphs 3 and 4 of the 
												statement of claim. In the 
												statement of defense of the 
												defendant, the appellants 
												specifically denied those two 
												paragraphs 3 and 4. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the respondent&#8217;s summons for 
												directions, the main issue 
												raised was </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Whether or not the plaintiff is 
												the legitimate and rightful 
												owner of the land in dispute 
												having obtained it from the 
												Abredze family of Gomoa 
												Nyanyanor&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the supplementary summons for 
												direction filed on behalf of the 
												co-defendant, the first issue 
												raised was </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Whether or not the transaction 
												referred to at paragraphs 3 and 
												4 of the statement of claim was 
												null and void and or did not 
												operate to vest&nbsp; title in the 
												land in dispute to the 
												plaintiff&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The reason for citing the 
												pleadings and the summons for 
												directions in extenso is to 
												demonstrate that the respondent 
												could not right from the 
												inception of the litigation have 
												been in any doubt that the claim 
												of his grantors to the disputed 
												land was vehemently being 
												contested by the defendants and 
												co-defendant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In addition to that the 
												respondent was the plaintiff in 
												the case and therefore assumed 
												the onus of proof of his title. 
												The Evidence Decree, 1975(NRCD 
												323), s. 11(1) puts the issue 
												simply thus;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The burden of producing 
												evidence means the obligation of 
												a party to introduce sufficient 
												evidence to avoid a ruling 
												against him on the issue.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The defendants and the 
												co-defendants made no 
												counterclaim. Since the 
												plaintiff claimed the relief of 
												declaration of title to the 
												disputed lands and trespass, he 
												had the onus to lead evidence to 
												avoid a ruling being given 
												against him in respect of those 
												reliefs. It was imperative that 
												the grantors established how 
												they acquired the land because 
												if they had no title to it, they 
												could not logically grant what 
												they themselves did not have to 
												the respondent.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What evidence did he lead in 
												proof of his title? It was only 
												the tendering of exhibit A, the 
												indenture that evidenced the 
												transaction between him and his 
												grantors. The grantors 
												themselves were not called to 
												testify to show how they </span>

												&#8220;Became seised absolutely in 
												possession free from all 
												incumbrances&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Beside exhibit A., the 
												respondent tendered documents 
												that did not answer the 
												all-important question, &#8220;How did 
												the grantors acquire the land 
												they claimed to have been seised 
												absolutely in possession?&#8221; The 
												evidence led in support of the 
												respondent&#8217;s claim never 
												answered that question. Where a 
												party claims title to land and 
												he is challenged, is it enough 
												to tender his registered 
												document without more as proof 
												of his title? In our opinion, 
												the answer is obviously in the 
												negative. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The second issue which arises 
												out of the case is yet another 
												question; If a family claims to 
												be owners in possession of land 
												and that assertion is disputed, 
												is it enough proof to merely 
												issue an indenture to a party to 
												tender it in court as evidence 
												of that ownership or possession 
												without appearing to 
												substantiate that claim? Again 
												the answer should be in the 
												negative. The mere fact that an 
												indenture has been registered 
												does not ipso facto confer title 
												on the grantor or grantee in 
												that indenture. In any case, the 
												well-established rule is that 
												registration does not convey 
												state guaranteed title.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												From his testimony in court, it 
												was evident that the respondent 
												was not a member of the family 
												of the chief of Nyanyanor or the 
												Abredze family. He could not 
												have testified on behalf of that 
												family and he did not claim to 
												have testified on its behalf. 
												The onus was on the family, 
												which asserted ownership and 
												possession to have gone to court 
												to establish that ownership and 
												possession. By failing to do 
												that, the respondent&#8217;s claim to 
												the land in so far as it was 
												based on the claim of the family 
												woefully remained unsupported, 
												unsubstantiated and unproved. 
												The claim therefore failed and 
												should have been dismissed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Legally considered, the family 
												was in the position of essential 
												witness to the respondent; that 
												is to say, the essence of the 
												respondent&#8217;s case being the 
												alleged ownership and possession 
												by the family, that case 
												collapsed when that essence was 
												not established by evidence from 
												the family. The failure to lead 
												evidence on an essential aspect 
												of the respondent&#8217;s case should 
												have led to the dismissal of 
												that case.&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A surveyor who later testified 
												as the court witness led 
												significant evidence. He 
												surveyed the disputed land and 
												its surroundings. In his 
												testimony, he tendered a plan as 
												exhibit H. That exhibit H showed 
												that the disputed land was close 
												to the boundary which separates 
												Central Region from the Greater 
												Accra Region but was situated 
												deeply inside the Greater Accra 
												Region. That fact was not 
												disputed by any of the parties. 
												Secondly, the grantors of the 
												respondent are Fantis from the 
												Central Region while the 
												grantors of the appellant are 
												Gas from the Greater Accra 
												Region. The view is held that 
												such boundaries are political 
												actions and at best delineate 
												cultural or traditional 
												allegiances. Regional boundaries 
												may or may not conclusively 
												settle issues of ownership of 
												lands. But they raise very 
												relevant questions that at the 
												same time cannot be ignored; one 
												such pertinent question is how a 
												person residing in one Region 
												can claim to own land in another 
												Region. In the instant case, the 
												evidence of the DW2, the eldest 
												chief of Kokrobite, indicated 
												without doubt that the lands of 
												the people of Amanfro, Oshieyie, 
												Bortianor and Aflakuie who are 
												all Gas surround the disputed 
												land.&nbsp; The respondent did not 
												challenge that evidence even in 
												cross-examination. Surely, the 
												respondent had the onus to have 
												called his grantors to establish 
												how people residing in the 
												Central Region could own lands 
												almost wholly surrounded by 
												people of different ethnic 
												group, namely Gas.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There is no doubt that people 
												living in border areas may have 
												lands spanning two Regions. 
												However, the instant case is not 
												one involving land starting from 
												one Region and continuously 
												extending to another Region. 
												Rather the disputed land as 
												stated already is situated 
												deeply inside the Greater Accra 
												Region and is surrounded on all 
												of its sides by other lands in 
												that Region. Exhibit H further 
												confirms that fact.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The obvious question that arises 
												to be answered is how Fantis 
												from Central Region can claim to 
												own land situated deeply inside 
												the Greater Accra Region in the 
												absence of any evidence of prior 
												acquisition. That, a fortiori, 
												is the reason why the respondent 
												should have called his grantors 
												to testify to show how they came 
												by the land. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												For the avoidance of doubt, this 
												judgment should not be taken to 
												make any pronouncement that a 
												person from one tribe in one 
												Region cannot own lands in 
												another Region occupied 
												predominantly by people of 
												another tribe. What is being 
												harped upon is the evidence in 
												proof of title to the land being 
												claimed, particularly where 
												traditional evidence is required 
												to establish allodial title.
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel for the respondent made 
												analogies of people owning lands 
												across borders. Parties or 
												witnesses should have put those 
												analogies into the case as 
												evidence so that they could have 
												been cross-examined on them. 
												That was because they were 
												factual situations that could 
												not properly have come from 
												counsel who was not giving 
												evidence. Even if counsel were 
												right, no presumption of 
												regularity could be raised in 
												favour of the Nyanyanor people 
												because being people in one 
												Region claiming land in another 
												Region, their claim was 
												irregular. Again, the onus was 
												on them to have gone to court to 
												show how they could own land 
												situated in a Region different 
												from their own Region.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												For two main reasons, the 
												respondent&#8217;s claims failed and 
												should have been dismissed. 
												These were that inquiry number 
												2/79 on which he based his 
												entire case had collapsed and 
												that meant that his case too 
												collapsed. Secondly he failed to 
												call his grantors whose claim to 
												ownership of the disputed lands 
												the appellants challenged. All 
												the other reliefs sought by the 
												respondent in his writ of 
												summons were based on the claim 
												for declaration of title to the 
												disputed land. Since that title 
												claim had failed, the other 
												claims for damages for trespass, 
												recovery of possession and 
												perpetual injunction similarly 
												failed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The claim of the appellant to 
												the land was initially through 
												the Kokrobite stool and, in the 
												alternative, through the 
												Bortianor stool. In the main, 
												what was led by and on behalf of 
												the defendants was traditional 
												evidence. In the testimony of 
												the first defendant, he referred 
												to the Lanma Hill. That hill is 
												indicated on exhibit H as being 
												situated inside the Greater 
												Accra Region. His testimony was 
												that the significance of the 
												hill lies in the fact that it is 
												a boundary feature. He added 
												that that was where the Gas used 
												to have their military 
												accoutrements. That evidence was 
												not challenged. It confirmed the 
												claim of the appellants that the 
												disputed area could only be 
												considered as Ga area because on 
												exhibit H, the hill is in fact 
												positioned on the western side 
												of the disputed land and inside 
												the Western boundary of the 
												Greater Accra Region.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As already pointed out, Regional 
												boundaries are said to raise 
												allegiances but having regard to 
												the nature of the evidence led 
												in the case, allegiance cannot 
												be said to be irrelevant. This 
												case raises issues similar to 
												those raised in the case of 
												Anomabu Stool v. Acquah and 
												others (1957) 3 WALR 265, P.C. 
												where it was held that </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Although allegiance was not 
												itself the main issue between 
												the parties, it was relevant to 
												that issue. Where the ownership 
												of land is in issue, evidence as 
												to allegiance may therefore, in 
												the absence of other evidence, 
												be sufficient to establish the 
												ownership or attachment of the 
												land,&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the instant case, even if the 
												reference to the Regional 
												boundaries of the Central Region 
												and Greater Accra Region raise 
												issues of allegiance, the 
												allegiance proves ethnic 
												attachment of the land and is 
												further proof of the kind of 
												people who are the probable 
												owners of the land.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In any case, since the 
												appellants did not file any 
												counterclaim, they assumed no 
												special onus of proof. The 
												respondent who applied for 
												specific reliefs had the onus to 
												prove all that he claimed but he 
												failed to do so. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												From the foregoing, it is 
												obvious that the appeal succeeds 
												and is allowed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The judgment given in favour of 
												the respondent is set aside and
