						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The late William Bart-Plange 
						(hereinafter called the deceased) who died in 21:3:87 
						left behind a will, probate of which was taken in May, 
						1987 by the defendants/appellants herein, who are among 
						the children left by the deceased. The 2nd and 3rd 
						plaintiffs/respondent are also children of the deceased. 
						But it is in dispute whether the 1st 
						plaintiff/respondents was ever married to the deceased, 
						and if so whether she was a wife of the deceased at the 
						time of his death. The 2nd plaintiff who was not catered 
						for by the deceased in his will was a student at the 
						time of his father&#8217;s death. The 3rd plaintiff, a cripple 
						and mentally retarded child from birth, was also not 
						catered for, not to mention the 1st plaintiff. Hence 
						this action by the plaintiffs whereby they sought an 
						order to make provision under the Will of the &#8230;&#8230;deceased 
						for the plaintiffs&#8230;&#8230;. for whom the deceased testator 
						made no provision.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Besides this relief, 
						the plaintiffs also averred that the devises made to the 
						2nd defendant under the Will were null and void in so 
						far as the beneficiary was also an attesting witness to 
						the Will. This is contained in paragraph 8 of the 
						statement of claim. This averment was denied and 
						plaintiffs were put to strict proof by the defendants.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was the defence 
						case, as pleaded, that the 1st plaintiff was never 
						married to the deceased, and that she only lived in 
						concubinage with him. In short she was not a wife so as 
						to qualify as a dependant within the meaning of section 
						13 of the Wills Act, 1971 (Act 360) (hereinafter 
						referred to as the Act). It was also contended at the 
						trial that since both the 2nd and 3rd plaintiffs were 
						over 18 years at the time deceased died, they did not 
						qualify as a &#8220;child&#8221; under S. 13(1) of the Wills Act,</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial judge found 
						as a fact that the 1st plaintiff was a wife who was 
						lawfully married by custom to the deceased. The Court 
						upheld the contention that the devises to the 2nd 
						defendant were contrary to S. 3(4) of the Act and thus 
						falls into residue under S.8 (1) of the Act. It also 
						held intestacy under the Intestate Succession Law, 1985 
						(PNDCL 111) applied to the residuary estate. The Court, 
						having found that the 2nd plaintiff was a student and 
						the 3rd plaintiff was physically and mentally 
						handicapped, held they were dependants of the deceased 
						who would suffer hardship if no provision was made for 
						them. So the Court upheld the plaintiff&#8217;s claim and made 
						certain orders in their favour including costs of 
						¢50,000.00.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was against this 
						judgment and the consequential orders that the trial 
						court made that the defendants appealed to this court on 
						these grounds:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">a. That the judgment is 
						against the weight of evidence adduced.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">b. That the learned 
						Acting Judge misdirected herself in law on the provision 
						of section 13 of the Wills Act by taking into 
						consideration matters which should be excluded and by 
						applying the Intestate Succession Law, PNDCL 111 to the 
						action which was not permissible in this case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">c. The learned Acting 
						Judge was biased and thereby failed to exercise her 
						discretion in accordance with judicial principles.
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">d. The costs of ¢50,000 
						awarded to the plaintiffs was excessive and not in 
						accordance with the spirit and letter of section 13 of 
						the Wills Act.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Additional grounds of 
						appeal were filed. I shall take only those grounds 
						argued by Counsel for the appellants.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Ground (a) Counsel&nbsp;&nbsp; 
						for the appellants dwelt largely on the marital 
						relationship that existed between the 1st plaintiff and 
						the deceased. Counsel concedes that they were a married 
						couple for some time but his contention is that events 
						that existed prior to the demise of the testator clearly 
						showed the marriage was at an end. There was 
						unchallenged and unrebutted evidence that the couple 
						were customarily married in 1950. Counsel concedes that 
						no steps were taken &#8220;to formally dissolve the marriage&#8221; 
						but they lived apart without anything to show they were 
						married at all. But in my view, the fact that they could 
						not patch up their differences whilst they lived apart 
						did not mean the marriage was dissolved. It is clear 
						that the 1st plaintiff always cherished the belief the 
						husband would return to the marriage just as he did in 
						1963 or thereabouts after eight year separation. And 
						when the deceased deserted the 1st plaintiff in 1955 he 
						never dissolved&nbsp; the marriage. After eight years he 
						returned to live together with the 1st plaintiff during 
						which period they had about five children before he 
						deserted her again. A line of conduct had been 
						established. Hence the 1st plaintiff&#8217;s hope he would 
						come back to her and that explains the steps she took to 
						bring the husband back, though without success. There 
						was evidence, which was unrebutted, that it was the 
						deceased himself who allowed the 1st plaintiff to go and 
						live in her mother&#8217;s house for some time, except that he 
						would not allow her to return into the matrimonial home 
						for having over stayed. Thus the initial decision for 
						her to stay away from the matrimonial home was mutual. 
						And thus however long that lasted; it did not amount to 
						dissolution of the marriage especially when no steps 
						were taken in that direction. The 1st plaintiff tried to 
						go back to the matrimonial home but the deceased refused 
						her that right for no just reason. In view of his 
						previous conduct, the 1st plaintiff would be justified 
						in waiting for him to return at his pleasure without 
						compromising her status as a person married to the 
						deceased. However long the separation might be, it would 
						not ripen into dissolution of the marriage unless the 
						couple clearly intended it to be so and did acts 
						inconsistent with a marriage relationship, for instance 
						where the woman in particular re-marries or goes to live 
						with another man elsewhere and the husband does not 
						complain. That was not the position here. I therefore 
						agree with the trial court&#8217;s conclusion that the 
						marriage was still subsisting at the time deceased 
						passed away.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Next, Counsel submitted 
						that the plaintiffs were not dependants of the deceased 
						so as to qualify for consideration under S,13(1) of the 
						Act, which provides that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">a. If, upon application 
						being made, not later than three years from the date 
						upon which probate of the will is granted, the High 
						Court is of the opinion that a testator has not made 
						reasonable provision whether during his lifetime or by 
						his will, for the maintenance of any father, mother, 
						spouse or child under 18 years of age of the testator, 
						and that hardship will thereby be caused, the High Court 
						may, taking account of all relevant circumstances, 
						notwithstanding the provision of the will, make 
						reasonable provision for the needs of such father, 
						mother, spouse or child out of the estate of the 
						deceased.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is Counsel&#8217;s 
						submission that to qualify as a dependant, &#8220;the 
						particular individual apart from being either a parent 
						or a child or a spouse must have been dependent 
						substantially on the testator for his sustenance during 
						the lifetime of the testator. The contribution of the 
						testator must be regular and substantial to make an 
						application qualify under section 13 of the Wills Act.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Act does not define 
						when a dependency may arise. But I think it&#8217;d not be 
						wrong to suggest that in the case of a child, if the 
						evidence establishes that he/she relies on his parent, 
						wholly or in part, for his/her means of subsistence, 
						then a dependency will have been established. But in the 
						case of a father or mother of a deceased, the evidence 
						must establish that they were, or either of them was, 
						substantially dependent on the deceased testator. Gifts 
						given to one&#8217;s parent/s occasionally will not qualify 
						the parent/s as dependant/s. In the case of a spouse, I 
						think the court will have to examine the extent of 
						his/her earnings, earning capacity and contribution to 
						the upkeep and maintenance of the other. If the 
						surviving spouse was contributing more than the deceased 
						or ever in equal shares with the deceased, in my view a 
						dependency will not arise.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this case, the 
						evidence was that whilst they lived together, it was the 
						deceased who maintained the 1st plaintiff and the 
						children. When the separation or desertion, if one 
						chooses to call it so, occurred, the deceased did not 
						regularly maintain the 1st plaintiff. However he 
						continued to pay for the 2nd plaintiff&#8217;s education as 
						well as for 3rd plaintiff&#8217;s medication. Besides these, 
						from time to time, as and when the deceased liked, he 
						gave them money through one of their daughters. With 
						these facts, Counsel submission was that the 1st 
						plaintiff was not substantially dependent on the 
						testator. She failed to prove any hardship. Counsel 
						urged the Court to adopt the reasoning in Jelley vs. 
						IIIiffe (1981)2 ALL E.R 29 at p. 36 that the court 
						should compare what each spouse was contributing, and if 
						the applicant was contributing more, or even in equal 
						shares as the testator, then there is no dependency.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this case the 
						evidence is that the deceased wholly maintained the 2nd 
						and 3rd plaintiffs. It was the maintenance allowance to 
						the 1st plaintiff that was irregularly paid. But the 
						evidence on record is that it was the deceased himself 
						who refused to allow the 1st plaintiff to return to the 
						matrimonial home, in other words, he himself created the 
						situation that enabled him to shirk his matrimonial 
						responsibility to the 1st plaintiff. In a situation like 
						this, the law will not permit him to say because he was 
						not maintaining the 1st plaintiff regularly the latter 
						was not a dependant. In the words of Lord Robson in New 
						Monckton Collieries, Ltd. v. Keeling (1911) A.C. 648 at 
						page 662: &#8220;The wife does not necessarily cease to be 
						dependant on the husband simply because the latter 
						refuses to recognise or perform his obligation and 
						succeeds in throwing the burden of her maintenance for 
						the time being on the wife&#8217;s parents or friend, or on 
						the state. They may fulfil the husband&#8217;s duty for him, 
						but the wife&#8217;s legal dependence is still on him and not 
						on them and his death deprives her of the proper stay 
						and support on which alone she is entitled to rely. The 
						circumstances, however, are wholly different where the 
						wife herself has for years clearly asserted and 
						definitely maintained her complete independence of her 
						husband.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my view, the 
						deceased, having created the situation that enabled him 
						to abandon his responsibility in large measure, was not 
						legally absolved. He would be responsible as though the 
						parties were living together. The 1st plaintiff who was 
						a pensioner with no monthly pension and no significant 
						source of income was dependent on the husband, before 
						the separation and I hold he continued to be responsible 
						for her.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Unfortunately, both 2nd 
						and 3rd plaintiffs were more than 18 years old at the 
						time the testator died. And so by S. 13(1) of the Act 
						they do not qualify as dependants, however much pain or 
						grief one has for them, especially the 3rd plaintiff. I 
						say this without relish, but that is what the 
						legislation says, there is no ambiguity about it. The 
						rule is that if the language of a statute is clear, it 
						must be enforced however harsh the result may appear to 
						be. As Tindal C.J. put it in the case of WARBURTON v. 
						LOVELAND (1831)2 D &amp; CL. (H.L.) 480 at p. 489: &#8220;Where 
						the language of an Act is clear and explicit we must 
						give effect to it whatever may be the consequences, for 
						in that case the words of the statute speak the 
						intention of the legislature.&#8221; The law maker clearly 
						intended the natural age of a child to prevail. I 
						believe this case brings to the fore the urgent&nbsp; need to 
						amend this law so that certain handicapped and dependant 
						children, however old they may be, will benefit form 
						their parent&#8217;s estate. But so long as the law stands, 
						the court is bound to give effect to it notwithstanding 
						the apparent hardship it may cause; so the case of Quaye 
						v. Quarcoo (1991)2 GLR 437 was rightly decided by the 
						High Court. However, in this case one even wonders why 
						the 2nd and 3rd plaintiffs have not taken advantage of 
						those properties devised to the 2nd defendant which have 
						fallen into residue in order to claim a share of the 
						estate by virtue of PNDCL 111.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Let me return to the 
						dependency of the 1st defendant. It is an undisputed 
						fact that since the death of the testator the 
						responsibility for the upkeep and maintenance of the 2nd 
						and 3rd plaintiffs has fallen on her, with the help of 
						some family members. It is clear that this is causing 
						hardship to her especially in view of the fact that 3rd 
						plaintiff is permanently incapacitated physically and 
						mentally and has to be on medication throughout his 
						life. These factors will have to be considered in making 
						a reasonable provision to the 1st plaintiff. It is clear 
						that the statue requires that hardships be established 
						by an applicant. As a question of fact hardship, I 
						think, would include any matter of appreciation 
						detriment whether financial, personal, physical, social 
						or otherwise. The peculiar facts of each&nbsp; case will have 
						to be considered.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Ground (b) This ground 
						which was next argued reads: &#8220;That the trial Judge erred 
						when she ordered that all rents obtainable from the 
						house known as number C142/4 Kokomlemle, which was a 
						specific valid devise be applied as to reasonable 
						maintenance of the 1st plaintiff herself, and the 3rd 
						plaintiff&#8212;the cripple son of the testator&#8212; for the rest 
						of their respective natural life when there were 
						sufficient funds in the residue that could be used to 
						give reasonable maintenance to 1st and 3rd plaintiffs.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I&#8217;ll first refer to the 
						trial court&#8217;s findings and then the orders that were 
						made to see whether the orders are supportable in law. 
						The court said: &#8220;Having declared that the beneficial 
						disposition in paragraphs 2(b) and 2(c) of the Will of 
						the late, William Bart-Plange are void, and have 
						therefore lapsed into residue under section 3(4) of the 
						&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Act&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..the Court hereby further declares that the 
						plaintiffs are entitled to the enjoyment of these 
						dispositions together with the defendants and others in 
						accordance with the provision of section 2(2) of PNDC 
						Law 111. I therefore order that a refund of all expenses 
						and education of the 2nd plaintiff in Vocational School 
						into which the testator put her before his death be 
						borne by the estate of the testator.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In respect of the 3rd 
						plaintiff, the Court considered his physical and mental 
						disablilities from birth, and related matters and 
						expenses and ordered that &#8220;under the provision of 
						section 13(1) of the Wills Act, 1971&#8230;&#8230;all the rents 
						obtainable from the house known as No. 142/4 Kokomlemle 
						be paid over to the Chief Registrar of the Court as 
						Trustee, for the reasonable maintenance of the 1st 
						plaintiff herself and the 3rd plaintiff&#8230;&#8230;..for the rest 
						of their respective natural lives.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This property, No 
						C.142/4 Kokomlemle was specifically devised to the 1st 
						defendant, which devise was held valid by the Court. It 
						was the appellants&#8217; Counsel&#8217;s view that in view of the 
						fact that some of the devised properties had lapsed and 
						fallen into residue, the trial court ought to have made 
						the awards from the residue. He cited for his support 
						the High Court case of IN RE ALLOTEY (decd.), ALLOTEY 
						and Another v. OTOO and another (1981) GLR 393. That 
						decision followed the English case of IN RE SIMSON 
						(decd.), SIMON v. NATIONAL PROVINCIAL BANK LTD. (1950) 1 
						ch 38 where the court held that &#8220;in a situation where 
						the court considered to make provision to dependants of 
						a testator, the residue is the normal and obvious place 
						from which provision is made&#8221;. But the court did not 
						hesitate to point out that it is not a rule of law, it 
						was only a practice that was being followed by the 
						courts. So it is only an ideal situation to follow by 
						applying the residue to such payments, as the High Court 
						did in case (supra) rightly stated. There is no such 
						specific law in place that an award under S. 13 of the 
						Act must be made from the residue, if any. Indeed it 
						becomes a charge on the entire estate of the testator. 
						But the court, in its avowed aim of doing what is 
						reasonable and just in the circumstances of any case, 
						would not deprive specific legatees or beneficiaries 
						some other property or fund which could be applied to 
						satisfy an award made under section 13(1) of the Act. So 
						in my view since some of the properties have fallen into 
						residue, it is those ones which must first be applied to 
						satisfy the award. Again, since there is no residuary 
						clause in the Will, it follows that the residuary 
						properties have fallen under intestacy to be distributed 
						in accordance with the provisions of PNDCL 111. Thus it 
						could not be said now that the testator has not catered 
						for the plaintiffs. I would think therefore that since 
						the plaintiffs, among other persons including the 
						defendants, have a share in the residuary estate by law, 
						the court would have to determine whether their share 
						would be sufficient to satisfy the genuine and 
						reasonable needs of the plaintiffs. If it would, then 
						the matter should rest there. If not, then the testator 
						would be said to have made no reasonable provision for 
						them within the meaning of S. 13(1) of the Act. In such 
						a situation, the Court would be justified in making 
						provision from the specific devise/s.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my view, therefore, 
						the trial court having found that some of the properties 
						devised by the testator had become void and thus fallen 
						into residue and had become subject to PNDCL 111, the 
						order to pay compensation to the plaintiffs should have 
						fallen on the residue, to begin with. It was not right 
						in the circumstances to side-step the residuary estate 
						in which plaintiffs have a legal right, and attach the 
						specific property devised to the 1st defendant. To this 
						extent only I&#8217;d allow the appeal which otherwise I 
						dismiss.</span></p>

						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is an appeal 
						against the judgment of the High Court, Accra, delivered 
						on the 24th March 1989 by the which the trial judge 
						ordered that all rents accruing from a house which a 
						testator had devised to his favourite daughter be 
						appropriated as 'reasonable provision' for the 1st and 
						3rd&nbsp; plaintiffs because testator has made no provision 
						for them in his will. The 1st&nbsp; plaintiff was the wife of 
						the testator. The 3rd was a son to the testator. The 
						defendants were his daughters who benefited under the 
						will. As the facts of the case unfold it would be found 
						that specific bequests were made but some were by law 
						rendered void and fell into residue.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The house affected by 
						the court's order did not suffer the fate of falling 
						into the residue. The 1st and 2nd defendants being 
						aggrieved by this order have appealed to this court. 
						Four grounds of appeal were filed on the 4th July 1989 
						and on the 30th June 1999 an additional ground was 
						filed. Going by the written submissions, however, only 
						two of the grounds survived the hearing of the appeal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">They were:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">a.&nbsp; That the judgment 
						is against the weight of the evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">b. That the trial Judge 
						erred when she ordered that all rents obtainable from 
						the house known as house number C. 142/4 Kokomlemle 
						which was specific valid device be applied as to 
						reasonable maintenance of the 1st Plaintiff herself and 
						the 3rd plaintiff, the cripple son of the&nbsp; testator, for 
						the rest of their respective natural life when there

						plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The pith of the 
						submission by Counsel for the defendants was, as far as 
						the 1st plaintiff was concerned, that although the 
						testator conceded her status as a wife, she had been 
						guilty of desertion for ten years and consequently had 
						by her own conduct terminated the marriage.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The facts of the case 
						showed that a man by the name William Bart-Plange died 
						on the 21st&nbsp; March 1987 in Accra survived by seven 
						children. A woman by the name Beatrice Akweley Quaynor 
						bore him four out of the seven children. In fact the 
						said Beatrice bore him seven children but three out of 
						the lot predeceased him. The surviving children by 
						Beatrice were: Peter Bart-Plange, James Kpakpo 
						Bart-Plange, Mary Bart-Plange and Grace Bart-Plange.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The three other 
						surviving children were: Mrs. Humphrey Bonsu, Janet 
						Bart-Plange and William Allottey Bart-Plange. By all 
						accounts this man was an accomplished businessman in the 
						well-known 'Contractor&#8217; business in this country. In 
						terms of material wealth he could boast of not less than 
						four self-acquired houses all constructed in the city of 
						Accra. The evidence on record further showed that the 
						death of William Bart-Plange was preceded by a 
						protracted terminal ailment which necessitated 
						hospitalization. But despite this calamity which all we 
						mortals are heir to, William enjoyed the requisite 
						degree of physical and mental capacities which enabled 
						him to contemplate to and in deed did distribute his 
						worldly possessions by a testamentary disposition&#8212;a 
						Will. The&nbsp; highlights of the Will make interesting 
						reading but at the same time teach significant moral 
						lessons.&nbsp; The testator gave two of the houses No. 
						C.502/1A Nsawam road Accra and No. 142/4 Kokomlemle 
						Accra to a most-favoured daughter, Mrs. Agnes 
						Humphrey-Bonsu and explained that that daughter had 
						satisfactorily fulfilled her filial obligations to him. 
						Next he devised House No. 444/4, Accra New Town and a 
						share in, and absolute control of house No. 348/1A&nbsp; 
						Korle Gonno, Accra, to another loving daughter, Janet 
						Bart-Plange. These beneficiaries were children born to 
						the testator by women other than Beatrice Akweley 
						Quaynor. The testator then in exercise of his 
						prerogative invested Janet with the power to give quit 
						orders to any of the surviving children or other 
						occupants of the said house if any of them misbehaved 
						and in his own words in the Will &quot;especially William 
						Bart-Plange who drinks like a fish and does what he 
						likes&quot;. This order was issued by the testator after 
						stating that he had .given the house to Janet and the 
						other children Robert Allotey Bart-Plange and William 
						Bart-Plange. Fortunately or unfortunately for the 
						testator or the beneficiaries, however, these 
						dispositions were foredoomed to failure for they 
						contravened the provisions of section 3(4) of the Wills 
						Act, 1971 (Act 360). The testator so much loved and 
						trusted Janet that he asked her to attest the execution 
						of the Will, contrary to the statutory mandatory 
						injunction under section 3(4) of the Wills Act which 
						provides that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3(4) Any beneficial 
						disposition of or affecting any property other than 
						charges or directions for the payment of any debt, given 
						by a will to a person who attests the execution of that 
						will, shall be void unless the will is duly executed 
						without his attestation and without that of any other 
						such person.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">For the validity of a 
						will section 2(3) of the Wills Act, 1971 (Act 360) 
						insists upon a minimum of two attesting witnesses. They 
						could be more in which case, as the Court of Appeal held 
						in Norga v. Kadjijatu (1984-86) 1 GLR 443 (holding 2), 
						where there were more than two witnesses and the 
						attestation of one happened to be defective whereas the 
						other two remained valid the will was valid. Whether my 
						view of this case is right or wrong is inconsequential 
						because in the instant case only Janet and one other 
						signed the will. What made the disposition a forlorn 
						hope is that it is not an example of a disposition of a 
						charge or direction given to Janet to pay any debt. The 
						disposition to Janet therefore became void ex vigore 
						legis and by virtue of the provisions of section 8 (1) 
						of the Wills Act, 1971 (Act 360) the affected properties 
						fell into residue and since the testator did not 
						incorporate a residuary clause to cater for such 
						eventuality the properties fell into intestacy to be 
						governed by the Intestate Succession Law 1985 (PNDCL 
						111). In such a case the executors appointed under the 
						will are treated as trustees charged with the 
						responsibility of distributing the said properties under 
						the aforementioned law: see Afanie II v. Quarcoo (1992) 
						2 GLR 561 approving the case Re Skeats, Thain v. Gibbs 
						(1936) 2 ALL ER 298.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This case law finds 
						statutory backing right within the Wills Act, 1971 (Act 
						360) itself under section 7(6) of which it is provided 
						that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;7(6) residuary 
						disposition shall include property comprised in lapsed 
						and void dispositions, unless a contrary intention 
						appears from the will&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plain meaning of 
						this provision insofar as it affects the instant case is 
						that, a void or lapsed disposition falls into intestancy 
						where the will does not contain a residuary clause. I 
						would revisit this issue in due course. In the meantime 
						I would proceed with the factual analysis of the case 
						before the trial court. As I&nbsp; have already hinted in the 
						introductory of this judgment Beatrice Akweley&nbsp; Quaynor 
						and all her four surviving children namely were 
						callously rebuffed and disowned by the testator. So 
						implacable was the testator's disgust for Beatrice and 
						these children of his that not even the misfortune of 
						James Kpakpo Bart-Plange being mentally and physically 
						disabled could assuage his bitter aversion. In his will 
						tendered as Exhibit A the testator referred to somebody 
						as his ex-wife:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is stated therein as 
						follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;In making this will I 
						do not want any quarrel or misunderstanding between my 
						children and my ex-wife or my family, generally&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">That word 'ex-wife' was 
						an apparent reference to Beatrice Akweley Quaynor the 
						1st plaintiff. Predictably enough, this naked act of 
						discrimination inflicted upon the children of Beatrice 
						Akweley Quaynor jointly with her children triggered off 
						this litigation. Obviously, the testator harboured the 
						ill-intention to vent his anger upon the children and 
						their mother. This explains why on the 9th&nbsp; September 
						1987 the plaintiffs caused a writ of summons to be 
						issued claiming the following relief:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;An order to make 
						provision under the will of the late William Bart-Plange 
						(deceased) for the plaintiffs as the wife and children 
						respectively of the deceased and for whom the deceased 
						testator made no provision.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The action was 
						instituted against Mrs. Bonsu as 1st&nbsp; defendant and 
						Janet Bart-Plange as 2nd&nbsp; defendant. It was a joint 
						action by Beatrice Akweley Quaynor as 1st plaintiff, 
						Grace Bart-Plange as 2nd plaintiff and James Kpakpo 
						Bart-Plange as the 3rd (with the 1st&nbsp; plaintiff as his 
						next friend). They invoked the provisions of section 
						13(1) of the Wills Act, 1971 (Act 360) which provides 
						that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;13(1) if upon an 
						application being made, not later than three years from 
						the date upon which probate of the will is granted, the 
						High Court is of the opinion that a testator has not

						by his will, for the maintenance of any father, mother, 
						spouse or child under 18 years of age of the testator, 
						and that hardship will thereby be caused, the High Court 
						may, taking account of all relevant circumstances, 
						notwithstanding the provisions of the will, make 
						reasonable provision for the needs of such father, 
						mother, spouse or child out of the estate of the 
						deceased.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2)&nbsp; payment of a lump

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b)&nbsp; grant of an estate 
						or interest in immovable property for life or any lesser 
						period.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In their statement of 
						claim the 1st plaintiff claimed to be the surviving 
						widow of the testator. This claim was denied by the 
						defendants who averred in their statement of defense 
						that the 1st plaintiff could not claim the status of a 
						wife because, as they contended, she was a concubine to 
						the testator. At the trial, however, the defendants when 
						confronted with overwhelming evidence which tended to 
						establish a lawful customary marriage between the 1st 
						plaintiff and the testator, shifted their position by an 
						allegation that the 1st plaintiff led evidence to prove 
						that the late William Bart-Plange married her under the 
						customary law way back in 1950 and that her marital 
						status remained unchanged ever since till the death of 
						William Bart-Plange. She admitted that the marriage life 
						was not trouble free throughout the period because she 
						could recall a period of bitter misunderstanding between 
						the couple which threatened the very foundation of the 
						marriage but those gloomy clouds were weathered away by 
						the intervention of their respective families. On a 
						second sinister event the late William had grown so 
						incensed and angered by the fact that Beatrice had 
						overstayed permission granted her to attend to her late 
						mother&#8217;s funeral.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">William therefore 
						rebuffed Beatrice and would not like to see her any 
						longer despite all entreaties by Beatrice&#8217;s family. The 
						result was that for a period of ten years the couple 
						never co-habited. Nevertheless, there was unchallenged 
						evidence that the 1st plaintiff performed customary 
						rites assigned to widows upon the death of William 
						Bart-Plange. The learned trial judge accepted the 
						evidence and found that a valid customary marriage 
						subsisted between the late William Bart-Plange and the 
						1st plaintiff Beatrice, and cited the case of Asumah v. 
						Khair (1959) GLR 353 CA. This famous case decided by the 
						Court of Appeal and other numerous subsequent cases 
						including Quartey v. Martey (1959) GLR (Part II) 573 and 
						Re Sakitey&#8217;s Caveat (1962) 1 GRL 180 recognise the 
						existence of a valid customary marriage between a man 
						and a woman where it is proved that the man or his 
						family asked of the hand of the woman in marriage and 
						the request was accepted by evidence that the woman&#8217;s 
						family received gifts or drinks and money from the man&#8217;s 
						side; that even in certain cases a marriage is deemed to 
						have been in existence between a man and a woman if it 
						is established that upon the death of the man the woman 
						was permitted by the deceased&#8217;s family to attend the 
						funeral and she in fact performed the funeral rites 
						assigned only to surviving widows. The learned trial 
						judge preferred the 1st plaintiff&#8217;s version of the 
						controversy and found that the 1st plaintiff was 
						lawfully married to the testator at the time of the 
						latter&#8217;s death. Her findings on the facts were amply 
						supported by the unchallenged evidence on record. It 
						must be stressed that a strong prima facie case made by 
						a plaintiff, as it is in the instant case, cannot be 
						dislodged by the inconsistent defense put up by the 
						defendants, namely, shifting their case from the 
						concubinage to desertion:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">See Odametey v. Cloucuh 
						and Another (1989-90) 1 GLR 14 SC. The testator 
						erroneously thought that the 1st plaintiff was no longer 
						his wife because of the long period of separation but 
						his family proved him wrong by allowing the woman to 
						perform customary rite assigned to widows. In my view 
						the testator was rather guilty of constructive 
						desertion. The learned judge therefore correctly applied 
						the cases of Hughes v. Hughes (1973) 2 GLR 342 and 
						Caveat By Clara Sackitey (1962) 1 GLR 180 on the legal 
						effect of separation that it does not constitute 
						dissolution though it may be a prelude to it. I need not 
						catalogue legal authorities to drive home the point that 
						there are special customary rites essential for the 
						valid dissolution of a customary marriage. The general 
						rule is the family of the woman must return to the 
						husband&#8217;s family something to symbolise the dissolution. 
						The custom differs from one ethnic group to the other in 
						the country. For example among the Frafras of Northern 
						Ghana it requires the return of &#8220;calabash&#8221; by the 
						woman&#8217;s family to the man: See Ginobuuro v. Kaba (1971) 
						2 GLR 416, and among the Akans the return of the &#8220;Tsir 
						Nsa&#8221; see Atta v. Annan (1975) 1 GLR 366. Counsel for the 
						defendants conceded that there was no evidence to 
						suggest that the testator himself took steps to formally 
						dissolve the marriage even though they were separated 
						for ten years before the testator breathed his last. As 
						counsel for the 1st plaintiff rightly responded, the 1st 
						plaintiff in the eyes of the law remained the wife of 
						the testator and this supported by case law: see Re 
						Caveat By Clara Sackitey (supra). There was unchallenged 
						evidence that attempts by the families of the parties at 
						reconciliation proved unsuccessful due to the testator&#8217;s 
						refusal to forgive the wife for overstaying the 
						permission given to her to attend her mother&#8217;s funeral. 
						There was no evidence that the 1st plaintiff remarried 
						during the period of separation but it is on record that 
						the testator had other women at his disposal who had 
						born him the other beneficiaries of his will. The 
						following extract from the cross-examination of 1st 
						plaintiff at page 36 of the record was interesting but 
						revealing.</span></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">From the foregoing it 
						is clear that Counsel for the 1st plaintiff was 
						unquestionably right when he apportioned total blame to 
						the testator for the ten years separation. In Beckley v. 
						Beckley (1974) 1 GLR 393 Abban J (as he then was) held 
						that even where it where it was doubtful as to which of 
						the parties was guilty of separation, the law imposed a 
						duty upon the husband to continue with the maintenance 
						of the wife. This decision applied with even greater 
						force to the instant case. In his book &#8220;Law Of Testate 
						And Intestate Succession In Ghana&#8221; 1st edition P.225 the 
						learned author Justice Ollennu (of blessed memory) said:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220; So great is the 
						importance which customary law attaches to a man&#8217;s 
						liability to maintain his wife that his failure to 
						maintain her is one of the very few grounds upon which a 
						wife obtain divorce&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221; (See Sarbah Fanti Customary Law 
						(1897) 44-45; D.A.L.C. pp 156-158. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my view it is 
						precisely this customary rule of law to which the Wills 
						Act 1971 (Act 360) provides a much-needed statutory 
						backing under section 13(1). The principle is equally 
						applicable to Gas: See &#8220;Social Organisation Of&nbsp; The Ga 
						People&#8221; by Field pages 54-57. This legal responsibility 
						of a husband spans the entire lifetime of the woman. It 
						implies that the man must discharge this responsibility 
						either during his lifetime or after his death by his 
						will. My view of the law is that a man may do something 
						specially contingent e.g. establish a business for the 
						wife on the understanding that she maintain herself out 
						of the proceeds of the business or make a gift of some 
						property to his wife in similar vein. The question which 
						a court ought to pose when faced with any proceeding 
						under section 13(1) of Act 360 is: What provision for 
						the maintenance of his wife did the man make either 
						during his lifetime or by his will. If the court is 
						satisfied having regard to all the circumstances 
						including the financial standing in terms of property or 
						otherwise and the condition of the wife that the man did 
						make reasonable provision then, any application under 
						section 13(1) must be refused otherwise it must be 
						granted. If on the other hand the man maintained his 
						wife by reasonable payments of cash or goods in 
						installments during his lifetime then, in such case, he 
						is required to make reasonable provision in his will to 
						cater for continued payments out of his estate. The 
						instant case falls under the later category. The other 
						considerations that ought to be taken into account are a 
						(a) the needs of the 1st plaintiff (b) that hardship 
						would be caused to her if reasonable provision was 
						refused. The evidence on record was that since 1980 when 
						the 1st plaintiff received the sum of ¢12,000 as pension 
						and gratuity from her employers she never received any 
						monthly pension payments. It seems to me unquestionable 
						that the learned judge had before her sufficient 
						evidence to defend the exercise of her discretion in 
						favour of the 1st plaintiff that she was entitled to a 
						reasonable provision from the estate the testator. On 
						this issue I would apply the same test which Morton J 
						suggested in the English case of Restyler 1942 Ch 387 at 
						389 cited by Counsel for the appellant where the learned 
						judge said:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;I think that the court 
						has to find it was unreasonable on the part of the 
						testator to make no provision for the person in 
						question&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This test was applied 
						in other English cases such as Re Pugh (1943) C 387 at 
						385. Re Inns (1947) 576 at 580-581 and Re Franks (1948) 
						Ch 62 at 64-65. These cases were cited by Counsel for 
						the appellant to assist the court and I found them 
						useful and feel grateful. Another case he cited which 
						again did not benefit him but assisted the court was the 
						English case of Jelley v Illife (1981) 2 All ER 29 where 
						the English Court of Appeal laid another test which in 
						its true perspective implied that the court in 
						determining the question of whether a spouse was a 
						dependant, the test was to ascertain the contributions 
						which each spouse made to the family budget and to 
						decide which of them weighed heavier than the other. In 
						this court one can think of a situation both spouses may 
						belong to the same lucrative profession. But the case 
						before this court does not pose this 
						contribution-balancing test. The relationship between 
						William Bart-Plange and the 1st plaintiff was that of a 
						prosperous businessman and a meager paid public servant 
						who eked out a living. The plight of low-income publish 
						servants of this country is a matter judicially noticed. 
						The scales therefore favour the 1st plaintiff even by 
						English case law test. But looking at our own situation, 
						our Wills Act 1971 (Act 360) section 13(1) gives the 
						court a very wide room to maneuver its discretion. One 
						important and relevant fact which weighed heavily on the 
						mind of the trial judge and rightly in my view was that 
						in his lifetime the testator himself realised that the 
						plaintiffs needed his help in their maintenance and in 
						fact he was doing something about it by way of 
						remittances except that they were irregular and 
						inadequate. There was therefore no reason why in his 
						will the testator on the false contention made by him 
						that the 1st plaintiff was no longer his wife he denied 
						her reasonable provision. Also important was the 
						unchallenged evidence by the 1st plaintiff that at the 
						inception of their marriage the testator had only one 
						house but he added three in quick succession to make 
						four while she also worked hard to bear him as many as 
						seven children. Ironically non of these facts did win 
						the sympathy of the testator to leave something for the 
						1st plaintiff. The trial judge was perfectly right in 
						interfering with the will.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The curtain now turns 
						on the 2nd plaintiff. There was unchallenged evidence 
						that the testator maintained and sponsored her at a 
						vocational school. The 1st plaintiff however claimed 
						that she continued with the maintenance and educational 
						sponsorship of the 2nd plaintiff after the death of the 
						testator. The learned trial judge therefore ordered that 
						the 1st plaintiff out of the estate of the testator In 
						fact by their statement of defense the defendants 
						admitted by their paragraph 13 thereof that their 
						deceased father maintained and looked after the 2nd and 
						3rd plaintiffs even during the period of separation of 
						their parents. The question obviously arises as to 
						whether arrears of maintenance of children are 
						recoverable. On this question I have studied two decided 
						cases of the High Court. The first is Sekyere vrs. 
						Hanson alias Akua Mercy (1974) 1 GLR 56 where the High 
						Court, Accra held that under section 8 of the 
						Maintenance of Children Act, 1965 (Act 297) such arrears 
						were not recoverable. The court held that the enactment 
						contemplated future, not past expenses in the form of 
						maintenance. In the second case Amartey v. Sraha (1976) 
						1 GLR 279 it was held also by the High Court Accra 
						differently constituted that under the said section 8 of 
						Act 279, arrears of maintenance were recoverable 
						provided there was proof of such expenses having been 
						made on a child. The Maintenance Of Children Act 1965 
						(Act 297) was repealed by The Maintenance Of Children 
						Decree, 1977 (SMCD 133) but the Decree retained the 
						provisions of section 8 of the Act under Part 2 thereof. 
						The decision in Amartey&#8217;s case, unlike the earlier case, 
						took cognizance of the obligation under customary law 
						that lay upon a man to maintain his child from birth to 
						the age of 21 as explained in numerous cases: See 
						Sirebour v. Dome (1962) GLR 82.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">An important canon of 
						statutory construction is that it must take account of 
						existing laws especially the customary law on the 
						subject. However, whatever may be the desirability the 
						opinion of this court on this vexed question of law on 
						the status of arrears of maintenance raised by the two 
						seemingly conflicting views of the High Court, this 
						court is precluded from doing so simply because that 
						issue has not be raised in this appeal as the defendants 
						did not appeal against the order of the trial court and 
						I prefer to leave the point open. The claim of the 3rd 
						plaintiff provided the clearest archetype of the moral 
						dimension in exercise of judicial discretion. This 
						plaintiff suffers mental and physical disability from 
						birth yet strict compliance with the letter of section 
						13 (1) of the Will Act 1972 (Act 360) disqualifies him 
						from applying for a reasonable provision because the 
						statute covers children under 18 years of age which he 
						had passed at the date of the will. As Ampiah J (as he 
						then was) held in Quaye v. Quarcoo (1991) 2 GLR 437 even 
						though there was no age limit to a father, mother or 
						spouse who could apply for a reasonable provision under 
						section 13(1) of the Wills Act, 1971 (Act 360) such 
						limitation existed to a child and any one above eighteen 
						could not benefit. Counsel for the defendants relied on 
						this case and re-inforced his argument by quoting from a 
						passage in the recent book &#8220;The Law of Wills&#8221; by the 
						Hon. Justice Azu-Crabbe ex-Chief Justice of Ghana at 
						page 111: as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Unfortunately, the Act 
						makes no provision for a child who though above the age 
						of 18 years, is by reason of physical or mental 
						disability, incapable of maintaining himself or herself. 
						Nor does the Act make any provision directed towards 
						alleviating the hardship of a child who is above the age 
						of 18. In these circumstance the court is powerless, and 
						it cannot make any order of relief&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the course of his 
						argument, however, Counsel apparently by a prick of 
						sympathy for the poor child softened his stance and 
						caved in to some undercurrent moral pressure by urging 
						upon this court to exercise its discretion in favour of 
						the said child despite the appeal, thus by necessary 
						implication abandoning the appeal on that score. The 
						learned trial judge for her part took a divergent 
						approach by arguing that a child in the predicament the 
						3rd plaintiff who was mentally and physically 
						incapacitated, age was an irrelevant consideration 
						because she opined that growth or development of the 
						mental and physical faculties of a normal being was 
						non-existent to the 3rd plaintiff. In my view the 
						learned trial judge was right because there was credible 
						medical evidence in support of the view she held.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">With regard to the 
						question of the applicability of the provision of 
						section 13(1) of&nbsp; Act 360 to the 3rd plaintiff I have 
						found the construction placed on that subsection by the 
						learned author of &#8220;The Law of Wills&#8221; to be too draconian 
						and harsh with the greatest respect to the author. 
						Clearly he adopted the literal approach of statutory 
						construction. But I conceive it to be a solemn duty of a 
						court to construe a statue in such a way as would accord 
						with commonsense and justice. Thus in the English case 
						Re Margon-Wilson&#8217;s Will Trust 1968 Ch 268 at 282 Upgoed-Thomas 
						J said:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;If the court is to 
						avoid a statutory result that flouts common and justice 
						it must do so not by disregarding the statute or 
						overriding it, but by interpreting it in accordance with 
						the judicially presumed parliamentary concern for 
						commonsense and justice.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Court of Appeal in 
						English confirmed this dictum in Verdin v. Conghtrie 
						(Inspector of Taxes) (1961) Ac. 880 while at our own 
						shores here in Ghana the Supreme Court in a recent 
						published case Essilfie v. Anafo (1992) 2 GLR (Review) 
						Archer CJ (as he then was) presiding, adopted the 
						commonsense approach to the construction of statutes and 
						emphatically stated that the legislature would not 
						intend what is unreasonable. The policy-rationale behind 
						the age limitation to children under section 13(1) of 
						the Wills Acts, 1971 (Act 360) proceeds on the 
						understanding that at 18 a normal child would have been 
						capable of maintaining himself or herself by his or her 
						own effort.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 3rd plaintiff did 
						not fulfil this condition so the age limitation cannot 
						be applied to him. The last criticism of the Judgment 
						was that the learned judge erred by not applying funds 
						in the residue to settle the claim of the 1st and 3rd 
						plaintiffs. This ground of appeal has no merit because 
						as it have already explained&nbsp; above the residue fell 
						into intestacy and as such could not be applied under 
						the Wills Act 1971 (Act 360). Interested parties would 
						therefore have to advise themselves no application 
						relation to the intestate succession Law 1985 (PNDCL 
						111) was made before the High Court under the normal 
						procedure rules.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I must explain that 
						under the PNDCL 111 interested persons extend beyond 
						widows and children to parents and customary successors 
						of intestate property. In the such circumstances the 
						ends of justice would not be served if the court which 
						is called upon to provide reasonable provision under the 
						Wills Act 1971 (Act 360) assumed jurisdiction over 
						property treated as residue as in the instant case. For 
						the foregoing reasons I would dismiss the appeal and 
						affirm the judgment of the court below.</span></p>
