						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">WOOD, JA:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 
						Plaintiff/Respondent sued the three Defendant/Appellants 
						for general and special&nbsp; damages, as well as for the 
						return of building materials collected by them or their&nbsp; 
						value assessed at ¢100,000.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The brief facts upon 
						which he based his claim are that in 1970, the 3rd 
						appellant acting as his agent, bought and held in trust 
						for him an uncompleted building valued at ¢820, 
						expressed also as £425, and later conveyed the legal 
						title to him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">However in 1984, the 
						1st Appellant, in his capacity as head of his family, 
						sued the 2nd and 3rd Respondents in respect of the same 
						property, inter alia for a declaration of title, and 
						damages for trespass on the basis that the property sold 
						him was family property, it having devolved on the 
						family on the death intestate of the original owner, his 
						brother. The Respondent applied and was joined to the 
						suit as co-defendant.&nbsp; Those other parties however 
						settled the matter out of court and the case withdrawn 
						by the 1st Appellant, the Plaintiff in that suit&nbsp; 
						numbered L2/84. The Appellants subsequently caused the 
						subject matter which had then been completed by the 
						Respondent, obviously, at considerable cost to him to be 
						demolished, compelling him to institute these 
						proceedings in vindication of&nbsp; his rights.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Aside from the two 
						original grounds of appeal one of which is the usual 
						omnibus ground, the Appellant filed four other 
						additional grounds. Those which were specifically argued 
						were the&nbsp; &#8216;c&#8217;, &#8216;d&#8217; and &#8216;e&#8217; which state:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;(c)&nbsp; the trial judge 
						erred in law in&nbsp; not holding that the consent judgment 
						in suit no L2/84 could not be impugned except on stated 
						legal grounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d)&nbsp; The trial judge 
						erred in law in not holding that the purchase of the 
						land from 2nd Defendant who had no title or authority 
						from 1st Defendant could not pass title to the 
						Plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(e)&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial judge 
						erred in law in not resolving the legal effect of the 
						document executed by the 3rd Defendant without jurat in 
						favour of the Plaintiff when the 3rd Defendant pleaded 
						illiteracy&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 
						Plaintiff/Respondent however filed a notice of cross 
						appeal against that part of the decision of the court 
						which dismissed the claim for the return of the building 
						materials or their value and which failed to take 
						cognizance of the inflationary trends in the country 
						that has affected his original claim for special 
						damages.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Under the Court of 
						Appeal Rules, 1997, CI.19, however, it is not necessary 
						for a respondent who is nevertheless dissatisfied with 
						the judgment appealed from (by his opponent), to give 
						notice by way of a cross appeal. Where he/she also 
						intends to call for a variation of the decision 
						complained of (all that in required of him/her under the 
						rules) is to cause written notice in the model form 7 of 
						the schedule of his intention to be served on those 
						parties who may be affected by his contention at the 
						hearing of the appeal. What must also be included in the 
						notice is the grounds on which he intends to rely. The 
						proper procedure is clearly set out in self-evident 
						rules which I reproduce hereunder.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;15 Notice by 
						respondent of contention that judgment should be varied.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1.&nbsp; It shall not be 
						necessary for the respondent to give notice by way of 
						cross appeal, but if a respondent intends upon the 
						hearing of the appeal to contend that the decision of 
						the court below should be varied, he shall within one 
						month after service upon him of the notice of appeal 
						cause written notice as in Form 7 in part 1 of the 
						schedule of his intention to be given to every party who 
						may be affected by the contention.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2. The respondent shall 
						clearly state in his written notice the grounds on which 
						he intends to rely and within the same period shall file 
						with the registrar of the court below, five copies of 
						the notice, one of which shall be included in the 
						record&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">What then is the effect 
						of non-compliance with the rules, or more specifically 
						put, what are the consequences, if any, where in 
						contravention of the rules, a respondent as happened in 
						this instant case, has filed a cross-appeal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The answer to this 
						critical question may be found principally in the sub 
						rule (3) of Rule 15 of CI.19. Perhaps also rule 63 of 
						C.I. 19 as well as the undoubtedly just rule of equity 
						that it looks at the intent rather than the form.&nbsp; The 
						important sub rule (3), which affords a ready answer to 
						this question stipulates:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;omission to give the 
						written notice shall not affect any powers of the court, 
						but the&nbsp; court may consider it a ground for adjournment 
						of the appeal upon such terms as to costs or otherwise 
						as the court considers just&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Failure to comply with 
						the rules therefore is not fatal and would not affect 
						the powers of the court to receive arguments on the 
						contention and effect the necessarily just changes in 
						the decision complained of. It must be emphasized that 
						the rule does not forbid the issue of a notice of cross 
						appeal.&nbsp; It simply states that it is not a necessity, in 
						others words that it is a wholly unnecessary step. Of 
						course the court may, in appropriate cases, adjourn for 
						due compliance with the rules. Again since equity looks 
						at the substance rather than the form, the filing of the 
						notice of cross appeal rather than the forming is 
						obviously not fatal to the respondent&#8217;s case. I believe 
						the reasoning behind the rule15 (3) is again founded on 
						the rule 32 subrules (1) </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2).&nbsp; They state:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The court shall have 
						power to give any judgment and make any order that ought 
						to have been made and to make such further or other 
						orders as the case may require including any order as to 
						costs.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2)&nbsp; These powers of 
						the court may be exercised notwithstanding that 
						appellant may have asked that part only of a decision be 
						reversed or varied and may also be exercised in favour 
						of all or any of the respondent or parties, although the 
						respondent or parties may not have appealed from or 
						complained of the decision.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">One of the critical 
						issues raised at the trial was whether or not the 
						respondent was bound by outcomes of case numbered L2/84. 
						The appellants contented that it was a consent judgment 
						binding on the respondent and consequently that he is 
						estopped from relitigating the same matter. The learned 
						judge, maintaining that the plea of res judicata has 
						been raised identified the question the court will have 
						to resolve as follows: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220; Whether or not the 
						matter has been dealt with by suit No. L8/84 (sic)&#8221;. She 
						concluded that&#8221; in law the consent judgment entered in 
						Exhibit 4 does not affect the respondent. &#8220;The court 
						based its opinion on two grounds, both of which have 
						been described as erroneous.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">First that even though 
						the order for joinder was granted, the title of suit was 
						not amended&nbsp; to reflect this fact; the import of this 
						being that the respondent not being a party to the said 
						judgment was definitely not bound by it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Second, that in any 
						event, on being served with the decision of the court in 
						suit No. L2/84, &#8220;They reacted by filing &#8220;this present 
						action&#8221;. My understanding of the learned trial judge's 
						finding is that the respondent never accepted the terms 
						of the said judgment and never agreed to be bound by it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At this rehearing the 
						reasonings and the conclusion have been criticized on 
						the basis that firstly the law placed the burden of 
						ensuring that the title is amended to include the new 
						party squarely on the respondent. The argument therefore 
						is that, having failed to ensure due compliance with the 
						rules, it lies ill in his mouth to take advantage of his 
						own ineptitude and argue that he is not bound by the 
						decision. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Secondly, it was urged 
						that the respondent did not, in this instant action, 
						seek for a setting aside of the consent judgment and 
						consequently he cannot justify the position taken by the 
						trial judge, otherwise it would amount to the court 
						proprio motuo making a case for the respondent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">For my part, I would 
						like to emphasize that, although contrary to the rules 
						on pleading, the defendants did not specifically plead 
						estoppel per rem judicatam, in much the same way that&nbsp; 
						he expressly pleaded the Illiterates Protection 
						Ordinance, the cross examination of the respondent, 
						together with evidence they led through the 1st 
						defendant raised and indeed at this rehearing, justifies 
						a consideration of that issue, namely whether or not 
						the&nbsp; respondent was bound by the decision in&nbsp; Suit No. 
						L2/84, a decision described as a consent judgment, and I 
						proceed to do so now.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my opinion, the 
						learned trial judge's description of the &#8220;decision&#8221; in 
						L2/84 as a consent judgment is not quite accurate, for 
						it is not. I reproduce the main body of the day&#8217;s 
						proceedings which culminated in the court's order, which 
						had in my view been misdescribed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Tackie Otoo informs 
						court the matter has been amicably settled on payment of 
						¢30,000.00 by plaintiff to 2nd Defendant and therefore 
						wishes to withdraw the case.&nbsp; Also withdraws reliefs 
						under claims (b) and (a), 2nd Defendant admits the 
						payment to him of the ¢30,000.00.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">By&nbsp; Court:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Case withdrawn as 
						settled on terms above&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The clear picture 
						emerging from the Exh. 4 is that the claim was withdrawn 
						on the basis that it has been settled as between i.e. 
						the plaintiff and the defendant, the original parties. 
						In other words, the respondent was not included in that 
						arrangement. No judgment based on the terms was entered 
						aging. The necessarily implied substantive decision of 
						the court was that the case between those parties were 
						being struck out, (for it was withdrawn) hence my 
						judgment that the decision was not in the nature of a 
						consent judgment. A consent judgment by its very nature 
						must be one capable of enforcement by any of the known 
						legal modes of execution as provided for under the rules 
						of court. How does one execute an order withdrawing a 
						claim?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Be that as it may, the 
						key question however still stands unanswered.&nbsp; Is the 
						respondent estopped by the order in L2/84. Since the 
						evidence on both sides show clearly that even though the 
						respondent was a party to the suit L2/84, he was not a 
						party to the settlement (be it a valid customary or 
						negotiated settlement) he cannot be estopped from 
						relitigating this matter. I reproduce the answers the 
						respondent gave to question under cross examination as 
						well as when the 1st appellant gave his evidence in 
						chief. They all support the contentions I have made that 
						he was not a party to the alleged settlement.&nbsp; </span>

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp;&nbsp; I made motion

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Then, also the same 
						position was reiterated during the cross examination of 
						the Pw1.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you aware that 
						in 1984 there was a similar case involving this very 
						land between Opanin Donko who sued the 2nd and 3rd 
						defendants of which the plaintiff joined as 
						co-defendant.&nbsp; This was in suit No. L8/84?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The evidence of the 1st 
						defendant went thus:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Since the property 
						belongs to the family, the late 1st defendant sued the 
						2nd defendant whilst the matter was pending before the 
						court, the plaintiff joined the suit as a party on 
						whereas that the 3rd defendant as his nephew and so he 
						was to help the 3rd herein to litigate the action filed 
						by the original 1st defendant.&nbsp; The 3rd defendant then 
						realized that he could not fight the case and so he 
						agreed for the matter to be settled at have since it was 
						he who brought the litigation. The settlement was that 
						3rd defendant was to give details on his accounts on the 
						land. The final settlement was then the 1st original 
						defendant was to refund the sum of ¢30,000.00 to the 3rd 
						defendant and in return the land was to became that of 
						the original 1st defendant's&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">My view therefore is 
						that the judge was right in holding that the respondent 
						was not bound by the decision in LS.8/84 and indeed not 
						estopped from instituting this present action. 
						Notwithstanding the fact that his name is not included 
						in the title, the uncontroverted evidence is that he was 
						at the date of the settlement, a party to the action. 
						Rule 8(3) of LI. 1129 stipulates&nbsp; the stage that a 
						person which has successfully obtained an order for 
						joinder becomes a party to the action in respect of 
						which the order was made.&nbsp; By the rules, it is when the 
						writ has been amended in relation to him and if he is a 
						defendant (as happened in LS 8/84) has been served on 
						him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was never alleged at 
						the trial below that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1)&nbsp; The writ has not 
						been amended in relation to him or&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2)&nbsp; That he was never 
						served with it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is pertinent to note 
						however that if we took the position that he was not a 
						party, his case even becomes stranger; not being a party 
						to the suit, he cannot obviously be bound by the 
						settlement allegedly entered into by the parties.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the contrary, the 
						appellants persistently described him as a party to the 
						proceedings. The apparent deficiency in the title of the 
						writ notwithstanding, irrespective of what position we 
						took on his status in the action, the proper conclusion 
						is that, he was not a party to the settlement.&nbsp; He is 
						therefore not bound by it and is at liberty to institute 
						the present action.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A fundamental principle 
						of law is that where there are more then two parties to 
						an action, it is only these parties who settle their 
						claim(s) out of court who are bound by the compromise, 
						and not&nbsp; these others who were never parties to it.&nbsp; 
						Indeed, the Exh 3, the appellant's affidavit and which 
						formed the basis of the Exh 4 clearly shows, the 
						deponent, the appellant by accepting the ¢30,000 
						promising to relinquish all claims against Kwame Abassi, 
						and his family!&nbsp; The appeal based on the ground must 
						fail.&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Again, the learned 
						trial judge had concluded:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;It is the considered 
						view of the court that C.K.F has been able to prove his 
						case on&nbsp; balance of probabilities&nbsp; and on strength of 
						his own case&#8221;. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The simple and 
						straightforward argument urged in respect of the ground 
						(d) is that, contrary to the above finding, the 
						respondent was unable to establish that the 2nd 
						appellant had title in the disputed property, and which 
						he validly passed on to him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Undoubtedly, the title 
						of the respondent who had sued for damages for trespass 
						fell issue.&nbsp; More significantly, the appellants have in 
						their amended statement of defence denied his claim that 
						the property belonged to 2nd appellant and called him to 
						strict proof of these averments. Their contention was 
						that the property which was originally owned by their 
						family member, one Gyabaah, became family property on 
						his death instestate.&nbsp; Having regard to the pleadings as 
						they stood, the respondent's argument that on the 
						authority of </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1)&nbsp; Otoo v. Biney 
						(1966) GLR 136</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2)&nbsp; Hayfrom v, Egyir 
						(1984-1986) GLR 510 </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">the respondents suing 
						only for damages for trespass without claiming for 
						perpetual injunction, meant automatically that his title 
						was not put in issue, is to say the least untenable.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the contrary, the 
						very case relied on by counsel, namely Hayfrom v. Egyir 
						(supra) firstly did not lay down any such proposition of 
						law and&nbsp; secondly supports the view that&nbsp; he had to 
						prove his grantors title.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Twumasi J as he then 
						was held:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;where a party derived 
						his title to land from some one&nbsp; else, either by way of 
						gift or purchase or other form of alternation alienation 
						of land, it was incumbent upon that party whose title 
						was derivative to prove the title of his&nbsp; grantor or 
						vendor or donor as the case might be. I would add that 
						failure to prove affirmative by rely to prove ones root 
						of title or the title of ones grantor, vendor or donor 
						as the case might be, particularly as happened in this 
						instant case when it is put in issue, is fatal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The question therefore 
						is did respondent succeed in discharging the burden that 
						lay an him?&nbsp; I would answer in the affirmative.&nbsp; His 
						oral testimony which noticeably was not challenged under 
						cross-examination was confirmed by two persons the Pw2 
						who shared a boundary with the 2nd appellant and who 
						also acted as an agent of the 3rd appellant in the&nbsp; sale 
						transaction. He is also an elder, of Moree. He is the 
						Twatohene.&nbsp; Both persons are emphatic that the land 
						belonged to the 2nd appellant. I think considerable 
						weight must be attached to the evidence of the Pw3 
						because he does not have any interest in the case and 
						also because he actually &#8220;took part in granting of the 
						land to the 2nd&#8221; appellant.&nbsp; He was emphatic that &#8220;2nd 
						defendant started to develop the land by putting up a 
						structure on it. He further recounted: I know one Kofi 
						Gyabaah of Moree Kofi Gyabaah did not put up any 
						structure on the land granted of (sic) the 2nd 
						defendant&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Against this evidence 
						of the respondent, we have that of the 3rd appellant's, 
						one of the principal actors in this whole drama which 
						has been aptly described by the trial judge as a 
						gossamer.&nbsp; His evidence which I have taken the trouble 
						to reproduce, would on the balance of propabilities, 
						confirm the position that the land could not have been 
						family property but rather belonged to the 2nd 
						appellant.&nbsp; He deposed as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;My father told me the 
						land belonged to the 2nd defendant.&nbsp; After about 13 
						years later I have bought the land from 2nd defendant&nbsp; 
						he came tell me the land did not belong to him but he 
						sold it to me due to financial difficulties &#8230;&#8230; Later the 
						2nd defendant reported the matter to the police and I 
						was arrested to Cape Coast Police Regional 
						Headquarters.&nbsp; However, the 2nd defendant did not 
						disclose the one who really owned the land&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Under cross-examination 
						he confirmed that at all material times the owner of the 
						property was the 2nd appellant.&nbsp; This answer he gave to 
						the following question again confirmed his evidence that 
						2nd appellant would not disclose the name of the elder 
						who allegedly owned the property.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp; &#8220;Did the 2nd 
						defendant mention the name of the elder who owned the 
						land</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp;&nbsp; No.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">If the family were the 
						real owners of the property, why did it take them as 
						long as 13 years before stepping in to challenge the 
						validity of the sale?&nbsp; Again why was the 2nd appellant 
						not forthcoming, even at the police station, with the 
						name of who owned the land? It can only be because 
						indeed he was the true owner, with the story about 
						Gyabaah being a clear after thought, brought into enable 
						him wriggle out of the sale, and enable him get his 
						property back.&nbsp; In coming to this conclusion, I have 
						attached no weight to the evidence of the 3rd 
						appellant&#8217;s witness for the clear confession he made 
						under cross-examination was that his evidence was not 
						first hand, but a mere repition of what the 3rd 
						appellant who had been struck down by stroke, asked him 
						to come to court to say.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Q.&nbsp; So what you have 
						told the court is what the 2nd defendant asked you to 
						say on his behalf.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest to you 
						that the condition of the 2nd defendant could not have 
						given you proper instruction as his condition as it was 
						in May 1999 (sic).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No since I my 
						self have been told of his side of&nbsp; the case before he 
						fell ill&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I am therefore of the 
						view that the evidence supports the finding that the 
						property belonged to the 2nd appellant, consequently, he 
						passed valid title to the respondent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Exh B was tendered 
						at the trail by the respondent, in whose favour a 
						resulting trust was created when the 3rd appellant 
						bought the property in his own name with funds provided 
						by 3rd appellant, in proof of two things. First, and 
						crucially, to prove that the legal interest had 
						subsequently been transferred to him.&nbsp; Of course the 
						learned trial judge made no specific findings on the 
						legal effect of the exhibit B, which is a document made 
						by one who the evidence overwhelmingly shows was 
						illiterate.&nbsp; As a result, I find it difficult to dismiss 
						the criticisms raised by the ground (e)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I however, agree with 
						counsel&nbsp; that on the authorities, the Exh B cannot 
						sustain the&nbsp; claim that the legal interest had been 
						transferred to the respondent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A long line of cases 
						stretching from (BP West Africa) Ltd v. Boateng [1963] 
						1, GLR 232 to Mahama Hausa v. Baako Hausa [1972] 2GLR 
						469 and the more recent cases of Kotokoli v. Sarbah 
						[1981] GLR 496 and Zambrahah v. Segbedzi [1992] GLR 221, 
						clearly emphasizes that in order to found any claim on 
						the Exh B, the respondent must establish positively that 
						it was indeed read over and explained to the illiterate 
						maker and who therefore understood the nature and 
						consequences of the document. I do not, however think 
						that the respondent succeeded in establishing this fact.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Nevertheless, there is 
						evidence to justify the trial judge's final conclusion 
						that &#8220;he was able to prove his case on balance of 
						probabilities&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Why do I say so?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">First, the claim that 
						he provided the purchase money is confirmed not only by 
						his witnesses Pw1 and Pw2 both of whom were emphatic 
						that 2nd appellant did disclose to them that the 
						property was bought on behalf of the respondent, but 
						also could be gathered from 3rd appellant's own 
						evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On his own showing &#8220;the 
						plaintiff even applied to be joined as a party to this 
						suit and he has so joined. The plaintiff decided to 
						settle the matter and so gave document for me to claim 
						my purchase money &#8230;.&#8221;&nbsp; Why would he allow respondent to 
						intervene and take major decisions on what was to be 
						done, if he were not the owner of the subject matter?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Also the evidence 
						clearly shows that he put him in possession, thus 
						enabling him to complete the building on the land.&nbsp; Even 
						if at that date, he was only an equitable owner, he 
						continued in such effective possession until the 
						invasion by the 1st and 2nd appellant which ultimately 
						led to the destruction of his property.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">However, liability 
						would attach to only the 1st and 2nd appellants since on 
						the respondent's own showing, these acts of destruction 
						were perpetrated at their instigation.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Respondent&#8217;s Cross 
						Appeal</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Two grounds (c) and (d) 
						were argued, with the other two being abandoned. The 
						complaint in respect of the ground (c) is that having 
						found the appellants liable, the damages awarded was 
						woefully in adequate.&nbsp; It was argued that the damage 
						awarded should not only reflect the court's disapproval 
						of the tortfeasors' conduct in taking the law into their 
						own hands, but should be such as would put the victim 
						back into the same position in which he was before the 
						tort was committed.&nbsp; It was also contended that in 
						awarding damages, the court ought to have taken into 
						consideration the fast depreciation of the cedi and the 
						escalation in prices of building materials&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Quite plainly, the 
						court was right in dismissing the claim for special 
						damages for the simple reason that no evidence was led 
						in proof of the quantum pleaded.&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The ground (d) and the 
						arguments urged in support thereof are in relation to 
						the claim for general damages.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the fact 
						that it was endorsed contrary to law at the specific sum 
						of ¢500,000.00 the lament is that it is inadequate, 
						seeing that the true measure of damages, is intended to 
						put respondent in the same position that he was before 
						the destruction.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Dodd Properties Ltd and 
						Anor v. Canterbury City Council and others [1979] 2 ALL 
						ER 118 spells out the principles governing the 
						assessment of damages in the case of building damaged 
						and put in need of repair by the tortuous act of 
						another. The court held that the&nbsp; victim was entitled to 
						&#8220;the reasonable cost of doing reasonable work of 
						restoration and repair.&#8221;&nbsp; Further that the general 
						principle is that damages must be assessed at the date 
						when the damage occurs&#8221;, the only rider being that the 
						rule ought not to be &#8220;rigidly applied as a rule of items 
						fixing the time rigidly by calendar and the clock&#8221; page 
						126 refers. Therefore, where the damage was not 
						reasonably discoverable for some time, or where it would 
						take time to put the repairs in hand, the rule would be 
						relaxed.&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Unfortunately, in this 
						instant case, the respondent did not lead any evidence 
						on the reasonable cost of replacement as at the date of 
						destruction or when it was most physically reasonable to 
						commence the reconstruction.&nbsp; The only evidence we have 
						of the investment or expenditure made in the land are:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1. The initial cost of 
						the property which is ¢850.00 and the subsequent outlay

						¢84,500. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Under these 
						circumstances, I find that the damages of ¢500,000.00 
						takes care of all the concerns raised.&nbsp; I find it fair 
						and reasonable.&nbsp; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Having regard to what

						be dismissed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the other hand, I do 
						agree with appellant counsel that the costs of ¢300,000 
						awarded was grossly inadequate, having regard to the 
						fact that the case spanned a period of 15 years. Costs 
						of ¢2m as against 1st and 2nd appellants would be 
						reasonable and just.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
