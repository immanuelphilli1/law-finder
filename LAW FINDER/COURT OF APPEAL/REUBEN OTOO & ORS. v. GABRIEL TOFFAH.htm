						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Appeal is from the 
						judgment of His Honour A. Oppong Circuit Court Judge 
						Accra, dated 11th day of July, 2002.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">By the said judgment 
						the trial judge granted all the reliefs sought by the 
						Plaintiff-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the 
						Plaintiffs).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Granting the reliefs 
						the trial judge stated- 'Upon the foregoing it is my 
						judgment that the land under consideration belongs to 
						Otu Kofi family.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I therefore, order 
						defendant to account to the head of the family (1st 
						Plaintiff herein) all proceeds by way of rent collected 
						from the date of the receipt of the letter Exhibit &quot;C&quot; 
						which appears to be 1st June 2000 when exhibit &quot;D&quot; was 
						written.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I order perpetual 
						injunction restraining defendant his agents assigns etc 
						from dealing in anyway with the property. In effect the 
						caretakership of defendant is hereby terminated with 
						immediate effect. Plaintiffs shall have their costs 
						assessed at ¢1.2 million against the defendant&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The decision and order 
						made follow a careful evaluation and assessment by the 
						trial judge of the evidence on record .</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Defendant-Appellant 
						(hereinafter referred to as Defendant) is aggrieved and 
						or dissatisfied with the said judgment of the trial 
						judge and has filed this appeal against same and 
						inviting the court to reverse the judgment in his 
						favour.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Defendant's appeal is 
						on two grounds namely:&#8212; &quot;that the learned Circuit Judge 
						erred in holding that the property in question is a 
						family property of Otu Kofi.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) Later Defendant 
						filed additional ground thus: &quot;The Learned Circuit Judge 
						erred in law in holding that the parties were 'ad idem' 
						with regard to the identity of the land and therefore, 
						the onus of proof required by law as regards the 
						identity of land in dispute has been discharged&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">One of the main 
						purposes of an appeal is to correct errors and the 
						defendant saying that the trial judge has erred has 
						taken upon himself the onerous task of demonstrating to 
						court that the trial court either failed to consider 
						very essential or relevant evidence on record or 
						misapplied the law. More so as in the instant case where 
						the appeal is against the findings of fact made by the 
						trial judge.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Defendant has to 
						persuade the court that the findings of the trial 
						Circuit judge were either improperly made or not made in 
						accordance with the law.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the defendants' 
						ground (1) that&#8212;The learned Circuit Judge erred in 
						holding that the property in dispute is a family 
						property of Otu Kofi,</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is the submission of 
						the defendant that this is so because as he/put it there 
						is no evidence on record connecting the land in question 
						to the family of Otu Kofi&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Having so stated, the 
						defendant goes on to make further submissions which I 
						find to be contradicting his own stand and, therefore, 
						not supportive of his case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendant states 
						that the only evidence on record emanates from the third 
						plaintiff, Rudolph Otoo. 3rd plaintiff according to 
						defendant referred to Exhibit &quot;B&quot; paragraph &quot;6&quot; as the 
						source of his claim.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In fact, it is on the 
						same evidence of the 3rd plaintiff that the trial judge 
						relied to support his finding. The 3rd plaintiff's 
						evidence which supported the trial judge's finding read 
						as follows: 3rd plaintiffs evidence is that the land 
						belonged to the late Otu Kofi. He made a device of it 
						(see paragraph &quot;6&quot; of Exhibit &quot;B&quot;).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After his death, 3rd 
						plaintiff testified further that, his father and another 
						uncle managed the property on behalf of the family and 
						it was defendant who collected rents and accounted to 
						3rd plaintiffs father.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This piece of evidence 
						was admitted by the defendant when he did say that the 
						land belonged to one Joseph Kabu Otoo who according to 
						the evidence on record was the father of the 3rd 
						plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Defendant admitted 
						further that he and other tenants pay rent currently to 
						Alex and Nora Otoo who are brothers and sisters to 3rd 
						plaintiff and cousins to the rest of the plaintiffs. It 
						can be observed that the Defendant himself did not know 
						the real owners of the land. When Defendant was asked a 
						question that the land does not belong to Joseph Kabu 
						Otoo solely defendants answer was that&#8212;&quot;I do Not know&quot; 
						Again the trial judge found it strange that when action 
						was taken against the Defendant by the Plaintiffs, both 
						Alex and Nora Otoo to whom Defendant was paying the rent 
						on the land were identified in Court yet they failed to 
						give any protection or assistance to Defendant. This is 
						suggestive of the fact that the two Alex and Nora Otoo 
						knew that whatever they did by accepting the rents on 
						the land from the defendant was so done in concealment 
						from the family, and did not have the family's approval. 
						Defendant is not a member of Otu Kofi's family, in fact, 
						a total stranger, and could not determine who the 
						members of the family are, and what properties belong to 
						the family.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">By the additional 
						ground i.e. &quot; The learned Circuit judge erred in law in 
						holding that the parties were &quot;ad idem&quot; with regard to 
						the identity of the land and therefore the onus of proof 
						required by law as regards the identity of land in 
						dispute has been discharged&quot;. The Defendant is 
						understood to be saying that plaintiffs failed to 
						identify the land in dispute. Plaintiffs in the instant 
						case were not claiming title to the land. Their claims 
						were for Accounts and an injunction. Even though a claim 
						for injunction postulates that the claimants &#8212; i.e 
						plaintiffs are the owners of the land the subject matter 
						in dispute. See the cases of KWABENA V; ATUAHENE (1981) 
						GLR P.136 and Anane vs: Donkor (1965) GLR 188.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In our instant case, 
						there was no dispute as to ownership of the land between 
						the plaintiff and the defendant. Plaintiffs asserted 
						ownership as per the evidence of the 3rd plaintiff. They 
						claimed that defendant was their caretaker.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Defendant in his 
						evidence admitted being a caretaker for some members of 
						the plaintiffs' family - Alex and Nora Otoo. Defendant 
						did say in his evidence that His caretakership dated 
						from 1960 when he was caretaker for the late Joseph Kabu 
						Otoo.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">With the Court's 
						finding that Plaintiffs are members of the late Otu 
						Kofi's family and the land in dispute which defendant 
						admits being the caretaker thereof, he remained the 
						caretaker for the plaintiff's family. Defendant's 
						caretakership puts him in a position of an agent of the 
						plaintiffs.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He does not deny 
						knowledge of the identity of the land in dispute. His 
						knowledge can therefore, be imputed to that of the 
						plaintiffs, to support the findings of the trial judge 
						appealed against by the defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I therefore, find that 
						the findings of the trial judge are borne out of the 
						evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I find no strong urge 
						on the Court to disturb the said findings.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the totality of 
						matters above stated and together with other reasons 
						given by the trial judge, I dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
