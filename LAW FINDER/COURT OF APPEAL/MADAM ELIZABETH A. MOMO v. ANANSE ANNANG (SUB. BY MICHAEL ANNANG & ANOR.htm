												JUDGMENT</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												MRS. WOOD, J.A.:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In this case in both parties, 
												claiming the same piece of land 
												through their respective late 
												grandfathers, have prayed for 
												similar reliefs, namely </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) declaration of title,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) damages for trespass,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(c) perpetual injunction</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Additionally, the plaintiff 
												appellant sought for an order 
												that the defendant respondents, 
												who were substituted for their 
												father, the original defendant 
												who died in the course of the 
												proceedings, do at torn tenancy 
												to her or alternately she does 
												recover possession of the 
												disputed property from them.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellant, who instituted 
												the action in her capacity as 
												the customary successor to her 
												late father for herself and on 
												behalf of her brother, did not 
												describe the land claimed in 
												either her writ or the statement 
												of claim. What she did, and 
												which in my view was contrary to 
												the rules governing pleadings 
												was to attach a plan and mark it 
												as Exh A and allege that is the 
												disputed land. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Her case was simply that her 
												late grandfather, who was the 
												Linguist to the Nungua Chief, 
												Mantse Tawiah, acquired a usur 
												fructury title to a larger piece 
												of land and farmed on it with 
												the consent of the stool and its 
												elders. According to her, her 
												father subsequently inherited 
												the disputed land from his 
												father and continued farming 
												thereon. The respondent she 
												claimed, sometime ago trespassed 
												unto their land by putting up a 
												self-contained house on a 
												portion of their land. But a 
												subsequent arbitration adjudged 
												them owners of the disputed land 
												and warned them off the said 
												land. She was however compelled 
												to institute these proceedings 
												in protection of her family&#8217;s 
												right when much to her chagrin, 
												she was subsequently prevented 
												by the respondents from making 
												further developments on the land 
												they in turn inherited from 
												their father.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The respondent did not merely 
												deny all the material averments 
												on which the claim was founded, 
												but contended that it was rather 
												the appellant, who by erecting a 
												one bed roomed house on the 
												disputed land was guilty of 
												trespass since their late father 
												had as far back as 1965 been an 
												owner in possession and have 
												exercised various overt and 
												undisturbed acts of ownership 
												over it. Additionally, they 
												maintained the claim is (1) 
												statute barred and (2) the 
												appellant is estopped by laches 
												and acquiescence from 
												institutions this action.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The interesting matter is that 
												both parties are building an in 
												occupation on the land. In this 
												appeal based on as may as 14 
												grounds, the first of which is 
												the usual omnibus ground, &#8220;the 
												judgment is against the weight 
												of evidence&#8221;, the grounds, 3, 4 
												and 6 raises two pertinent 
												issues; namely,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) whether or not she led 
												evidence in proof of a valid 
												arbitration and </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) if yes, was she then 
												entitled to institute this fresh 
												proceedings, when the same issue 
												of ownership to the disputed 
												land had already been disposed 
												of by the arbitration? </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Undoubtedly, one of the critical 
												issues which fell for 
												determination from the 
												pleadings, was whether or not 
												there had been a valid 
												arbitration between their 
												predecessors over ownership of 
												the disputed land. The 
												appellants claim that there had 
												been such an arbitration and 
												more importantly her averment by 
												the paragraph &quot;13f&quot; of her 
												amended statement of claim that 
												&#8220;the arbitrators made an award 
												in favour of the plaintiffs 
												father and warned and 
												consequently further that she 
												was stopped by conduct and the 
												award the defendant off the 
												land&#8221;, from challenging 
												appellants title was flatly 
												denied by the respondents.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												After reviewing the evidence led 
												by the appellant in proof of the 
												alleged arbitration, the trial 
												judge rightly in my view, but 
												albeit for the wrong reasons, 
												concluded &#8220;that the fact that 
												plaintiff has brought this 
												instant action presupposes that 
												no such arbitration look place.&#8221; 
												In other words he drew the 
												inference that no arbitration 
												had taken place from the fact of 
												the institution of this action. 
												While I would say that that line 
												of reasoning is faulty, I am 
												nevertheless not in agreement 
												with appellant counsel that 
												there is cogent evidence to 
												support of the appellants 
												assertion of a valid 
												arbitration.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Undoubtedly, the burden of 
												establishing that there has been 
												a valid arbitration lay on the 
												appellant who asserted the fact 
												and is relying on the award to 
												stop the respondent from 
												challenging her title to the 
												disputed property. See S.10 and 
												11 of the Evidence Decree, 1975 
												NRCD 323.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Again, the essential ingredients 
												of a valid arbitration has long 
												been settled in a long line of 
												cases notably, Budu V Caesar 
												1959 GLR 410; Donkor vrs Issifu 
												1963 GLR 418, Nyaasemhwe V 
												Affibiyesan 1977 1 GLR 27, and 
												Sulia vr Glavee 1991 1 GLR 194.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Unfortunately, the appellant did 
												not in her evidence take the 
												trouble to prove any of the 
												prerequisites of a valid 
												arbitration so clearly outlined 
												in the decided cases. But 
												perhaps the default is 
												understandable. By the paragraph 
												8 of the amended statement of 
												claim, the alleged arbitration 
												took place in her absence. 
												Consequently, she stood in no 
												position to depose to matters 
												outside her knowledge. But 
												certainly the same cannot be 
												said of the PW2, the only 
												alleged surviving arbitrator. 
												But, in all honesty it is very 
												doubtful whether he was indeed 
												an arbitrator. According to the 
												appellant, this only surviving 
												arbitrator is known as Okuwornu 
												Kwei, the present head of 
												family. But the PW2 gave his 
												name as Stephen Out Okey and we 
												have no explanation offered 
												about this marked inconsistency. 
												Even so, this man gave no 
												evidence of two important 
												matters: (1) a voluntary 
												submission or (2) a prior 
												agreement to be bound by the 
												award; two of the critical 
												ingredients which must be 
												present in any valid and 
												consequently binding 
												arbitration.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Another disturbing matter is 
												this. This witness&#8217;s testimony 
												does not point to a valid 
												arbitration. He testified that 
												money for drinks which were 
												allegedly served at the said 
												hearing was provided, as the law 
												would have expected not by the 
												parties to the arbitration, i.e. 
												the disputants, but by the 
												arbitrators themselves. In the 
												absence of clear evidence from 
												the appellant in proof of a 
												valid arbitration, I have no 
												option, but to conclude, as did 
												the trial judge, that no 
												arbitration (Kwaw v Awortwi 
												1989-90 1GLR 190 CA refers) nor 
												a building award has been 
												proved. It is because I find 
												none proved that the appellant 
												is entitled to institute this 
												present action. Therefore the 
												trial judges view that he could 
												relitigate the issue of 
												ownership is perfectly valid, 
												the clear position of the law 
												being that parties to a valid 
												arbitration are estopped from 
												relitigating the same issues in 
												a subsequent action. These 
												apart, it was absolutely 
												essential that she proved the 
												award, her contention being that 
												the respondent begged and was 
												allowed a continued stay in the 
												house and warned not to carry 
												out further developments on the 
												disputed land. Even so, I do 
												find that the evidence of the 
												appellant and her witnesses on 
												the award made, conflicting. 
												Whereas she contended that his 
												apology was accepted and he was 
												warned off the rest of the land, 
												his version was that he was 
												asked to remain in the house 
												until he found another house and 
												relocated to that place.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It would, under these 
												circumstances be manifestly 
												wrong to hold that he is bound 
												by any such an award of the 
												arbitrators, or even a 
												negotiated settlement since by 
												the paragraph 13K of her 
												statement of claim, she also 
												spoke of respondents being bound 
												by &#8220;Terms of understanding&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This takes us to the ground 7 
												namely</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The trial judge misdirected 
												himself and erred in law in 
												holding that the plaintiff 
												failed to prove her root of 
												title whereas the plaintiff 
												proved both a prior possession 
												by her grandfather and own 
												fathers family followed by 
												documentation in her name by the 
												Nungua stool after her father&#8217;s 
												death.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is trite learning that in 
												this instant action, the burden 
												of persuasion lay first on the 
												appellant and then the 
												respondent counterclaimant. Each 
												succeeded on the strength of his 
												or her own case. The learned 
												trial judge, rightly recognizing 
												the duty cast on the appellant 
												summed it up correctly as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;For plaintiff to succeed in 
												this action she must be able to 
												positively define her boundaries 
												and establish the identity of 
												the land.&#8221; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is not only the case of 
												Kwabena V Atuahene 1981 GLR 136 
												relied on by the trial judge, 
												which laid down this 
												proposition, but the more recent 
												cases like Nyikplokpor v Agbodo 
												for 1987-1988 1 GLR 165, 
												reiterates the same principle. 
												This court unanimously speaking 
												through Abban JA (of blessed 
												memory) as he then was held as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;To succeed in an action for 
												declaration of title to land, 
												recovery of possession and for 
												injunction, the plaintiff must 
												establish by positive evidence 
												the identity and limits of the 
												land which he claimed.&#8221; </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In that case, the court 
												specifically held that: </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;No court of justice could be 
												expected to give a declaration 
												of title or recovery of 
												possession to a plaintiff in 
												respect of an area whose 
												boundaries were so uncertain.&#8221;
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A more recent authority is 
												Yomervu v Awutu 1987 &#8211; 1988 1 
												GLR 9. This court, in defining 
												the duty cast on a claimant who 
												admits his opponent had land 
												adjoining his or hers said:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The plaintiffs claim was 
												founded in trespass which was in 
												law a violation of his 
												possessory rights. And since he 
												had admitted that the defendants 
												had land adjoining to his, in 
												order to succeed it was 
												necessary to have described the 
												trespass area and the area in 
												his possession with clarity.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Again, the fact that the 
												boundaries of a claimant are 
												clearly shown on a survey plan 
												does not relieve a claimant from 
												proving his boundaries by 
												credible evidence eg. calling 
												his boundary owners to 
												corroborate his claim as shown 
												on the survey plan. Thus in Badu 
												v Agbi 1972 2 GLR 238 CA, the 
												2nd plaintiff who failed to call 
												his northern boundary owner as a 
												witness lost the action, even 
												though his survey plan showed 
												the identity of the land 
												claimed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellant had, per paragraph 
												6 of her statement of claim 
												averred that &#8220;her grandfather 
												and the defendant grandfather 
												abutted each other&#8221;, a fact the 
												respondent unequivocally 
												admitted.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Appellant however failed to call 
												a single boundary owner to prove 
												positively and with clarity her 
												land and the trespassed area. 
												Worse still, the court appointed 
												surveyor who drew a demarcated 
												composite plan of the area, by a 
												survey and super imposition of 
												the disputants plans, gave this 
												telling answer to a question put 
												to him under cross examination.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Q.&nbsp; What the plaintiff is 
												claiming on the plan is 
												different from what she is 
												claiming the land.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A. Yes&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Indeed a look at the composite 
												plan exh CE 1 shows that the 
												land claimed by the appellant 
												per her plan, is miles away from 
												the physical land she pointed 
												out to the surveyor as belonging 
												to her.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Again, her attempt to prove her 
												title by tendering the Exh B as 
												corroborative proof of her oral 
												assertion, proved her undoing. 
												Exh B turned out to be 
												inconsistent with and 
												contradictory of her mode of 
												acquisition as pleaded and as 
												testified to. So in short, she 
												failed to prove her root of 
												title, for it spoke of a 
												leasehold interest granted to 
												her by the Nungua stool from the 
												9th of April and at the yearly 
												rent of ¢ 600,000.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												She was asked under 
												cross-examination </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Q. What is the basis of your 
												claim?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A. I want my land back.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Q. What authority do you have of 
												any in bringing this action?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A. The land belongs to my late 
												father and that is why I have 
												brought this action.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Q. What do you have to show that 
												the land belongs to your late 
												father?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A.&nbsp; I have a document to cover 
												it.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												That document is the Exh B which 
												as I have shown is patently 
												inconsistent with her claim.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It does follow on her own 
												showing that she was not 
												entitled to succeed and the 
												learned trial judge was right in 
												denying her title to the 
												disputed property.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In this connection, I find that 
												grounds 8, 9 and 10, which are 
												inexonerably linked with the 
												ground 7, would not alter the 
												fortunes of the appellant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The more pertinent and 
												self-explanatory ground states:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;(8) The court below erred by 
												holding that the registered 
												document that replaced the 
												earlier frustrated document, 
												displaced the plaintiffs pleaded 
												root of title whereas the law 
												clearly stated in Bruce v 
												Quarnor 1959 GLR was that a 
												subsequent conveyance might add 
												to but derogate from either 
												usufructury right or on express 
												prior customary grant.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(9) The trial judge erred in law 
												in supporting that once a 
												document prepared for execution 
												by Chief of Nungua had been 
												frustrated from execution by the 
												said chief&#8217;s death, it was 
												impossible for a fresh document 
												to be prepared and executed in 
												the successor chiefs name.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I would concede that since a 
												stool has perpetual succession, 
												the new Nungua chief could only 
												be entitled to execute a 
												conveyance in his name in 
												respect of the land in question. 
												But then, one would have thought 
												that narrative recitals in the 
												instrument, would have set the 
												records straight by the removed 
												of all doubts, and setting out 
												the facts inconsistencies and 
												contradictions. Admittedly 
												narrative recitals are not 
												generally strictly speaking 
												necessary, but they serve, (and 
												could have served) a useful 
												purpose in this instant case. 
												There being none in the Exh B, 
												it has resulted in her Exh,B 
												being found inconsistent with 
												her case as pleaded and the oral 
												evidence led.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I would not interfere with the 
												trial judges findings and 
												dismissal of her claim, which 
												was supported by the record.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the facts, the respondent&#8217;s 
												counterclaimants were as 
												correctly found by the trial 
												judge entitled to relief (a) a 
												declaration of their possessory 
												title to the disputed land.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The reason being that</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) they have demonstrated that 
												they have also been in 
												undisturbed possession of the 
												land since 1965.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Unlike their appellants, the 
												disputed land falls squarely 
												within their land as claimed for 
												their site plan (see the 
												composite plan Exh CR1).&nbsp; I have 
												already held they have not been 
												adjudged to be trespassers as 
												alleged by their appellant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Contrary to the learned trial 
												judges finding they would also 
												be entitled to damages, though 
												in my view minimal, for the 
												trespass to the land. They are 
												also entitled to the order of 
												permanent injunction save that 
												persons claiming through her, 
												and who are already in 
												possession of parts of the 
												disputed land and in respect of 
												whom no order for recovery of 
												possession has been sought, 
												shall remain in such undisturbed 
												occupation.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I would in the circumstances 
												dismiss the appeal and subject 
												the orders in respect of the 
												respondent to the variation made 
												in this judgment.</span></p>
