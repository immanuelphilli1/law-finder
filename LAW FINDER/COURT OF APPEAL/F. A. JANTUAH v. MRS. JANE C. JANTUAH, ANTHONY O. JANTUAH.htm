						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is an appeal from 
						the judgment of the High Court, Kumasi, given on 8th 
						November 1996. The plaintiff sought a declaration that 
						H/No. Block 6, Dichemso, Kumasi was acquired from the 
						proceeds from his pharmacy in Kumasi and the sale of his 
						Vanguard Saloon car.&nbsp; He also sought a declaration that 
						a cocoa farm at Atronie in Atuahenekrom, Brong Ahafo 
						Region, was acquired by Madam Afua Gyamaa and was family 
						property. Lastly, he sought a perpetual injunction to 
						restrain the plaintiff and her descendants from 
						interfering with the subject matter of this suit.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendant denied 
						the plaintiff&#8217;s claim and also counterclaimed for the 
						reliefs that the aforementioned house and the cocoa farm 
						at Atronie are the bona fide properties of her deceased 
						husband, the late John Adutwum Jantuah.&nbsp; She further 
						counter-claimed for a declaration that some 15 piece of 
						cloth and items of furniture that the plaintiff took 
						away belonged to her husband; she sought an order for 
						their recovery from the plaintiff.&nbsp; She asked for 
						restraining orders against the plaintiff concerning 
						these properties. I must remark that after summons for 
						directions had been take and the trial was in progress 
						and the plaintiff had closed his case, he for no reason 
						made apparent to the court, abandoned his case 
						completely.&nbsp; With that, all his claims went away and 
						were no longer the subject of the trial.&nbsp; That left the 
						defendant alone to prosecute her counterclaim in court.
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Of the evidence the 
						Court of Appeal will have special regard to the facts 
						that the judge saw the witnesses; see Clarke v. 
						Edinburgh Tramways Co, [1919]S.C. (H.L.) 35-36 per Lord 
						Shaw where he says: &#8220; Where he hears and sees witnesses 
						and makes a conclusion or inference with regard to what 
						is the weight on balance of their evidence, that 
						judgment is entitled to great respect and that quite 
						irrespective of whether the Judge makes any observation 
						with regard to credibility or not&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There are indeed great 
						deals of locally decided cases on when the Court of 
						Appeal will or not interfere with the decision of a 
						lower court.&nbsp; In Boateng v. Boateng [1987-88] GLR 81 
						C.A. it was held that where an appellant contended that 
						a judgment was against the weight of evidence, he 
						assumed the burden of showing from the evidence that 
						that was so.&nbsp; Nyame v Tarzan transport [1973] 1 GLR. 8 
						at 9 also stated the principles upon which an appellate 
						court would be disposed to or will not be so inclined to 
						reverse a decision of a lower court (see also Praka v 
						Ketewa [ 1964] GLR. 438, S.C; Oppong Kofi v Fofie 1964 
						GLR. 174; Bonney v Bonney [1991-92 GLR. 779.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I don&#8217;t think the 
						condition in the above case were satisfied so as to 
						compel this&nbsp; Court to disturbed the finding of facts and 
						the conclusion by the Judge.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the facts of this 
						case as rightly found by the trial judge all relevant 
						documents of title were in the name of the deceased.&nbsp; 
						The common law presumption in those circumstances was 
						that he had the legal title to the property.&nbsp; That was 
						not all; he also had the full ownership of the 
						beneficial title as well.&nbsp; Section 35 of the Evidence 
						Decree (supra) has preserved this presumption.&nbsp; It made 
						it a rebuttable presumption though.&nbsp; The onus of 
						rebutting this presumption was on the appellant.&nbsp; On the 
						facts as found by the trial judge (and I have no good 
						and compelling reasons to assail his findings on those 
						facts), the appellant did not in my view succeed in 
						rebutting that presumption.&nbsp; </span></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">My Lords, in this 
						appeal the questions which arise for our determination 
						as can be discerned from the pleadings of the parties in 
						terms of the controversy which sparked off the action in 
						the court below and indeed the statements submitted to 
						us in these proceedings are whether or not the building 
						standing on plot number 19 block 6, Dichemso, Kumasi 
						belonged to the appellant herein or formed part of the 
						estate of his deceased brother whose widow and child are 
						the first and second respondents respectively; and also 
						whether or not the cocoa farm situate at Atrohenekrom in 
						the Brong Ahafo Region belonged to the said deceased or 
						the family to which he belonged in his lifetime? So 
						stated, the instant appeal turns essentially on the 
						findings of fact the several grounds of appeal seeking 
						to challenge the conclusions reached by the learned 
						trial judge on the contested facts and therefore to 
						succeed the appellant has to show that the said findings 
						are not supported by the evidence or are unreasonable 
						and or perverse, the question here being not whether 
						this court is merely dissatisfied with the result of the 
						trial but also whether the verdict was such that no 
						reasonable man could have come to. See-(1) Byrant v 
						North Metropolitan Tramways Co. (1800), 6T.L.R. 396. In 
						his judgment, the learned trial judge of the High Court, 
						Kumasi determined all these questions in favour of the 
						respondents. In his complaint to this court, the 
						appellant seeks to have the said determinations reversed 
						and judgment entered in his favour. Since the attack is 
						directed at the said findings, I wish to examine how the 
						learned trial judge came to his conclusion on the said 
						facts. I commence first from the determination regarding 
						the disputed building. In his finding, the learned trial 
						judge patiently examined the rival versions placed 
						before him by the parties and after a careful 
						consideration of the probabilities in a manner which 
						impressed me came to the conclusion that the said house 
						was put up by the deceased brother of the appellant 
						herein. (See pages 157 to 165 of the record of 
						proceedings on which this appeal is based). In 
						particular, at page 165, he said and I quote:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;In this case there is 
						overwhelming evidence from which I draw the conclusion 
						that the disputed house belonged to the deceased and 
						that he so regarded the house as he exercised complete 
						dominion over it in his lifetime .The plaintiff's 
						contention that the house was built by the deceased with 
						proceeds from his pharmacy shop and the sale of his 
						vanguard saloon car is not believable. I do not accept 
						it .I find that the house was owned by the plaintiff in 
						the latter&#8217;s life time. &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As can be seen from the 
						said delivery, it was based on the effect of the 
						admitted evidence and since the conclusion is amply 
						supported by the evidence, I do not see any merit in the 
						attack on the said finding as can be read from the 
						several grounds of appeal touching and concerning the 
						same. But, quite apart from the correctness of the 
						finding relating to the house, I must point out that the 
						appellant's story which he put up in the court below was 
						incredulous. If it may be asked, if indeed the house was 
						his why did he have to leave the same and hire a place 
						to dwell in at a cost which at the time was quite 
						colossal? Again why did he not assert his claim to the 
						house against the deceased brother in his life time 
						notwithstanding his assertion that his brother had made 
						a concession to his claim at arbitration? Perhaps, I 
						might add why did the appellant not upon his return from 
						London take over the receipts of rental income from the 
						property and at least utilize the same in paying his 
						rents? Clearly, it was obvious from the conduct of the 
						appellant before the death of his brother that what he 
						subsequently asserted in court was a discredited story 
						particularly when one bears in mind that the said story 
						was being asserted after the death of his brother. I 
						think that in all probability the appellant knew that 
						the house was for his deceased brother a fact which 
						might tend to explain his conduct in the lifetime of the 
						brother. I also wish to note that whilst in his 
						pleadings the appellant averred that his deceased 
						brother was responsible for his education, in his 
						evidence he sought to change this by saying that he was 
						looked after by his mother and some other person. I 
						think that the said shift in his case was only intended 
						to throw dust into the eyes of the court but 
						unfortunately for him the learned trial judge was alive 
						to his responsibilities and came to the right 
						conclusion.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I now turn my attention 
						my lords to the finding regarding the disputed cocoa 
						farm and wish to say that the said finding cannot be 
						faulted. I think that on the admitted evidence, the 
						learned trial judge of the court below could not have 
						come to any other conclusion for there was unchallenged 
						evidence of the deceased&#8217;s control which he exercised 
						over the farm and in particular the agreements which in 
						his life time subsisted between him and those who 
						cultivated the farm for him. I think clearly that in the 
						circumstances, the finding in respect of the said farm 
						was right having been arrived at after a careful 
						consideration and I desire not to intervene by setting 
						the same aside. To do as contended by the appellant 
						would be to do injustice to the effect of the evidence 
						which is contained in the record before us. In my view 
						therefore the learned judge&#8217;s conclusions on the issues 
						which arose before him in the court below are amply 
						supported by the evidence. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This conclusion, in my 
						view effectively disposes of the appeal herein the 
						result being that the appeal fails in its entirety. But; 
						before I put this delivery to a rest permit me my lords, 
						to detain the precious time of this court by referring 
						to a procedural irregularity which I noted in the record 
						before us. It relates to the tendering of evidence by 
						the appellant who was the plaintiff in the court below 
						after the respondent (the defendant in the court below) 
						had concluded his evidence on the counterclaim. Before 
						then, the appellant had testified and after calling two 
						witnesses he applied for leave to discontinue his case 
						against the respondents following which the respondents 
						went to prove their claim as contained in the 
						counterclaim. In my view, the learned trial judge erred 
						when he permitted the appellant to give evidence in 
						rebuttal of the counterclaim for in his evidence and 
						that of his witnesses he ought to have adverted his mind 
						not only to his claim but that contained in the 
						counterclaim and for that matter it was of no moment 
						that he had discontinued his claim the said 
						discontinuance not having any effect on the evidence 
						which they had led in proof not only of their claim but&nbsp; 
						also in rebuttal of the counterclaim. Therefore, in my 
						thinking the evidence which the appellant was enabled to 
						introduce thereafter was wrongly received and should be 
						expunged from the record else it would amount to 
						affording him a double opportunity to state his case. I 
						believe that he was legitimately only entitled to cross 
						examine the respondents and their witnesses and no more. 
						I have doubts after a careful reading of the record 
						whether the said indulgence which was wrongly granted to 
						him did not enable him to improve upon his case as 
						previously narrated in his evidence in chief. 
						Accordingly, in my deliberation in keeping with the 
						settled opinion in such cases I did not have regard to 
						the said improperly received evidence but limited myself 
						only to the evidence before the discontinuance and that 
						of the respondents. It being so, I direct that the 
						evidence of the appellant and his witnesses appearing at 
						pages 109 to 132 of the record&nbsp; be and are hereby 
						expunged .The result as indicated earlier on in the 
						course of this judgment is that the appeal herein is 
						dismissed and the judgment of the court below allowing 
						the respondent&#8217;s counterclaim is hereby affirmed.</span></p>
