						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">By paragraph 3 of his 
						Statement of Claim the respondent to this appeal averred 
						that on the 5th January, 1991 he purchased a piece of 
						land at East Legon and obtained a Land Title Certificate 
						No. GA 8989 Vol. 54 Folio 106 with an approximate area 
						of 0.298. The respondent claimed that he purchased the 
						land from a family called &quot;Wofa Trebi Family&quot; of Teshie 
						Lenshie whose head of family was one Ebenezer Afutu. The 
						respondent admitted in cross-examination that he 
						appointed one Captain George Acquah to act for him in 
						all matters affecting the land, but denied instructing 
						the said Acquah to sell the land. When respondent was 
						asked in cross-examination as to whether he conducted a 
						search at the Lands Valuation Board his answer was as 
						follows:&#8212; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Yes. But I was told 
						the land belonged to Obodaifio who gave same to 
						Defendant. There was judgment in a dispute over the land 
						and there had to be a Deed of Surrender giving the land 
						to Afutu.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q:&nbsp; You were not given 
						a report</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A:&nbsp;&nbsp; No.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The respondent stated 
						that he purchased two plots and that only one of the two 
						was in dispute before the court. The cross-examination 
						of the respondent continued as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q: When the dispute 
						started Afutu informed Captain Acquah that the 
						defendants are the rightful owners?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A: Not correct. I am 
						not aware of that.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q: I am suggesting to 
						you that Afutu gave another plot to your brother through 
						Captain Acquah?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A: I am not aware of 
						that.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It appears from the 
						record that the instant witness referred to as 
						respondent was giving evidence as the holder of a power 
						of attorney from the real purchaser/plaintiff in the 
						action. The claim made by the appellant was that at the 
						time the respondent took steps to process his title to 
						the land at the Land Title Registration Department, he 
						was fully aware that the land had been sold to one Yaw 
						Darko and title had been vested in the said Darko from 
						whom they derived title by a deed of assignment, 
						claiming further that the said Darko acquired the land 
						from the Obodae family of Accra. PW1 testifying on 
						behalf of the respondent stated at page 72 of the record 
						of appeal and this averment had not been challenged by 
						the appellants over the true ownership of the land, the 
						Obodae family had lost the disputed land to the Wofa 
						Trebi family headed by Afutu afore-mentioned and that 
						the said Afutu had asked the appellants to attorn tenant 
						to the Wofa Trebi Family and they had complied and paid 
						for all expenses and the costs of all things including 
						cement blocks and fence wall erected on the land by or 
						on behalf of the respondent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In his judgment the 
						learned trial Judge, just held the view that the Wofa 
						Trebi Family headed by Afutu had at the time it 
						purported to grant the disputed land to the appellants, 
						the respondent had already purchased the land from the 
						same family and therefore the transaction infringed the 
						legal maxim &quot;nemo dat quod non habet&quot;, and consequently 
						was void and of no legal effect. The hottest ground of 
						appeal argued by the appellant's Counsel was that the 
						learned trial judge erred in his finding that the Obodae 
						family lost title to the land to the Wofa Trebi family 
						in the absence of positive evidence of the alleged 
						judgment. Counsel submitted that if there was no 
						judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the 
						alleged setting aside of the title of the appellant to 
						his land would have been unsupported in law.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Although there was no 
						paragraph in the pleadings where any judgment could be 
						found and no issue of fact arose about it in the Summons 
						for Directions. As I have already stated in this 
						judgment, a witness of the respondent, PW1, testified to 
						the effect that the Obodae family from whom the grantors 
						of the appellants claimed title lost such title in a 
						court case to the Wofa Trebi family who sold the land to 
						the respondent. Since this piece of unpleaded evidence 
						was not objected to by Counsel for the appellants, the 
						learned trial judge took it into consideration. He 
						therefore concluded that since the appellants 
						regularised their title at a time subsequent to the time 
						the respondent purchased the land from the Wofa Trebi 
						Family that transaction was ineffective and could not 
						pass title. The position notwithstanding, I have been 
						unable to reconcile with my mind on the issue about this 
						controversial judgment. The reason is that PW1 who spoke 
						of this judgment stated that it was Afutu who told him 
						that there had been a court case in which a judgment had 
						been delivered against the Obadae Family. Also it was 
						this same Afutu man who according to the appellants 
						asked them to regularise their title which they did by 
						making certain payments to attorn tenant to his family 
						and to settle expenses made by the respondent's agent 
						Captain Acquah even though the respondent denied having 
						authorized any such agency work by the Captain. The 
						question that bothers my mind is:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">How could Afutu give 
						land to the respondent, assist him to register its title 
						at the Lands Title Registration Office for a certificate 
						and ask the appellants to regularise their title to the 
						same land? I am therefore persuaded by the submissions 
						of Counsel for the appellants that the judgment 
						delivered by the trial judge in the instant case left 
						vital issues unanswered and they are:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(i) Is the land given 
						by Afutu to the plaintiff the same as the land George 
						Darko assigned to the Defendant?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(ii) Has any court ever 
						adjudicated on any dispute affecting the land?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(iii) Was there any 
						judgment as alleged by Afutu.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(iv) Was there any 
						surrender of title executed after the judgment? </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">These questions need 
						urgent answers because although PW1 said he had tendered 
						the controversial judgment nothing on the record of 
						appeal supports this claim and at the hearing of this 
						appeal we have not seen any judgment exhibit having been 
						tendered at the trial. For the forgiving reasons I hold 
						the views that the trial was unsatisfactory. The appeal 
						is allowed. The judgment of the court below is hereby 
						set aside.</span></p>
