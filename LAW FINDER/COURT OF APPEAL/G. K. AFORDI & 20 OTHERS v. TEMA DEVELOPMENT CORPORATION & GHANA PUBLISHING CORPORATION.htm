						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 
						plaintiffs/appellants (hereinafter referred to as the 
						appellants) who were former employees of Ghana 
						Publishing Corporation, began an action in the High 
						Court against the 1st defendant/respondent Tema 
						Development Corporation (hereinafter referred to as TDC) 
						and their former employer the 2nd defendant/respondent 
						(herein after referred to as the 2nd respondent), 
						claiming:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">a) A declaration of

						being in Tema in the Greater Accra Region of the

						<span style="font-family: Arial">c) Costs.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The facts of their 
						claim would be sufficiently set out in the course of the 
						judgment. The 2nd respondent denied the appellants&#8217; 
						claim. They claimed ownership of the said houses and 
						therefore couterclaimed for&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">a) An order setting 
						aside the lease executed for the plaintiffs by 1st 
						defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">b) A declaration of

						<span style="font-family: Arial">d) An order against the 
						1st defendant to execute leases in respect of the 
						aforesaid properties to 2nd defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellants by their 
						statement of claim averred that in or about 1968, their 
						employer, the 2nd respondent herein, applied for a 
						number of houses from TDC for its employees including 
						the appellants. The appellants were allocated the houses 
						listed against their names in the statement of claim. As 
						a result of the allocation of the said houses the 2nd 
						respondent withheld their housing allowance of 20% of 
						their respective salaries. They claimed these allowances 
						were retained to pay for the acquisition of the houses 
						acquired from TDC. They claimed that by a directive 
						dated 24th August 1979 and issued by a housing committee 
						set up by the erstwhile AFRC regime; the 2nd respondent 
						was to pay the plaintiffs their housing allowance to 
						enable them to pay rent directly to TDC. This was 
						complied with and TDC issued them with rent cards.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiffs claimed 
						they had since then paid rent directly to TDC. Between 
						April 1989 and September 1990 TDC informed them that 
						they had completed payment of the selling price of the 
						said houses and requested them to pay ground rents. TDC 
						had since then granted them leases, which have or are in 
						the process of being executed. The appellants averred 
						that the 2nd respondent is claiming ownership of the 
						houses and had been harassing them to quit and hence 
						this action.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">TDC by its statement of 
						defence admitted that the 2nd respondent applied for a 
						number of houses for the occupation of its employees. It 
						admitted that following the AFRC directives the 
						appellants were given their housing allowance to 
						facilitate the direct payment of rent to TDC. It however 
						claimed this AFRC directives applied to rental units and 
						not to houses under House Ownership Scheme. TDC 
						contended that though the appellants made payments in 
						respect of these houses, these were made in error as the 
						2nd respondent had already completed payments of the 
						said houses.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 2nd respondent in a 
						rather terse statement of defence denied the plaintiffs 
						claim and claimed it was the owner of the said houses.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Judgment was given in 
						favour of the 2nd respondent and the appellants being 
						dissatisfied appealed on several grounds which I need 
						not set out herein extenso. I would rather spelt them 
						out when considered in the course of the judgment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At the trial the 
						appellants rested their case on the evidence given by 
						the 1st and the 20th appellants only. Relevant portions 
						of the 1st appellant&#8217;s evidence was that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8216;&#8216;In July 1969,TDC (1st 
						defendant herein) allocated a house to me through my 
						employers, the Ghana Publishing Corporation. The 1st 
						defendant is the one who erected those houses. In August 
						1969&#8217; there was an order from the Busia Government &#8230;that 
						the houses be transferred to the occupants. I did apply 
						in respect of mine but I was denied this- my application 
						was not accepted. Thus I continued to remain in the 
						house as a tenant of TDC&#8230;In 1979 I appealed through my 
						employers to the 1st defendant that the house be 
						allocated to me. It was later allocated to me. This was 
						after I have appeared before the AFRC &#8216;&#8216;one man one 
						house committee.&#8217;&#8217;&#8230;From 1969 I was paying rents and I 
						continued to do so after appearing before the AFRC 
						committee in 1979. On 29/3/90 the TDC wrote to me 
						informing that I had completed payment of the purchase 
						price and interest thereon&#8230;. After this I applied for a 
						document to bear out my purchase. I have before me a 
						copy of the leasehold agreement. &#8230;. I have been paying 
						the ground rent in respect of the property.&#8217;&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 20th appellant&#8217;s 
						evidence was slightly different. He said:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8216;&#8216; The said house was 
						allocated to me by the 1st defendant. When the 
						allocation was made to me I was given a rent card, which 
						was issued, to me in 1969. Later on I received a letter 
						from the 1st defendant saying that I had completed 
						payment&#8230;. Further on I received a lease from the 1st 
						defendant dated 13/13/88&#8230;. I pay the ground rent of the 
						premises&#8230;&#8217;&#8217; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 1st appellant&#8217;s 
						evidence shows that before the AFRC directives of 1980 
						he was living in the house by virtue of an allocation by 
						TDC through his employer in July 1969. An attempt to 
						have the house in his name in August of the same year 
						failed. It was his employer who was paying the rent. It 
						was only after the AFRC directives that he was given a 
						rent card to pay the rent directly and also enjoy his 
						housing allowance, which was obviously higher than the 
						rent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 20th appellant&#8217;s 
						evidence on the other hand created the impression that 
						he was directly given the allocation in his own right 
						and given a rent card that same year. He tendered this 
						rent card as Exhibit &#8216;D&#8217;. A look at this rent card does 
						not show the date on which it was issued. But it shows 
						that the record of payment started on 27 August 1980. 
						This may well be at the time that the AFRC directives 
						were given. See Exhibit &#8216;2D2&#8217;. So that the 20th 
						appellant&#8217;s evidence that he was allocated the house by 
						TDC and given a rent card in 1969 cannot be true. </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellants on the 
						other hand in their respective evidence given on their 
						behalf said these houses were in 1969 offered on sale to 
						the 2nd respondent by TDC. The 2nd respondent paid an 
						initial deposit and was given 44 houses, which included 
						those in dispute. The 2nd respondent continued to make 
						payment by instalment until they finished payment on 19 
						June 1983. Exhibits 1 and 2 were tendered in evidence as 
						proof of the offer and the initial payment. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The evidence of the 
						respondents therefore clearly shows that the said houses 
						were not rental units but houses which had been offered 
						to the 2nd respondent and who had accepted the offer and 
						paid for them by instalments. It is also obvious that 
						the appellants were not paid any housing allowance 
						simply because they were living in premises offered by 
						their employer. The appellants never challenged the 2nd 
						respondent&#8217;s evidence that it had paid for the houses. I 
						am therefore of the view that it was wrong to apply the 
						AFRC directives to these houses, as on the evidence they 
						were not rental units but houses bought and paid for by 
						the 2nd&nbsp; respondent. For this reasons alone the appeal 
						fails.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">However there are other 
						issues to be considered. One is the issue faced by the 
						trial judge of the relevance of the rent card on which 
						the appellants hinged their case and the present appeal 
						as well. Counsel for the appellants contended that:
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8216;&#8216;The rent card Exhibit 
						&#8216;D&#8217; was a complete contract between the plaintiffs and 
						the 1st defendants. It sets out the number of the house, 
						the selling price, monthly instalment and the date of 
						the commencement of the lease the period of the lease 
						and period of payment. It is a complete Hire Purchase 
						Agreement. No offer and acceptance is needed to complete 
						the agreement of the sale of the said houses by the 1st 
						defendant to plaintiffs.&#8217;&#8217;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Upon an examination of 
						Exhibit &#8216;D&#8217; which was tendered as the rent card which 
						counsel claimed was issued as a result of the AFRC 
						directives of 1980 although the 20th appellant said it 
						was given him in 1969, I find that it is not a rent card 
						but rather a hire purchase scheme with the period of the 
						lease, the selling price of the house with interest and 
						a record of payments. This in all respects is not a rent 
						card as envisaged by the said directives. No wonder when 
						the appellants completed payment based on Exhibit &#8216;D&#8217;, 
						they were offered leases on the houses.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial judge 
						however, in his judgment found this offer of leasehold 
						to the appellants to be invalid. This holding gave rise 
						to one of the additional grounds of appeal that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8216;&#8217;The trial judge erred 
						in law when he stated in his judgment that&#8217; I have no 
						doubt that they, the plaintiffs, could not at law have a 
						valid offer made to them except this was acquiesced in 
						by the 2nd defendant at a time contemporaneous with the 
						said offer.&#8217;&#8217; </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel&#8217;s argument was 
						that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8216;&#8216;With the issuance of 
						the rent card by 1st defendants to plaintiffs under the 
						house ownership of 1st defendants and the creation of a 
						hire purchase agreement between the plaintiffs and 1st 
						defendants the question of offer and acceptance does not 
						arise at all in relation to the purchase of the said 
						houses by the plaintiffs.&#8217;&#8217;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is my candid opinion 
						that Counsel&#8217;s argument does not take into consideration 
						the evidence of an already existing contract of sale of 
						the said houses between TDC and the 2nd respondent in 
						1969 before the issue of the rent cards in 1980. Even if 
						the 2nd respondent had not finished payment by 1980, yet 
						as rightly pointed out by the trial judge from the 
						moment the contract was concluded the 2nd defendant at 
						equity became the owner and the 1st defendant its 
						constructive trustee of the properties the subject 
						matter of the sale. This position is supported in 
						Snell&#8217;s Principles of Equity (27thEd.) at page 188, 
						which states as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8216;&#8216;As soon as a 
						specifically enforceable contract for sale of land is 
						made, the purchaser becomes the owner of the land in 
						equity and the vendor becomes a constructive trustee of 
						the land for the purchaser subject in each case to their 
						respective rights and duties under the contract.&#8217;&#8217;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This being the case TDC 
						had no right to grant leaseholds to the appellants. The 
						Supreme Court in the case of Amuzu vrs Oklikah [1998-99] 
						SCGLR 141 per Aikins JSC at 152 stated that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8216;&#8216;The law is also clear 
						that upon entering into such clear valid contract for 
						sale, the court will not allow the vendor to transfer 
						afterwards the legal estate to a third person, though 
						such person would be affected by his pendens. The 
						property is in such a situation (in equity) transferred 
						to the purchaser by the contract, and the vendor will 
						not be permitted to deal with the property so as to 
						inconvenience him.&#8217;&#8217;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As said earlier 
						Exhibits 1&amp;2 clearly showed that the houses were sold to 
						the 2nd appellant and were therefore not rental units. 
						It was therefore wrong to apply the AFRC directives to 
						these houses and for TDC to collect rents from the 
						appellants. The appellants were also not entitled to 
						housing allowance while living in premises provided by 
						their employers. The application of these directives in 
						the instant case is an indication of the over 
						zealousness of officialdom to comply with revolutionary 
						measures without considering its legality during that 
						erstwhile regime, that has led to this action. </span>

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellants have not 
						been able to convince this court that the judgment is 
						wrong. For the reasons given above the appeal fails and 
						ought to be dismissed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appeal is therefore 
						dismissed.</span></p>
