						<span style="font-family: Arial">JUDGMENT</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;WOOD, JA.:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I agree with my learned 
						brother that the appeal should succeed. The Respondent 
						endorsed his writ for a number of reliefs including &quot;an 
						order for plaintiff's reinstatement or in lien ¢20 
						million compensation to be paid to the plaintiff for his 
						wrongful dismissal&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The argument advanced 
						in support of the additional ground (1) is that in so 
						far as the amount claimed as compensation exceeded the 
						statutory limit of ¢10m as provided for under S.41 of 
						the Courts Act 1993, [Act 459], the Circuit Court which 
						tried the action lacked jurisdiction. The corrolary of 
						this argument was that the judgment was a nullity and 
						must be vacated.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Respondent counsel has 
						on the other hand given four main reasons why this 
						ground of appeal must fail. First, it was contented that 
						the ¢20m claim was merely an ancillary relief. But quite 
						clearly, the statutory limit of ¢10m applies to all 
						personal actions arising under tort or contract or 
						actions for the recovery of liquidated sums. The act 
						does not stipulate either expressly or by necessary 
						implication that ancillary reliefs are nevertheless 
						excluded, even though the amount claimed in respect of 
						such ancillary relief exceeds the statutory limit. It is 
						indeed inconceivable that any such exemptions would be 
						created. In any case the relief as endorsed is not an 
						ancillary or secondary relief. It is alternate to the 
						order for reinstatement.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The second argument is 
						that both parties as well as the trial judge treated 
						this claim as one for general damages. Allied to this 
						is, the third contention that in any case, the 
						compensation awarded at the conclusion of the trial, 
						fell far below the limit of the court's jurisdiction. 
						These arguments, to my mind are untenable. It is 
						important that our courts keep within the limits of 
						their jurisdiction. Indeed, lack of jurisdiction is one 
						of the most serious charges that can be leveled against 
						any court or tribunal. It is fundamental and questions 
						the authority of that court or tribunal to adjudicate on 
						the matters concerned, in this instant case, the claim 
						by the respondent that he is entitled to ¢20m by way of 
						compensation for the wrong suffered. A plain reading of 
						the S.14 of Act 459, shows that what determines the 
						circuit court's jurisdiction is not the quantum of an 
						award in any given case, but rather the amount claimed 
						as endorsed on the writ. Thus, even where the question 
						of jurisdiction is raised for the first time on appeal, 
						the test remains the same. It is not the quantum of 
						damages eventually awarded, by the court but the amount 
						claimed in the action in contract, tort or for the 
						recovery of the liquidated sum. Where the amount so 
						claimed is in excess of ¢10m, the court lacked 
						jurisdiction in the first place, notwithstanding the 
						fact that it awarded a lesser sum. The courts 
						jurisdiction having been clearly subscribed by statute 
						the least the court could have done for the parties was 
						to have raised it so that with their express consent and 
						properly recorded in the proceedings, the court could 
						have proceeded to determine the claim. As things stand 
						now the court erred in assuming jurisdiction as far as 
						the relief for compensation is concerned.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The fourth and perhaps 
						the more serious submission is that the appellant 
						counsel never considered the jurisdictional issue else 
						he would have raised it at the earliest opportunity, in 
						the court below. I do agree that the interest of parties 
						are better served when jurisdictional issues are raised 
						and dealt with one way or the other, at the earliest 
						opportunity.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The general rule is 
						that points of law relied on in appeal hearings, must be 
						those raised at the trial and which were wrongfully 
						decided upon. Thus, an appellant ought not to be heard 
						on question of law which were open to him/her on the 
						state of the pleadings but which he failed to take 
						advantage of. Our courts have however created exceptions 
						to these broad principles. Akuffo Addo v. Quanshie ldun 
						[1968] GLR 667 AG Lavendoswky and Base Group [1971] 2 
						GLR The more recent authority is Food Specialties Ltd v. 
						Ramia [1989-90] 2 GLR where Adade JSC said:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;I concede that this 
						point was not taken by either the appellant or the 
						respondent. But as it is a point of law, this court can 
						take it any time notwithstanding the fact that it was 
						not raised we have done that many times in this court.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The question of 
						jurisdiction is yet another exception can be taken or 
						raised even on appeal Eboe v. Eboe [1961] 1 GLR 324.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The claim for ¢20m took 
						this case out of the jurisdiction of the court. 
						Regrettably the proper step we ought to take on this 
						appeal is to declare the trial a nullity and set the 
						judgment aside.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">JUSTICE OF APPEAL</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">FARKYE, JA.:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This judgment is in 
						respect of an appeal against the judgment of the Circuit 
						Court Accra dated 16th day of May, 2000.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this suit, the 
						plaintiff/respondent issued out a writ of summons on 
						11/12/97 claiming against the Defendant/appellant the 
						following:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1) An order of the 
						Court declaring the purported dismissal of the plaintiff 
						a wrongful act.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) An order for

						compensation to be paid to Plaintiff for his wrongful 
						dismissal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(3) Payment of end of 
						service benefits</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(4) General damages.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 
						Plaintiff/Respondent was an employee of the 
						Defendant/appellant as a security officer from 1/10/92 
						up to 1/9/97.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On 24/8/1997, while the 
						Plaintiff/respondent was on night duty some thieves 
						broke into the office of the Managing Director and four 
						other offices in two floors of the main office building 
						and the factory offices.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The thieves stole hand 
						calculators, a radio and a wall clock. The 
						Plaintiff/respondent was summarily dismissed after the 
						theft at the factory. The Plaintiff/respondent then 
						issued the writ of summons claiming what has been stated 
						above.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After the trial 
						judgment was given by the Circuit Court for the 
						Plaintiff/Respondent against the Defendant/appellant 
						hence this appeal. Learned counsel for the 
						Defendant/appellant filed four grounds of appeal at 
						first which are as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) The judgment is 
						against the weight of the evidence</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) The learned trial 
						judge failed to look at the evidence before him in its 
						entirety and thereby arrived at a wrong conclusion on 
						the question of liability.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) The Learned trial 
						judge erred in awarding general damages in a wrongful 
						dismissal suit.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d) The compensation 
						awarded is not only excessive but unknown to the law 
						relating to wrongful dismissal suit.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Later the Learned 
						Counsel for the Defendant/appellant filed additional 
						ground 1 of the Notice of Appeal which reads as 
						follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The trial Court had no 
						jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff's case at all the 
						claim being in excess of ¢10,000,000.00&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I shall first deal with 
						the additional aground 1 of the Notice of Appeal dealing 
						with the jurisdiction of the Court. After dealing with 
						the jurisdiction of the Court it may not be necessary 
						for me to deal with the other grounds of appeal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Section 41(1)(a)(i) of 
						the Court Act 1993 (Act 459) states that the 
						jurisdiction of Circuit Court shall consist of the 
						following:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) Original 
						jurisdiction in civil matter:&#8212; (1) in all personal 
						action arising under contract or tort or for the 
						recovery of any liquidated sum which the amount claimed 
						is not more than 10 million cedis.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this suit the 2nd 
						claim of the Plaintiff/appellant was as follows:&#8212;&quot;An 
						order for Plaintiff's reinstatement or in lien ¢20 
						million compensation to be paid to the plaintiff for his 
						wrongful dismissal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">My understanding of 
						this claim is that the Plaintiff/respondent wanted the 
						Circuit Court to order the Defendant/Appellant to 
						reinstate him as a security officer in the 
						Defendant/Appellant's company in lien ¢20,000,000.00.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 
						Plaintiff/respondent wanted the Circuit Court to grant 
						him ¢20,000,000.00 which comes under the recovery of 
						liquidated sum which is above ¢10,000,000.00.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this regard the 
						claim of the Plaintiff/Respondent is well above the 
						jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. The jurisdiction of 
						the Circuit Court is a question of law as Act 459 has 
						stated it. A question of law can be raised at any stage 
						of a trial.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Therefore the learned 
						counsel for the Defendant/appellant could raise the 
						question of jurisdiction at the Court of Appeal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Since the amount of 
						¢20,000,000.00 was above the jurisdiction of the Circuit 
						Court, it is not necessary for me to deal with the other 
						grounds of appeal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appeal is 
						accordingly granted. The judgment of the Circuit Court 
						delivered on the 6th day of May 2000 is vacated.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">No order as to costs.</span></p>

						<span style="font-family: Arial">This judgment is in 
						respect of an appeal against the judgment of the Circuit 
						Court Accra dated 16th day of May, 2000.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this suit, the 
						plaintiff/respondent issued out a writ of summons on 
						11/12/97 claiming against the Defendant/appellant the 
						following:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(5) An order of the 
						Court declaring the purported dismissal of the Plaintiff 
						a wrongful act.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(6) An order for 
						Plaintiff's reinstatement or in lien ¢20million 
						compensation to be paid to Plaintiff for his wrongful 
						dismissal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(7) Payment of end of 
						service benefits</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(8) General damages.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 
						Plaintiff/Respondent was an employee of the 
						Defendant/appellant as a security officer from 1/10/92 
						up to 1/9/97.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On 24/8/1997, while the 
						Plaintiff/respondent was on night duty some thieves 
						broke into the office of the Managing Director and four 
						other offices in two floors of the main office building 
						and the factory offices.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The thieves stole hand 
						calculators, a radio and a wall clock. The 
						Plaintiff/respondent was summarily dismissed after the 
						theft at the factory. The Plaintiff/respondent then 
						issued the writ of summons claiming what has been stated 
						above.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After the trial 
						judgment was given by the Circuit Court for the 
						Plaintiff/Respondent against the Defendant/appellant 
						hence this appeal. Learned counsel for the 
						Defendant/appellant filed four grounds of appeal at 
						first which are as follows:&#8212;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(e) The judgment is 
						against the weight of the evidence</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(f) The learned trial 
						judge failed to look at the evidence before him in its 
						entirety and thereby arrived at a wrong conclusion on 
						the question of liability.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(g) The Learned trial 
						judge erred in awarding general damages in a wrongful 
						dismissal suit.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(h) The compensation 
						awarded is not only excessive but unknown to the law 
						relating to wrongful dismissal suit.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Later the Learned 
						Counsel for the Defendant/appellant filed additional 
						ground 1 of the Notice of Appeal which reads as 
						follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The trial Court had no 
						jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff's case at all the 
						claim being in excess of ¢10,000,000.00&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I shall first deal with 
						the additional aground 1 of the Notice of Appeal dealing 
						with the jurisdiction of the Court. After dealing with 
						the jurisdiction of the Court it may not be necessary 
						for me to deal with the other grounds of appeal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Section 41(1)(a)(i) of 
						the Courts Act 1993 (Act 459) states that the 
						jurisdiction of Circuit Court shall consist of the 
						following:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) Original 
						jurisdiction in civil matters &#8212; (1) in all personal 
						action arising under contract or tort or for the 
						recovery of any liquidated sum which the amount claimed 
						is not more than 10 million cedis.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this suit the 2nd 
						claim of the Plaintiff/appellant was as follows:&#8212;&quot;An 
						order for Plaintiff's reinstatement or in lien ¢20 
						million compensation to be paid to the plaintiff for his 
						wrongful dismissal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">My understanding of 
						this claim is that the Plaintiff/Respondent wanted the 
						Circuit Court to order the Defendant/Appellant to 
						reinstate him as a security officer in the 
						Defendant/Appellant's company in lien ¢20,000,000.00.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 
						Plaintiff/respondent wanted the Circuit Court to grant 
						him ¢20,000,000.00 which comes under the recovery of the 
						sum which is above 
						¢10,000,000.00.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this regard the 
						claim of the Plaintiff/Respondent is well above the 
						jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. The jurisdiction of 
						the Circuit Court is a question of law as Act 459 has 
						stated it. A question of law can be raised at any stage 
						of a trial.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Therefore the learned 
						counsel for the Defendant/appellant could raise the 
						question of law dealing with jurisdiction at the Court 
						of Appeal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Since the amount of 
						¢20,000,000.00 was above the jurisdiction of the Circuit 
						Court, it is not necessary for me to deal with the other 
						grounds of appeal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appeal is 
						accordingly granted. The judgment of the Circuit Court 
						delivered on the 6th day of May 2000 is vacated.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">No order as to costs.</span></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">ROSE OWUSU:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I also agree that the 
						trial Circuit Court had no Jurisdiction in entertaining 
						the Respondent's action which among other reliefs 
						claimed 20 million cedis compensation for the 
						Respondent's wrongful dismissal in lieu of an order for 
						Respondent's reinstatement.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In effect, the 
						Respondent was claiming ¢20 million compensation if the 
						Court refused to order his reinstatement as it indeed 
						did in this case.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This issue of 
						jurisdiction was not raised at the trial but this does 
						not stop the Appellant from doing so now. As an issue of 
						Law, it can indeed be raised in this court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The facts of the case 
						have been sufficiently set out in the judgment of my 
						brother and I do not intend going over same.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The notice of appeal 
						filed after the trial, stated four grounds which I do 
						not intend to go over as the conclusion arrived at, that 
						the trial judge had no jurisdiction to entertain the 
						action makes it unnecessary even to touch on them. 
						Counsel for the Appellant on 22/3/2001 filed three 
						additional grounds, ground 1 of which reads as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1. &quot;The trial court had 
						no jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff's case at all, the 
						claim being in excess of ¢10,000,000.00. In his 
						statement of case, he argued this ground first.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel submitted that 
						this claim is separate and apart from one far general 
						damages endorsed on the writ.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Circuit court being 
						a lower court has no jurisdiction except that which is 
						expressly conferred on it by statute. See the case of 
						HAUSA VRS. DAWUDA [1961] 2 GLR 550 and the recent one of 
						DISTRICT COURT GD 1, DUNKWA-ON-OFFIN, EX-PARTE: OWUSU 
						[1991] 1 GLR 136 in which the court referred to dictum 
						of Coussey JA. in the case of Timitimi vrs. AMABEBE 
						[1953] 14 WACA 374 at 376.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The jurisdiction, 
						conferred on the Circuit court under section 41 (1) of 
						the Court Act 1993 (Act 459) consists of the following:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) &quot;original 
						Jurisdiction in civil matters&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(i) &quot;in all personal 
						actions arising under contract or tort or for the 
						recovery of own liquidated sum, where the amount claimed 
						is not more than ¢10,000,000.00.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the Circuit Court 
						the Respondent's claim arose under his contract of 
						employment and the amount claimed was ¢20,000,000.00 
						compensation in lieu of his claim for an order for 
						reinstatement.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I am unable to agree 
						with counsel for the Respondent that this claim is not a 
						specific claim but a general request for compensation. 
						In that case, why did he not ask for compensation 
						simpliciter without tagging it to a specific sum of 
						money?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The fact that the final 
						award made by the court falls within the ¢10,000,000.00 
						limit of the court would not clothe it with the 
						Jurisdiction which it lacked from the beginning. The 
						determining factor is the amount claimed and not the 
						award made (emphasis is mine).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The issue being raised 
						in this appeal is a serious legal one. Jurisdiction 
						cannot be conferred by presumption or implication. It 
						can only be conferred by an agreement of the parties as 
						stated under section 41(3) of the court Act 1993 (Act 
						459) which reads as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot; where the amount 
						claimed or the value of any land or property exceeds the 
						amount or value specified in subsection (1) of this 
						section, the Circuit Court shall, notwithstanding that 
						subsection, proceed to hear the case if the parties 
						agree that it should do so&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this case, there was 
						no such agreement.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The claim for 
						¢20,000,000.00 took the plaintiff&#8217;s action out of the 
						jurisdictional realm of the Circuit Court. Consequently 
						the whole trial before the Circuit Court was a nullity 
						and same is hereby declared null and void for want of 
						Jurisdiction.</span></p>
