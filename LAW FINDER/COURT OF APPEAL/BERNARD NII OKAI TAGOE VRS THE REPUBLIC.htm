						<font face="Arial"><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp;The 
						appellant was found guilty of the murder of one Nii 
						Ardey Sackey by an Accra High Court presided over by Mr. 
						Justice B.T. Aryeetey sitting with a jury on 2nd 
						February 1990 and his sole ground of appeal to this 
						court from the conviction and sentence of death imposed 
						on him is that the verdict is unreasonable having regard 
						to the evidence. It must be noted this ground of appeal 
						was filed on 13th February 1990, a mere eleven days 
						after the appellant had been convicted and sentenced. 
						Subsequently the appellant filed two additional grounds 
						of appeal namely: (1) The jury was not properly directed 
						with regard to the disparity between the statement made 
						by PWI to the police and her evidence in court. (2) The 
						medical evidence is not conclusive of the cause of death 
						of the deceased.&quot; Apparently these additional grounds 
						were filed well out of time and without the leave of 
						court as they were dated the 18th day of February 2002, 
						twelve clear years after the conviction and sentence of 
						the appellant: Those grounds, therefore, donotmerit any 
						consideration in this appeal. The facts given in 
						evidence by the prosecution were based mainly on the eye 
						witness testimony of the fourth prosecution witness, 
						Elizabeth Mawushie Commey, who strangely at the trial 
						appeared reluctant to testify in support of the case for 
						the prosecution claiming that she had forgotten about 
						the incident that resulted in the death of the 
						deceased.According to the fourth prosecution witness (to 
						be referred to herein as PW4), she was a fishmonger who 
						was working at the seashore with the appellant but 
						because the appellant was stealing from her, she stopped 
						working with him and thereafter engaged the deceased to 
						work for her. She further testified that on the day of 
						the incident, the deceased gathered some boxes in order 
						to pack them. While the deceased was performing that 
						task, the appellant came there and tried to fight with 
						the deceased.PW4 separated them and advised them not to 
						fight. As the deceased was going away, the appellant 
						followed him. Later PW4 was informed that the deceased 
						and the appellant were fighting on top of a hill. She 
						went there and asked the appellant why he was still 
						fighting with the deceased following her advice to them 
						not to fight. The appellant was said to have replied 
						that if he did not kill the deceased, then the deceased 
						would kill him. Describing the scene where the fight 
						took place, PW4 said there were canoes there and the 
						deceased fell into one of the canoes. Then PW4 saw the 
						appellant hitting the head of the deceased on the canoe. 
						As the appellant resisted any attempt to separate him 
						and the deceased, PW4 left the scene. Two or three days 
						after the fight the deceased died. The medical doctor 
						called by the prosecution stated that the cause of death 
						was due to bleeding in or into the brain attributable to 
						a trauma such as something hitting the head in an 
						accident or a knock on the head by a heavy object; or 
						through disease like hypertension where a blood vessel 
						bursts in the brain such that there is bleeding into the 
						brain tissue. The appellant, who testified on oath, 
						stated that on 7th February 1986, he was in a canoe at 
						the seashore waiting for the afternoon catch of fish to 
						be brought in by the fishermen when the deceased came 
						there. The appellant narrated what on previous occasions 
						was happening between him and the deceased when a. catch 
						of fish came in. He said with the arrival of the 
						catch,the deceased would place his basket between the 
						appellant's basket and if some fish fell from a canoe, 
						it would land in the deceased's basket. Sometimes also 
						the deceased would remove the appellant's basket and put 
						his basket in place of that of the appellant. Later the 
						customers of both the deceased and the appellant decided 
						that any time some fish went into the deceased's basket, 
						he and the appellant should share the proceeds. With 
						this arrangement in place, the appellant and the 
						deceased shared the proceeds of the sale of any fish 
						each of them obtained. The appellant said on the day of 
						the incident, he was with his customer, one Odde in the 
						afternoon, when a 'canoe came in. As the appellant 
						rushed towards the canoe, the deceased came there and 
						the customer &quot;warned&quot; the appellant that it was through 
						the deceased that the appellant got to know the 
						customer; therefore anytime fish was shared, it should 
						be given to the deceased to go and sell and share the 
						proceeds with the appellant. When the appellant heard 
						this new arrangement, he was apparently unhappy with it 
						and hurled an insulting epithet at the deceased, to wit: 
						&quot;Onye&quot; (meaning, your mother) . The appellant then asked 
						the deceased whether he knew how he (appellant) had been 
						getting his goods or fish and how his (appellant's) 
						basket got to the seashore. The deceased retorted that 
						he would meet the appellant at the hilltop and followed 
						up by throwing his basket at the appellant who also 
						attempted to throw back his basket at the deceased. PW4, 
						Mawushie, however came between them and uttered a word 
						&quot;P00&quot; which was a word only used by the deceased and 
						PW4.Thereafter, the appellant was asked by his customer 
						to carry some boxes of fish into a room. PW4 also asked 
						the deceased to carry her boxes into the same room. The 
						appellant saw a friend of the deceased called Asitola in 
						the room. It seemed that Asitola had got wind of the 
						fracas between the appellant and the deceased and he 
						told the deceased to fight the appellant because the 
						appellant was not strong. Appellant was changing his 
						dress when he heard a voice behind him saying &quot;hit him 
						with it&quot;. The deceased hit the appellant with a metal 
						spoon used for frying and tore his dress. The appellant 
						removed his dress and gave it to the deceased to sew for 
						him. The deceased refused to accept the dress. The 
						appellant then drew nearer to the deceased and the 
						deceased tried to push him down. The deceased held the 
						legs of the appellant in an attempt to push him down and 
						the appellant also got the head of the deceased under 
						his armpit.As they were struggling,they both fell into a 
						broken canoe with their legs up in the air.People 
						watching them fight came and separated them.The 
						appellant and the deceased had sand in their mouths and 
						after the appellant had washed out the sand in his mouth 
						with sea water, the deceased told him to go and prepare 
						and come back. The appellant obliged and as he was 
						leaving for his house accompanied by a friend called 
						Allotey and the deceased, he heard a voice which turned 
						out to be that of PW4 saying, &quot;bite him&quot;.The deceased 
						held the dress of the appellant; pushed him and 
						attempted to give him a blow. The appellant managed to 
						hold the hand of the deceased as the deceased brought 
						his head to the chest of the appellant and bit him. The 
						appellant went to the police station to report that he 
						had been bitten by the deceased. He was treated at the 
						hospital for the bite wound and then taken into police 
						custody. Three days later, he heard that the deceased 
						had died but he found the news of his death unbelievable 
						because he had seen the deceased on the morning of his 
						death.On all the evidence including in all probability 
						the evidence of the doctor (PW3) that it was not normal 
						for a person of the age of the deceased (18 yeas) to be 
						hypertensive with the possibility of having a burst 
						blood vessel, and the eyewitness account of PW4 (who 
						inexplicably claimed she was suffering from a sudden 
						bout of amnesia) with regard to the events of 7th 
						February 1986, the appellant was found guilty of Murder 
						by the jury.I must, however, observe that given the 
						large number of people said to be present as the 
						appellant and the deceased were fighting in the canoe, 
						it was strange that none of those present, except PW4, 
						was invited to testify at the trial of the 
						appellant.Against his conviction and sentence the 
						appellant has appealed to this court on the sole ground 
						that:&quot;the verdict is unreasonable and cannot be 
						supported having regard to the evidence.&quot; It was 
						submitted on behalf of the appellant that it was the 
						deceased who first attacked him and there was no 
						evidence that the appellant intended to kill the 
						deceased nor did the prosecution lead evidence to show 
						that the appellant intended to kill the deceased. 
						Counsel for the appellant contended that the lack of 
						evidence to prove the ingredient of intention to kill 
						was fatal to the conviction and sentence of the 
						appellant for murder and that from the evidence adduced 
						the offence revealed was Manslaughter only and not 
						Murder in consequence of which the appellant should have 
						been discharged on the murder charge.Counsel for the 
						respondent submitted that there was a fight between the 
						deceased and the appellant which was unlawful by virtue 
						of Section 38 of the Criminal Code 1960 (Act 29) which 
						cannot be justified under the plea of self-defence and 
						therefore the reliance of the appellant on that plea 
						should be ignored as an afterthought.A careful reading 
						of the submissions of appellant's counsel would show 
						that the appellant is not relying so much on self-defence 
						as justification for fighting and consequently killing 
						the deceased as invoking the issue of whether intent to 
						kill as an ingredient of the crime of murder was 
						established on the evidence presented against him by the 
						prosecution. There was no doubt, in the circumstances of 
						this case that the appellant and the deceased engaged in 
						a fight which was unlawful within the meaning of 
						Sections 38 and 39 of Act 29. And even if the issue of 
						self-defence was not addressed by counsel for the 
						appellant in his submissions, that issue was adequately 
						considered by the learned trial judge in his summing up 
						when he stated as follows: &quot;Looking at the evidence, if 
						you come to the conclusion that the accused acted in 
						self- defence when he fought the deceased, the harm will 
						not be unlawful. If you come to the conclusion that the 
						harm was not unlawful, it would mean that one of the 
						five ingredients has not been satisfied and the Accused 
						will be entitled to be acquitted&quot;. The learned trial 
						judge also directed the jury on the ingredient of 
						intention. This is what he said on the issue: &quot;Finally, 
						members of the jury you are to look at the evidence and 
						come to a conclusion as to whether the unlawful harm was 
						caused intentionally. As the saying goes, &quot;Even the 
						devil knowest not the mind of man&quot;. Unless a person 
						makes his intention manifest by his expressed 
						declaration, his intention is in general inferred from 
						his acts (Section 11(1) and Section 11(2) of the 
						Criminal Code read). In other words, if you seize the 
						head of your friend and hit it against the floor 
						believing that that might cause his death, although you 
						may not intend to cause his death, if he dies, the law 
						presumes that you intended to cause his death because 
						nobody is in your head and nobody will know what you are 
						up to. Nobody may know that you did not intend to kill 
						that person.&quot; In SENE &amp; ANOR V. THE REPUBLIC (1977) 1GLR 
						434 at .436 - 437 C.A., Amissah J.A. held as follows: 
						&quot;The one important factor which distinguishes a case of 
						Murder from manslaughter is the intention. The element 
						of intent in a homicide resulting from a fight was 
						determihed.by considering whether from the circumstances 
						it could be said that the person who killed had the 
						intention to cause death as distinct from a mere 
						intention to fight. Such an intention might be inferred 
						from the instrument or weapon used in the killing or the 
						manner in which the harm which resulted was inflicted 
						.....&#8221; Now I find that the learned trial judge, rightly 
						in my view, adverted the minds of the jury to the 
						question of provocation such as the deceased throwing a 
						basket at the appellant and hitting him with a metal 
						frying spoon and tearing his shirt and the trial judge 
						asked the jury to consider whether those acts of the 
						deceased amounted to extreme provocation to the point of 
						the appellant losing his power of self-control. The 
						learned trial judge therefore clearly directed the jury 
						on all the possible defences available to the 
						appellant.While the learned trial judge's direction on 
						the law relating to intent to cause unlawful harm 
						resulting in death was unimpeachable, he left a gaping 
						hole in marrying the intention of the appellant to the 
						facts narrated by the appellant in his cautioned 
						statement and his sworn evidence. While the learned 
						trial judge conceded that the only person to give a 
						firsthand account of what sparked off the fight was the 
						appellant even as the prosecutions own and only 
						eyewitness (PW4) of the fight testified that she did 
						not' see the beginning of it, never at any time did the 
						appellant - not in his cautioned statement or his 
						evidence - state that he hit the head of the deceased on 
						a canoe.And yet the learned trial judge appeared to have 
						largely embraced and accepted the version of the 
						prosecution that the appellant hit the head of the 
						deceased against a canoe and so intended to kill the 
						deceased when he stressed in his summing up: &quot;As I was 
						saying, if you seize the head of your friend and hit it 
						against the floor you ought to appreciate that by so 
						doing, you intend to kill that person.&quot; It was indeed a 
						fact for the jury to find as noted by the learned trial 
						judge. But he ought necessarily to have juxtaposed the 
						story of the appellant, who never directly or in any 
						manner acknowledged or admitted that he hit the head of 
						the deceased against a canoe, and the version of the 
						prosecution to enable the jury arrive at a fitting and 
						reasonable finding as to whether the appellant intended 
						to kill the deceased or not. The learned trial judge 
						failed to do that and I think that was unsatisfactory 
						and amounted to a misdirection. The evidence of the 
						appellant that he and the deceased fell into a canoe 
						found corroboration in the testimony of Pw4. The 
						appellant stated that he and the deceased fell head 
						first into the canoe as they were fighting with their 
						legs in the air. It may very well be that the deceased 
						hit his head against the canoe thus injuring himself 
						when he first fell headlong into it and that it was this 
						which contributed to cause his death. The case of the 
						prosecution was further undermined by the fact that it 
						was not the same doctor who conducted a pathological 
						examination of the deceased who tendered the post-mortem 
						report on the deceased. The report was presented by the 
						prosecution through a different doctor who was not a 
						Pathologist and who never examined the body of the 
						deceased. And the report was not subjected to any 
						serious cross-examination or at all.In his inadequate 
						treatment of the element of intent in relation to the 
						testimony of the appellant, the learned trial judge fell 
						short in his otherwise diligent and Admirable direction 
						to the jury and his omission was prejudicial to the 
						appellant It is probable that the jury would have 
						returned a verdict of manslaughter if properly directed 
						on the issue of intent having regard to the 
						indiscernible so- called eye-witness account of PW4 
						about the fight between the deceased and the 
						appellant.In his written submissions, counsel for the 
						respondent seeks to convince this court that the 
						appellant hit the head of the deceased several times 
						against the canoe into which they fell. But that was not 
						the evidence at the trial. The only eyewitness called by 
						the prosecution, PW4 saw the head of the deceased being 
						hit against the canoe only once and then she left. She 
						was therefore not present to see what happened 
						thereafter. In the circumstances the conviction of the 
						appellant for Murder is quashed and in its stead is 
						substituted a conviction for manslaughter.The appellant 
						has been languishing in prison for the past 20 years on 
						death row and we are of the view that is a sufficient 
						and adequate sentence to have been imposed on a 
						conviction for Manslaughter. Accordingly, we hereby 
						order that having been imprisoned for 20 years on his 
						conviction for Murder the appellant be discharged 
						forthwith from prison. COUNSEL: MR. JOSEPH AMUI FOR
