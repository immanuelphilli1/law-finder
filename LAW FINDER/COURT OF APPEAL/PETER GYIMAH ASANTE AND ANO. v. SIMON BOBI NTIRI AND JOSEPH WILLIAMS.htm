						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">ANSAH, J.A.:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I also agree that this 
						appeal must be allowed. However I have decided to add a 
						few words to the Judgment just read. The facts 
						surrounding this case have already been narrated and I 
						shall therefore save myself the burden of repeating them 
						here and will only refer to a few of them when it 
						becomes necessary so to do.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I shall begin by 
						quoting from the judgment under appeal wherein the 
						learned trial judge said inter alia that: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;It is my finding that 
						since both interests are not registered, the first in 
						time should prevail. It was incumbent on the claimants 
						to make a search to satisfy themselves that the disputed 
						house was not encumbered. This they failed to do and 
						went ahead to purchase the house at their own peril. The 
						contract of sale entered into between the plaintiffs and 
						the defendants cannot be defeated by a sale made eight 
						months later.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The next issue to 
						consider is whether the claimants can come under the 
						umbrella of innocent purchasers without notice....&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was in evidence that 
						at a point in time the defendant could not be traced. He 
						was served by substituted service and processes were 
						posted at the building the subject matter of this 
						appeal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This I find was notice 
						to the claimants that there was some court action on the 
						judgment. The claimant could have taken action by 
						joining the suit or taken some other steps. They failed 
						to take any such steps and with the postings affixed on 
						the building, I find the claimants cannot claim to be 
						innocent purchasers without notice.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There can be no doubt 
						whatsoever that where the equities are equal, the first 
						in time shall prevail, an equitable maxim rendered with 
						some classical flourishes as:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Qui prior est tempore 
						potior est jure.&#8221; he who is earlier in time is stronger 
						in law. Whilst not denying the poignancy of this maxim 
						it must also be stated that there is nothing inflexible 
						or sacrosanct about it. Expose it to the test 
						encapsulated in the doctrine of the bona fide purchaser 
						of a legal estate without notice, and its brittle nature 
						becomes clear. See Usher vrs: Darko 1977 1 GLR.476. For 
						this latter doctrine to apply, the onus is on the 
						purchaser to prove that he gave value for the property 
						as a result of which he obtained the legal estate and 
						this he did without notice, actual, constructive or 
						inputed. It is apparent from the passage in the Judgment 
						referred to above that the trial judge reasoned that as 
						there were Court processes posted on the building then 
						the claimant should have known that it was encumbered. 
						That way so far there was no evidence that the claimant 
						had actual notice that there was any encumbrance on the 
						building: neither was any notice imputed to him. It is 
						this Constructive notice that he must be looked at now.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Now the Conveyancing 
						Decree, 1973, NRCD.175 provides in section 36(4) that &#8220;A 
						purchaser shall not be deemed to be or ever to have been 
						affected with notice of any matter or thing of which he 
						might have had notice if he had investigated the title 
						or made inquiries in regard to matters prior to the 
						period of commencement of title ascertained in 
						accordance with sub-section (1) (2) or (3), Unless he 
						actually makes such investigation or inquiries.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Section 36 as a whole 
						deals with statutory Commencement of title, which is 
						pegged under section 36(1) at Thirty years. A purchaser 
						is expected to investigate the title of his vendor for 
						that period of time. The common law is that a purchaser 
						will be held to have had notice of what appears on the 
						title for the period. Now the Decree has done away with 
						that rule. The rule will come to play only upon one 
						condition, namely, where the purchaser actually makes 
						the investigation or inquiries. In other words where the 
						purchaser did not make the search, investigations or 
						inquiries, he would not be fixed with notice of what he 
						would have discovered as to the title of the vendor. 
						Such a purchaser under section 36(1) cannot be said to 
						have had constructive knowledge of any prior title of 
						the property. It is clear that in this wise the Ghanaian 
						law is not in accord with the Common law.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial judge said 
						that it was incumbent on the claimants to have made a 
						search to satisfy themselves that the house was not 
						encumbered. I think the consequences of his failure to 
						make a search have been taken care of by section 36(4) 
						for the Decree. Simply put it does not mean the claimant 
						has constructive knowledge of what he would discover if 
						he had made the search. On the facts of this case, the 
						plaintiff did not register his title and it is wondered 
						what the claimant would have discovered if he had made 
						the search in the first place. I hold that the failure 
						of the claimant to make the search should not have 
						driven the judge into dismissing the claim, as she 
						seemed to have done. Still under the doctrine of the 
						bona fide purchaser without notice, it is important that 
						due consideration is given to the bona fides or good 
						faith of the purchaser. The dictionary of English Law by 
						Earl Jouitt defined good faith at p.890 as follows: &#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;A thing is deemed to 
						be done in good faith if it is done honestly whether or 
						not it is done negligently.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In Kwaku Badu vrs: Op. 
						Kwaku Appiah; unreported, Written Judgments, January 
						-December, 1967, (Civil) p.135. Crabbe, J.A. as he then 
						was, dealing with the issue of &#8220;good faith&#8221; in an action 
						for the recovery and possession of a piece of land, said 
						at p.140 that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;I would add that if 
						there was anything which could arouse the suspicion of 
						the (farmer) that there was something wrong with the 
						transaction leading to the acquisition of the land, he 
						would not be acting in good faith if he shut his eyes to 
						the facts, or purposely abstained from inquiring into 
						them.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The learned judge went 
						on to add that the purchasers must show that his belief 
						was honestly held and founded upon reasonable grounds. 
						It is beyond doubt that a person&#8217;s bona fides is 
						subjective but objectively determined. The meaning is 
						that to arrive at whether or not a person acted in good 
						faith one necessarily has to consider all the 
						circumstances and the facts surrounding the purchase as 
						a whole. Thus in Dr. Oklikah vrs Col. Amusu Civil Appeal 
						No. 9/66 dated 26 March, 1997, unreported, the Supreme 
						Court in its unanimous Judgment allowing the appeal of 
						the defendant/appellant in a land matter considered 
						inter alia the issue whether the plaintiff had prior 
						notice of the defendants equitable interest in the 
						disputed property and also the fraud perpetrated by the 
						vendor. The court held unanimously that the plaintiff 
						knew that the appellant was the first to have bought the 
						property. He armed with that knowledge, nevertheless 
						went on and purchased the property and rushed to have 
						his document registered before the appellant did. The 
						Supreme Court did not give its blessing to this 
						practice. In this appeal, the trial judge did address 
						herself to the issue as to whether or not the claimant 
						was an innocent purchaser without notice. She resolved 
						that issues this way. I have already referred to parts 
						up of her judgment on this issue.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;It is in evidence that 
						at a point in time, the defendant could not be traced. 
						He was served by substituted service and processes were 
						posted at the building the subject matter of this suit. 
						This I find was notice to the claimants that there was 
						some court action on the property. The claimants could 
						have taken action by joining the suit or taken some 
						other steps. They failed to take any such step and with 
						the postings affixed on the building. I find that the 
						claimants cannot claim to be innocent purchasers without 
						notice.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There are several 
						reasons why the trial judge erred in concluding as she 
						did that the claimant could not be held in law to have 
						purchased the property without notice. In the first 
						place she did not bother herself with finding what these 
						processes which were served by substituted service were. 
						It was not enough for her to have just said that 
						processes were served; She should have found out and 
						stated what they were and whether or not they were 
						enough to tell the world that the property was a subject 
						matter of a dispute so as to put the claimant to the 
						inquiry.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Secondly it did not 
						appear that there was any evidence to support a finding 
						that at all times material, the &#8220;process&#8221; were affixed 
						on the property. Thirdly, and that is the most important 
						reason, counsel for the plaintiff made it abundantly 
						clear from his written submissions that the writ of 
						summons in the matter between the plaintiff and the 
						defendant was issued or filed on 7th February, 1996.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The claimant on the 
						other hand fully paid the ¢23 million for the house on 
						6th September, 1995 as per Exhibit BB1. The inference 
						from the chronology of events was that the claimant 
						bought the house before the plaintiff instituted his 
						action against the defendant. In these circumstances 
						even if any &#8220;processes&#8221; were posted on the building, it 
						was done some months after the claimant had purchased 
						that house. It would be unreasonable to hold that the 
						claimant or for that matter anybody should have been 
						aware of the fact that someone else had bought the house 
						earlier. When one talks of notice, one meant actual 
						knowledge or cognisance before or at the time of the 
						transaction in question, or what he would have known if 
						he had made proper searches and investigated the title 
						of his vendors before he purchased the property. Even if 
						it could be said that the posting of court processes on 
						a house was enough to put an intending purchaser on the 
						alert, the fact that same were posted after the purchase 
						had on the evidence already been completed, made it 
						unreasonable for the conclusion to be drawn that the 
						purchaser had notice. I think if the trial judge had 
						been a little more circumspect on these facts she would 
						not have come to the conclusion she did so far as the 
						issue of notice was concerned. She erred on this issue.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plain fact in this 
						action was that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant 
						registered their title to the property: Registration in 
						effect is actual notice of the instrument to the whole 
						world, under section 25(1) of the Land Registry Act, 
						1962, (Act.122), As there was no registration, none 
						could be held to have had any actual notice of any 
						purchase. What was more, the plaintiff was never in 
						possession and it was not open to say that his (i.e. 
						plaintiff) presence in the house was enough to send the 
						claimant on the inquiry as to the defendant&#8217;s title.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the facts before the 
						court the defendant gave a written consent to transfer 
						the house to the claimant and informed the Managing 
						Director of the State Housing Corporation accordingly: 
						See Exhibit BB.3. On the authority of Ayekpa vrs: Sackey 
						Mensah 1984-86 1 GLR.173 that act conferred the legal 
						title on the claimant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Looking at the 
						circumstances of the case as a whole one could not help 
						concluding that the plaintiff did not exhibit that 
						vigilance which would be expected of someone who wished 
						to be aided by equity. He appeared to have relapsed into 
						a deep hibernation soon after paying part of the 
						purchase price to the defendant. It was unfathomable how 
						the claimant could have effected these massive work in 
						reconstructing and developing the house in the manner he 
						described without the plaintiff seeing it or challenging 
						him. This is the kind of indolence equity will frown 
						upon and refuse to lend a helping hand. I think an 
						objective appraisal of the facts shows that the claimant 
						was an innocent purchaser without notice of the 
						plaintiff&#8217;s equitable interest in the house. As the 
						trial judge dwelt predominantly on the issue of notice 
						to dismiss the claimant&#8217;s title to the house, she erred

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I cannot end my 
						judgment without condemning the conduct of the 
						defendant. He is just like the appellant in Zeini vrs: 
						Schandorf 1976 2 GLR. 418; he was a vogue. He after 
						collecting some millions of Cedis from the plaintiff for 
						the purpose of selling a house to him collected more 
						money from the claimant for selling the same house to 
						him. This sort of sordid practice is frequent in this 
						part of the country and many unsuspecting purchasers 
						have fallen victims to these diabolical machinations of 
						people like the defendants in this case. It was time 
						they put an end to this infamous practice. I register my 
						abhorrence to this sort of shady practice and make 
						myself clear that if the evidence had shown that the 
						claimant was aware in any way of the plaintiff&#8217;s dealing 
						with the defendant on the house or that he in any way 
						fainted himself or was a participant in the fraud or the 
						plaintiff, I would have opined that the plaintiff should 
						be protected. It was not so hence my decision to cast my 
						vote in favour of the appeal succeeding. In short I 
						agree that the appeal be allowed, even as I concur in 
						the orders made.</span></p>

						<span style="font-family: Arial">The judgment is in

						was delivered on the 27th day of March 1998 at the Accra 
						High Court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The facts culminating 
						to the ruling of the High Court are that the 
						Defendant/Judgment/ Debtor was an employee of the 
						National Procurement Agency. The National Procurement 
						Agency granted Simon Bobi-Ntiri, the 
						Defendant/Judgment/Debtor a loan to enable him to secure 
						House No.18 Macroni Street Adenta Accra, from State 
						Housing Corporation.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The National 
						Procurement Agency upon the termination of the 
						appointment of the Defendant/Judgment/Debtor demanded 
						the repayment of the balance of the loan, which was at 
						that time ¢9,937,741.20. That the National Procurement 
						Agency would take over the house if the balance was not 
						paid by the Defendant/Judgment/Debtor to the National 
						Procurement Agency.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The 
						Defendant/Judgment/Debtor then in January, 1995 agreed 
						with the Plaintiff/ Judgment/Creditor to sell the said 
						house to the Plaintiff/Judgment/Creditor for the sum of 
						¢16,500,000.00.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was agreed that the 
						payment was to be made in installments, the 1st 
						installment of ¢11,000,000.00 was to be made as quickly 
						as possible to enable the Defendant/Judgment/ Debtor 
						repay the loan he took from the National Procurement 
						Agency.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the 25th January, 
						the Plaintiff/Judgment/Creditor/Respondent and the 
						Defendant/ Judgment/Debtor entered into an agreement for 
						the sale of the said house to the Plaintiff/ 
						Judgment/Creditor/Respondent. Eight months after the 
						execution of the contract between the 
						Plaintiff/Judgment/Creditor and the 
						Debtor/Judgment/Debtor/Respondent, the 
						Defendant/Judgment/Debtor/Respondent sold the same 
						house/property to the Claimant/ Appellant for an amount 
						of ¢23,000.000.00 and the Claimant/Appellant paid the 
						Defendant/Judgment/Debtor/Respondent an amount of US 
						$20,000 being the equivalent of the purchase price. The 
						Claimant/Appellant was put in immediate possession and 
						he developed the house from two bedrooms to four-bedroom 
						house and also made a wall around the house costing him 
						35,000 US dollars.</span></p>

						<span style="font-family: Arial">The

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After taking evidence 
						the Learned High Court Judge gave judgment in favour of

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On 20th October, 1997,

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">From the record, the

						Plaintiff/Judgment/Creditor/Respondent in January 1995 
						for ¢16.500.000.00 and eight months after he again sold 
						the same house to the Claimant/ Appellant for 
						¢23,000,000.00. The Defendant/Judgment/Debtor prepared 
						documents for the two purchasers of the house but none 
						of these documents was registered.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At the time the 
						Claimant/Appellant bought the house he did not know that 
						the house had been sold to the

						Claimant/Appellant had made a Search he would not have 
						found out that the house had already been sold because 
						the document given to the 
						Plaintiff/Judgment/Creditor/Respondent was not 
						registered.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Learned trial judge 
						based her judgment on the principle of first in time 
						should prevail and dismissed the Claimant/Appellants. 
						Learned trial judge stated in her ruling as follows: &#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The assignment between 
						the defendant herein and the Plaintiffs is dated 27th 
						day of January, 1995. Paragraph 4 of the said agreement 
						states:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Vendor hereby

						dated 6th September, 1995. The said receipt was issued 
						to the Claimants by the defendant herein.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the strength of this 
						the learned trial Judge stated that since both interests 
						are not registered, the first in time should prevail and 
						she subsequently dismissed the inter-pleader of the 
						Claimant/Appellant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Claimant/Appellant 
						after buying the house was put into possession and we 
						developed it from a two-bedroom house to a four-bedroom

						mother was ejected.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the 6th of

						State Housing Corporation for him, 
						Defendant/Judgment/Debtor, to assign his interest in the 
						house to Mr. Joseph Williams, the Claimant/Appellant. 
						The Defendant/Judgment/Debtor attached a copy of the 
						Deed of Assignment for the pursual of the State Housing 
						Corporation.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">From what I have stated 
						above that the document given to the Plaintiff/Judgment/ 
						Creditor/Respondent was not registered therefore the 
						Claimant/Appellant could not have found out that the 
						house had already been sold to the 
						Plaintiff/Judgment/Creditor/ Respondent even if the 
						Claimant/Appellant had made a search. The 
						Claimant/Appellant was an innocent purchaser.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Learned Trial Judge 
						rested her decision on the equitable maxim qui prior est 
						tempore potior est jure, which means &#8220;He who is first in 
						time is the stronger in law.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This rule according to 
						decided case is not however inflexible. See Ayekpa vrs: 
						Sackey Mensah (1984-86) 1 GLR. page 172 at page 177.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instant case the 
						Plaintiff/Judgment/Creditor/Respondent was not put in 
						possession of the house when he purchased it from the 
						Defendant/Judgment/Debtor in January 1995.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Howbeit, the 
						Claimant/Appellant was put in possession of the house in 
						September, 1995 and he developed the house from two 
						bedrooms to four-bedroom house. The Plaintiff/ 
						Judgment/Creditor/Respondent did not do anything to 
						prevent the Claimant/Appellant from developing the house 
						for two years before he (Plaintiff/Judgment/Creditor/ 
						Respondent) took the action against the 
						Defendant/Judgment/Debtor. Equity aids the vigilant and 
						not the indolent. In my candid opinion the Plaintiff/ 
						Judgment/ Creditor/ Respondent was guilty of omission to 
						stop the Claimant/ Appellant from developing the house. 
						Therefore his prior equitable in the said house cannot 
						be accepted against the Claimant/Appellant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At this stage I will 
						refer to Halsbury's Laws of England and Equities Rank in 
						Order of Time.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;See. 10. The Legal 
						Estate Gives Priority. When there is an existing 
						equitable interest in property, and an interest is 
						subsequently created in favour of a purchaser for value 
						without notice of the earlier interest; and that 
						purchaser either gets in the legal estate at the time of 
						his purchase, or, in certain circumstances, after his 
						purchase, his possession of the legal estate gives him 
						priority over the earlier equitable owner.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The equities being 
						equal except as regards time, the legal estate, property 
						got in by the owner of the later equitable interest, 
						entitles him to hold the property either as absolute 
						owner or until his mortgage is discharged, as the case 
						may be. There is, in the absence of notice or of any 
						other circumstance to postpone him, other than that of 
						being later in point of time, no equity attaching upon 
						his conscience by virtue of which the court will deprive 
						him of his legal advantage; and the subsequent purchaser 
						is entitled to the like priority if he has the better 
						right to call for a conveyance of the legal estate. The 
						importance which courts of equity, in deciding 
						priorities attach to the legal estate, is an instance of 
						the general principle that equity follows the law&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Since the 
						claimant/Appellant bought the house in dispute for value 
						without notice that that house had been sold to the 
						Plaintiff/Judgment/Creditor/Respondent the Claimant/ 
						Appellant got the legal estate of the house at the time 
						of the purchase his legal purchase gives him priority 
						over the earlier purchaser i.e. the

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">By reason of this legal
