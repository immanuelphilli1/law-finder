												The plaintiff/respondent 
												(hereinafter simply referred to 
												as the respondent) is a body 
												corporate based in the state of 
												Nebraska in the United States of 
												America. The defendant/appellant 
												(hereinafter simply referred to 
												as the appellant) is also a body 
												corporate but based in Ghana 
												with its registered offices in 
												Tema. Between January and 
												February 2000, so states the 
												respondent in his statement of 
												claim, the respondent at the 
												request of the appellant sold 
												and delivered to the latter a 
												quantity of poultry product to 
												the total value of US$123250.91. 
												It was agreed between the 
												parties that payment for the 
												goods would be made sixty days 
												after the arrival and delivery 
												to the appellant. A dispute 
												eventually arose between the 
												parties over the issue of 
												payment for the goods. The 
												respondent claims that the 
												appellant after receiving the 
												goods in April 2000, made only a 
												part payment of US$38,905.02 
												leaving a balance of 
												US$84,345.89, which he failed to 
												pay.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellant refutes the claim, 
												averring that the respondent had 
												shipped nine (9) containers of 
												turkey tails F.O.B. Tema, Ghana, 
												instead of four (4) containers 
												of turkey tails and &#8216;if 
												possible&#8217; four (4) containers 
												fowl leg quarters&#8217; contracted to 
												be delivered C.I.F. Tema. This 
												mode of shipments, ie F.O.B. 
												instead of C.I.F. gave rise to a 
												heavy cost burden on the 
												appellant for which he was 
												obliged to find additional 
												resources to offset. It is also 
												the claim of the appellant that 
												when the respondent was informed 
												of the additional burden 
												occasioned by the F.O.B. 
												delivery, the respondent 
												intimated that he would pay for 
												the freight and incidental 
												charges, only to honour just a 
												portion of this undertaking. The 
												appellant stated that the 
												partial contribution for the 
												freight paid by the respondent 
												was US$14,000 made to Maersk 
												Shipping Co. Ltd. Against the 
												background of these claims and 
												counterclaims the respondent 
												filed his writ of summons at the 
												Fast Track High Court, Accra 
												claiming the following reliefs:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(i) Recovery of the sum of 
												eighty four thousand, three 
												hundred and forty five point 
												eight nine United State dollars 
												(US$84,345.89) or its cedi 
												equivalent at the prevailing 
												forex bureau rate at the time of 
												payment being the outstanding 
												balance of the purchase price of 
												poultry products sold and 
												delivered to the defendant by 
												the plaintiff at the request of 
												the defendant, which said amount 
												defendant has either neglected 
												and/or refused pay to the 
												plaintiff in spite of repeated 
												demands made payment.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(ii) Interest on the said amount 
												at the prevailing commercial 
												bank rate from the 1st day of 
												May 2000 until date of final 
												judgment.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Attached to the writ was a 
												statement of claim clearly 
												setting out the facts upon which 
												the respondent rested his 
												claims. The appellant entered 
												appearance to the writ on 18th 
												October 2001 and on 31st October 
												2001 the respondent filed 
												summons for summary judgment to 
												be entered against the 
												appellant. On 8th November 2001, 
												the appellant filed his 
												statement of defence and 
												counterclaim as well as an 
												affidavit in opposition to the 
												respondent&#8217;s application for 
												summary judgment. The motion for 
												summary judgment was duly argued 
												whereupon the trial High Court 
												judge on 12th December 2001, 
												granted the application and 
												accordingly entered the judgment 
												prayed by the respondent. This 
												appeal is against the decision 
												thus entered in favour of the 
												respondent and is premised upon 
												the following grounds:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) The judgment was against the 
												weight of evidence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) The learned trial judge 
												erred in law;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) by entering final judgement 
												against defendant/appellant in 
												the face of triable issues 
												contained in the affidavit 
												evidence and pleadings of the 
												defendant/appellant disclosing 
												the circumstances which required 
												investigation e.g.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(i) As to the essential 
												ingredients of the contract (the 
												subject matter of the dispute 
												and </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(ii) as to the amount to be 
												paid.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) Because there was a good 
												defence on the merits of the 
												case which showed a plausible 
												dispute as to the nature of the 
												contract entered into and the 
												mode of its performance, the 
												amount due to the plaintiff 
												including the banning and sale 
												(which was held to be injurious 
												to the health of Ghanaians)'</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is obvious from the grounds 
												listed supra that the thrust of 
												the appellant&#8217;s complaint is 
												that the judgment entered 
												against him is against the 
												weight of evidence with the 
												remaining grounds being the 
												apparent misdirections upon 
												which the appellant premises his 
												complaint. In other words the 
												appellant is contending that the 
												affidavit evidence both in 
												support and against the motion 
												raised tribal issues that 
												warranted a refusal of the 
												motion and in favour of a full 
												trial on the issues. Given this 
												scenario I would consider the 
												grounds (1) and (2) together. In 
												doing so it is necessary to have 
												recourse to the High Court rules 
												under which the motion was 
												considered and granted together 
												with the evidence albeit 
												affidavit evidence and other 
												attachments placed before the 
												court to ascertain the 
												justification or otherwise of 
												the grant. Order 14 of LN140A as 
												amended by LI 1129 is the 
												relevant rule and it provides as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;1. Where in an action begun by 
												a writ a defendant has been 
												served with a statement of claim 
												and has entered an appearance, 
												the plaintiff may apply to the 
												court for judgment against him 
												on the ground that he has no 
												defence to a claim included in 
												the writ or to a particular part 
												of such a claim or that he has 
												no defence to such a claim or 
												part except as to the amount of 
												any damages claimed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3 (1) defendant may show cause 
												against the application by 
												affidavit or otherwise to the 
												satisfaction of the court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) Where the defendant shows 
												cause, the court may order him 
												(or, in the case of a body 
												corporate, any director, 
												manager, secretary or similar 
												officer thereof, or any person 
												purporting to act in any such 
												capacity to attend and be 
												examined on oath if it appears 
												to the court that special 
												circumstances make this 
												desirable, or to produce any 
												document,......</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												5 (1) hearing the application 
												the court may&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) Give such judgment for the 
												plaintiff against the defendant 
												on the relevant claim or part of 
												a claim as may be just having 
												regard to the nature of the 
												remedy or relief sought unless 
												the defendant satisfies the 
												court, with respect to that 
												claim or part, that there is an 
												issue or question in dispute 
												which ought to be tried or that 
												there ought for some other 
												reason to be a trial of that 
												claim or part; or &#8220;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The summary proceedings provided 
												under Order 14 of LN.140A as 
												amended by LI 1129 are designed 
												to fast tract the trial process 
												by enabling a party to obtain 
												quick judgment where there is 
												plainly no defence to the claim. 
												This is achieved by dispensing 
												with a full trial where there is 
												no arguable or triable issue. 
												The Supreme Court Practice 1997 
												Vol. 1 Page 147 throws a very 
												refreshing searchlight on the 
												said Order 14 making it clear 
												that the rule does not confer a 
												right upon a plaintiff to 
												proceed under Order 14 in every 
												case in which this procedure may 
												be appropriate but only 'on 
												ground that the defendant has no 
												defence' to a particular claim. 
												The summary process should 
												therefore be used only in proper 
												cases and should not be employed 
												for tactical purposes (see per 
												Scott L.J. in Dott vs. Brown 
												(1936) 1 A.E.R.545). An 
												essential requirement for the 
												grant of summary judgment is a 
												statement of the belief that the 
												defendant has no defence to the 
												claim. In this vein it will be 
												an understatement to suggest 
												that the respondent had in his 
												affidavit verifying the motion 
												and in particular paragraph 14 
												thereof, accordingly stated his 
												belief that the appellant has no 
												defence to his claim. This is 
												how the respondent put it:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;14. It is my belief that 
												defendant has no defence 
												whatsoever in law to plaintiff's 
												claim for the said outstanding 
												balance in the sum of eightyfour 
												thousand, three hundred and 
												forty five point eight nine 
												United States dollars 
												(US$84,345.89) plus accumulated 
												interest thereon.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Let me state at this juncture 
												that the fact that a defendant 
												has served a defence will not, 
												in a proper case, necessarily 
												prevent the plaintiff from 
												making the requisite affidavit 
												swearing to the belief that 
												there is no defence and 
												proceeding under Order 14. (Mc 
												Lardy vs. Slateum (1890) 24 
												Q.B.D.504). If any defence, 
												however demonstrably false it 
												may be, has been served, &quot;it is 
												essential that the affidavit in 
												support adverts to this and then 
												goes on to depose that 
												notwithstanding such defence the 
												deponent believes that there is 
												no defence and explains why this 
												is so. Not to do so is 
												inconsistent with the duty of 
												candour to the court in 
												interlocutory matters.&quot; &#8212;(See 
												The Supreme Court Practice 1997, 
												page 150). This much also was 
												answered in the supplementary 
												affidavit in support of 
												plaintiff&#8217;s application filed on 
												15/11/2001 wherein it was 
												deposed that:</span></p>

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;7. The defendant&#8217;s deposition 
												that plaintiff owe him could not 
												have been deposed to in good 
												faith and are entirely false as 
												per annexure &#8216;DAH1&#8217; and &#8216;DAH2&#8217;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												8. It is my belief that the 
												defendant&#8217;s statement of defence 
												and counterclaim and in the 
												affidavit in opposition are a 
												complete sham and do not 
												disclose any defence in law to 
												plaintiff&#8217;s claim.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Meanwhile, the appellant in his 
												statement of defence and 
												counterclaim filed on 8/11/2001 
												raised the area of enquiry to be 
												the following:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;(i) the essential ingredients 
												of the contract, the subject 
												matter in dispute.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(ii) The mode of 
												shipment/delivery of the 
												products was other than that 
												agreed i.e. C.I.F. instead of 
												the F.O.B. resorted to and 
												leading to unwarranted hiked 
												costs.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(iii) That the parties agreed to 
												six containers to be shipped 
												rather than the nine (9) 
												delivered.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(iv) The amount to be paid.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(v) Whether the plaintiff has an 
												agent/principal relationship to 
												warrant the carrying out of 
												instructions given by the 
												principal.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The combined effect of rules 3 
												(1) and 5 (1) of Order 14 as 
												amended (supra), the defendant 
												to show cause, to the 
												satisfaction of the court, that 
												the application for summary 
												judgment ought not be granted 
												because there are triable issues 
												to be determined by the court. 
												This is so notwithstanding the 
												applicant's advertence to the 
												defence and his (applicant&#8217;s) 
												steadfast belief that there is 
												no defence to the summons. The 
												appellant must therefore 
												demonstrate and satisfy the 
												court as to the triable issues 
												to be resolved. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the instant appeal it is one 
												of the appellant's contentions 
												that the mode of shipment or 
												delivery of the products was 
												other than that agreed i.e. 
												C.I.F instead of the F.O.B 
												resorted to and which led to 
												unwarranted hiked costs. If the 
												costs were indeed hiked due to 
												non-adherence to the terms of 
												the contract, it certainly is an 
												issue for the court to determine 
												and apportion responsibility. It 
												is apparent that the mode of 
												shipment of the goods, be it 
												C.I.F. or F.O.B., imports 
												different fiscal implications to 
												the parties. The appellant 
												referred to Exb. KO2 in support 
												of his contention. In Exb. KO2, 
												Mr. Kwaku Owusu, Managing 
												Director of appellant company 
												stated amongst others, the 
												following:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;With reference to the 
												conversation we had last night 
												on the phone concerning the 
												$75,000 loan from Exim Bank, I 
												would like you to purchase 4 
												containers of the turkey tails 
												(if possible) &quot;Delivered CIF, 
												Tema.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I have realised that if we buy 
												it at FOB, Tema, although we 
												would have more containers, I 
												would face some difficulties 
												paying the freight in Ghana. 
												This is because when Maersk is 
												collecting the freight from me, 
												the dollar would be calculated 
												at the current black market rate 
												but not bank rate. This makes it 
												too expensive because if I wire 
												money to you in dollars, the 
												bank rate for the dollar will be 
												more reasonable. &quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is significant to also know 
												that Exb. KO2&#8217;s opening 
												paragraph referred to the 
												parties' conversation on the 
												phone concerning the $75,000 
												loan from the Exim Bank. The 
												requirement for the delivery of 
												the turkey tails C.I.F. Tema 
												appears to be so significant to 
												the appellants as to warrant its 
												confirmation in writing (supra). 
												There is an apparent ambiguity 
												in the opening paragraph of Exb. 
												KO2 introduced by the expression 
												'if possible', immediately after 
												the words 'turkey tails'. 
												However upon a closer scrutiny 
												of the document as a whole, it 
												becomes obvious that the 
												so-called ambiguity is only a 
												mirage. An impression one gets 
												upon reading Exbs. KO1, KO2 and 
												paragraph 9 of the affidavit in 
												opposition of 8/11/2001 is that 
												the respondent having succeeded 
												in obtaining the credit facility 
												of US$75,000 for the appellant, 
												the latter was now in a position 
												to place his orders which should 
												then be the basis of their 
												contract, if honoured and 
												subject to 15% charges to the 
												respondent. The respondent 
												however holds a contrary 
												position to that advanced supra 
												and therefore the parties are 
												joined on the issue, which must 
												be unravelled by resort to a 
												full trial. The very position of 
												the plaintiff who arranged the 
												loan facility and is to earn 15% 
												financial charges is subject to 
												divergent categorization by the 
												two parties. Is he an agent of 
												the appellant as contended by 
												appellant or what? Whilst I am 
												inclined to the view that there 
												are triable issues pertaining to 
												the very terms of the contract 
												between the parties, I must 
												hasten to 'indicate that the 
												claim by the appellant that the 
												contract was frustrated &quot;by the 
												banning of the importation and 
												sale of same by the Government 
												of Ghana through the Ministry of 
												Health&quot; could not have been one 
												of the reasons for this 
												conclusion.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I am also mindful of the 
												appellant's admission that if 
												possible they owe only fifty 
												seven thousand dollars 
												($57,000). Aside of this, the 
												defendant raised a counterclaim 
												seeking damages for breach of 
												contract, recovery of all 
												expenses incurred as a result of 
												the breach as well as interest. 
												It is obvious from the 
												counterclaim that is arises from 
												and is so connected with the 
												subject matter of the original 
												claim, which latter it appears 
												to contradict.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is therefore not correct that 
												the appellant&#8217;s defence and 
												counterclaim is a complete sham 
												and discloses no defence to the 
												plaintiff&#8217;s claim as contended 
												by the respondent. It is only 
												fair and proper in such an 
												instance that account ought to 
												be taken of the defendant&#8217;s 
												counterclaim. Diplock L.J. 
												succinctly states this position 
												in Adam and Harvey Ltd. Vs. Int. 
												Maritime Supplies Co. Ltd. 
												(1966) 1 Lloyd&#8217;s Rep. @ 572 
												thus:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;I think having listened to the 
												argument before us, the learned 
												Judge must have been persuaded 
												that the counterclaim did not 
												relate to the subject matter of 
												the agreement in which case his 
												order might well have been 
												justified. I think, however, 
												that if one looks at the 
												evidence it is sufficiently 
												plain that the whole of the 
												counterclaim does relate to the 
												same subject matter as the 
												agreement and since one cannot 
												say that the counterclaim is 
												bogus or a sham whatever its 
												ultimate merits may turn out to 
												be, I think the 
												defendant-appellant&#8217;s here were 
												entitled to unconditional leave 
												to defend.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the light of the appellant&#8217;s 
												admission of partial liability, 
												I am of the view that judgment 
												ought to have been entered only 
												for the sum of US$57,000 as per 
												Exhibit K 014 and paragraph 21 
												of the statement of defence 
												leaving the difference to be 
												contested in a full trial to 
												determine the outstanding claims 
												of the parties. In the result, I 
												set aside the judgment entered 
												by the High Court on the 12th 
												December 2001 against the 
												appellant and substitute 
												judgment for US$57,000 for the 
												respondent. Subject to the 
												foregoing I order a full trial 
												to resolve the remaining issues. 
												Appeal allowed to this extent. I 
												am of the opinion that this is a 
												proper case to order that each 
												party should bear his own costs.</span></p>
