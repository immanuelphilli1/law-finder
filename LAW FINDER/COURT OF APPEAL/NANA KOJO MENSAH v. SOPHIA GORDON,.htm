												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Before the District Court Grade 
												I, Sekondi, Nana Kojo Mensah 
												(hereinafter referred to as the 
												plaintiff) sued Sophia Gordon 
												(hereinafter called the 
												defendant) and claimed the 
												reliefs endorsed on the Writ of 
												Summons. The Plaintiff's 
												Solicitors filed a Statement of 
												Claim which among other matters 
												averred that the plaintiff had 
												sued in a representative 
												capacity. Solicitors acting for 
												the defendant filed a Statement 
												of Defence and a counter-claim. 
												No reply to the Statement of 
												Defence was filed by Plaintiff's 
												Solicitor. No Statement of 
												Defence to the Counter-claim was 
												filed by the Plaintiff. 
												Pleadings were completed and 
												hearing on the merits commenced. 
												The Plaintiff closed his case. 
												During the hearing of the case 
												for the Defendant, the 
												Solicitors acting for the 
												Defendant filed a Motion on 
												Notice praying the trial Court 
												to make an order to join one 
												Bosom Kwesi as Co-defendant.&nbsp; 
												The Co-Defendant did not file 
												any pleadings after he was 
												joined as Co-Defendant. The 
												Co-Defendant closed his case 
												without calling any witnesses.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial magistrate in a 
												written judgment dismissed the 
												claim of the Plaintiff. He 
												dismissed the Counter-Claim of 
												the Defendant. He entered 
												Judgment for Co-Defendant on his 
												&#8220;counter-claim.&#8221; He awarded 
												co-defendant damages for 
												trespass committed by the 
												Plaintiff. The Defendant 
												accepted the dismissal of her 
												counter-claim and therefore she 
												did not appeal against the 
												judgment. She is therefore bound 
												by the judgment because she did 
												not appeal to the High Court 
												Sekondi.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the Notice of Appeal among 
												other grounds, two grounds were 
												stated as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;(a) The Learned Trial 
												Magistrate erred in holding that 
												the Plaintiff had no capacity to 
												institute the action.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) The Learned Trial Magistrate 
												erred in giving judgment for the 
												Co-Defendant when Co-Defendant 
												had not counter- claimed for any 
												relief at all.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellate High Court Judge 
												heard submissions and arguments 
												of Counsel for the parties. He 
												delivered his judgment.&nbsp; He 
												dismissed the appeal of the 
												Plaintiff. Dissatisfied and 
												aggrieved by the judgment of the 
												High Court, the Plaintiff 
												appealed further to this Court. 
												In the Notice of Appeal filed 
												against the judgment of the High 
												Court, two grounds of appeal 
												were filed. In the Notice of 
												Appeal one ground was that the 
												judgment was against the weight 
												of evidence before the District 
												Magistrate Court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the Statement of case filed 
												on behalf of the Plaintiff, his 
												Counsel argued ground (b) on the 
												notice of Appeal. He submitted 
												that the Co-Defendant did not 
												expressly ask for any particular 
												relief before the District 
												Court. He stated that after the 
												Co-Defendant was joined as a 
												Co-Defendant he failed and or 
												omitted to file any pleadings 
												before the District Court. He 
												submitted that Co-Defendant 
												breached the mandatory rules in 
												Cap.4. He argued that since 
												Co-Defendant did not file a 
												Statement of Defence and a 
												Counter-claim for a declaration 
												of title to the lands in dispute 
												the trial Magistrate was wrong 
												in law when he made a 
												declaration of title to the 
												lands in dispute in the person 
												of Co-Defendant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In reply, Counsel for 
												Co-Defendant submitted that the 
												trial Magistrate was right in 
												granting Co-Defendant judgment 
												on the evidence before him. He 
												pointed out that the 
												Co-Defendant was not ordered by 
												the Court to file any pleadings, 
												I must point out that these 
												arguments were made before the 
												appellate High Court Judge. In 
												his Judgment, he did not advert 
												to the serious issue of law 
												raised by Counsel for Plaintiff. 
												He did not advert to the reply 
												made by Counsel for 
												Co-Defendant. He therefore 
												failed to resolve the serious 
												issue of law raised for his 
												determination. The omission is 
												unfortunate and no doubt led to 
												this further appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In order to appreciate and 
												understand the criticism 
												levelled against the judgment of 
												the trial Magistrate, I must 
												consider the import of the 
												decision of the trial Magistrate 
												that &#8220;Co-Defendant has proved 
												his counter-claim.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As pointed out by Counsel for 
												Plaintiff, the claim of the 
												plaintiff was &#8220;for a declaration 
												of title to:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Ebionkessim land and</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Abakan land.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												These two parcels of land were 
												the subject-matter in dispute 
												between plaintiff and the 
												defendant. I refer to the 
												affidavit of co-defendant in 
												support of his motion to join as 
												co-defendant. In the affidavit, 
												Bosom Kwesi, described in 
												paragraph 3 the parcel of land 
												which he claimed. That paragraph 
												reads:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;3 .... I am applying to be 
												joined as co-defendant to 
												vindicate my family's title to 
												all that piece or parcel of 
												land...at Essipon and sharing 
												boundaries with Ngyiresi Stool, 
												Sofokrom Stool, the sea and 
												motor road.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The land claimed in this 
												affidavit must be described in a 
												Statement of Defence and 
												counter-claim so that it formed 
												part of the pleadings before the 
												court. The Rules of Court 
												(Cap.4) enjoined co-defendant to 
												file a Statement of Defence and 
												a Counter-claim to enable the 
												plaintiff and the defendant meet 
												the case he had put forward. The 
												failure of the co-defendant to 
												file pleadings cannot be glossed 
												over. It is fatal to the case of 
												co-defendant. A careful and 
												critical examination of the 
												boundaries of the two parcels of 
												land claimed by the plaintiff on 
												the one hand, and the 
												co-defendant on the other hand 
												shows that the two parcels of 
												land are not the same. In the 
												plaintiff&#8217;s description of the 
												land the boundaries do not 
												include a motor road. The sea is 
												also not given as a boundary. 
												The co-defendant claimed 
												boundaries with Nkuase land and 
												Mpimtsim Stool land in his 
												affidavit in support of his 
												application to join. It 
												mentioned a specific motor road 
												as Essipon to Inchaban motor 
												road. The different descriptions 
												of the lands claimed by the 
												plaintiff and co-defendant ought 
												not be treated casually by the 
												trial magistrate especially, in 
												this case, when co-defendant had 
												breached the rules of court and 
												not filed pleadings. The equally 
												serious slip by the trial 
												magistrate was his failure to 
												note that in his 
												evidence-in-chief the 
												co-defendant did not seek a 
												declaration of title to any 
												parcel of land. This is his 
												evidence-in-chief.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The Ebirashaen Abiradze Family 
												of Essipon owns a land at 
												Essipon. Our land shares 
												boundaries with Inchaban, 
												Sofokrom, Mpimtsim and Ngyiresi. 
												I have counter-claimed against 
												the plaintiff because Plaintiff 
												who does not belong to the 
												family has granted part of the 
												family land to one Keanye and 
												the nephew of a certain lawyer.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The description of the land as 
												&quot;our land&quot; does not meet the 
												burden of proof of ownership of 
												the land in respect of which he 
												obtained a declaration of title. 
												He failed to prove the 
												boundaries of the land he 
												claimed. He failed to adduce 
												other evidence to corroborate 
												the claim he had put forward. In 
												the instant case, the plaintiff 
												claimed membership of the very 
												family to which co-defendant 
												belonged. The plaintiff sued in 
												a representative capacity. The 
												co-defendant in his evidence 
												before the trial court described 
												himself as head of the very 
												family to which the plaintiff 
												claimed membership. The 
												co-defendant did not purport to 
												defend the action in a 
												representative capacity; he did 
												not plead his capacity. The 
												judgment in favour of 
												co-defendant was therefore not 
												free from doubt. Was the land 
												claimed by co-defendant adjudged 
												to be land belonging to the 
												Ebirashaen Ebiradze family of 
												Essipon? To expose the grave 
												error of the trial magistrate, I 
												refer to paragraph 1 of 
												plaintiff&#8217;s statement of claim 
												thus:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The Plaintiff sued for himself 
												and on behalf of the Ebirashaen 
												Ebiradze Stool Family of 
												Essipon.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial magistrate made a 
												declaration of title to the land 
												in dispute &#8220;in the Ebirashaen 
												Ebiradze Stool Family of 
												Essipon&#8221; I must point out that 
												in the instant action that was 
												the declaration sought by the 
												plaintiff. Indeed the trial 
												magistrate concluded his 
												judgment thus:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;There is therefore evidence on 
												record to support a finding that 
												the allodial title to all the 
												parcels of land situate at 
												Essipon is vested in the 
												Ebirashaen Ebiradze family of 
												Essipon.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I must point out immediately 
												that the co-defendant did not 
												file a counter-claim in this 
												action for a declaration of 
												title to any particular parcel 
												of land. Since the trial 
												magistrate held that on the 
												evidence before him the lands 
												described by plaintiff in the 
												writ of summons were lands 
												belonging to Ebirashaen Ebiradze 
												Stool Family, he gravely erred 
												in law when he dismissed the 
												claim of the plaintiff. The 
												plaintiff was entitled to 
												judgment on his claim.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												At this point, I must draw 
												attention to what I view as 
												grave breach of professional 
												ethics on the part of Dr. 
												Tackie-Otoo. It was Dr. 
												Tackie-Otoo who acted as 
												Solicitor and Counsel for 
												defendant. He also acted as 
												Solicitor and Counsel for 
												Defendant throughout the whole 
												trial. The defendant put forward 
												a bona fide claim to portion of 
												Ebirashaen Ebiradze Stool family 
												land. The defendant supported 
												her claim with a judgment 
												relating to the portion of land 
												she claimed. During the course 
												of the hearing and disregarding 
												the instructions and interest of 
												the defendant, Dr. Tackie-Otoo 
												accepted and received 
												instructions from Bosam Kwasi 
												whose claim run counter and 
												adverse to that of the 
												defendant. I am amazed that Dr. 
												Tackie-Otoo saw nothing 
												professionally wrong when he 
												accepted the brief of the 
												co-defendant and proceeded to 
												act as Solicitor and also 
												conduct the cases of both the 
												defendant and the co-defendant 
												before the trial court and also 
												before the appellate High Court.
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In short, my opinion is that it 
												was professionally wrong for Dr. 
												Tackie-Otoo in the same action 
												to act for co-defendant who 
												claimed the headship of the 
												Ebirashaen Ebiradze Stool Family 
												of Essipon on the one hand and 
												the defendant, Sophia Gordon on 
												the other hand. The defendant 
												who made a claim adverse to that 
												of Ebirashaen Ebiradze Stool 
												Family of Essipon.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I find that the trial magistrate 
												misdirected himself on the real 
												issue in dispute between the 
												Plaintiff and the co-defendant. 
												I must point out that on the 
												evidence before the trial court 
												plaintiff and co-defendant had 
												sought the same relief against 
												the defendant. He therefore 
												erred in law when he ordered 
												that co-defendant be joined as 
												co-defendant rather than be 
												joined as co-plaintiff if this 
												was necessary.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The case before the trial 
												magistrate as may be discerned 
												from the record of appeal was 
												that plaintiff and his witnesses 
												had sought to prove and 
												establish by evidence that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) the lands in dispute were 
												stool lands belonging to and 
												owned by the Ebirashaen Ebiradze 
												Stool Family of Essipon; and</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) that defendant had committed 
												trespass to the land by her 
												adverse claim of title to 
												portions or plots of that land.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Understood this way, what was 
												the need and what was the legal 
												basis for Kwesi Bosom to seek to 
												be joined as co-defendant at 
												that stage of the proceedings to 
												seek the same reliefs and remedy 
												claimed by the plaintiff, 
												especially when the plaintiff 
												had closed his case and the 
												defendant had also closed her 
												case.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The application by Kwesi Bosom 
												to be joined as co-defendant was 
												supported by an affidavit. The 
												reason stated in the affidavit 
												was that Kwesi Bosom was the 
												proper person to sue for a 
												declaration of title to the land 
												in dispute in the Ebirashaen 
												Ebiradze Stool- Family of 
												Essipon. In other words, the 
												plaintiff was not clothed with 
												capacity to sue the defendant. 
												But surely that was for 
												defendant to prove. Co-defendant 
												must seek to join as a 
												co-plaintiff.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial magistrate did not 
												appreciate the rival claims put 
												forward by the defendant and 
												co-defendant. He wrote as 
												follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;In their defence the defendant 
												and the co-defendant denied the 
												plaintiff's assertion that the 
												land belongs to the Ebirashaen 
												Ebiradze Stool Family of 
												Essipon.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This bold statement by the trial 
												magistrate is not supported by 
												the evidence before him. In 
												particular, the co-defendant did 
												not dispute nor challenged the 
												title of the Ebirashaen Ebiradze 
												Family to the land in dispute. 
												At paragraph 3 of the affidavit 
												filed by co-defendant in support 
												of his application for joinder 
												he deposed as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;3.... I am applying to be 
												joined as a co-defendant to 
												vindicate my family's title to 
												all that piece or parcel of land 
												.... being at Essipon....&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Co-defendant described the 
												capacity in which he sought to 
												be joined at paragraph 2 as 
												follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;2.&nbsp;&nbsp; That I am the head of the 
												Ebirashaen Ebiradze Family, of 
												Essipon....&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In my view, the trial judge 
												plainly misdirected himself on 
												the claim put forward by the 
												co-defendant. He was wrong when 
												he held that co-defendant 
												disputed the title of the 
												Ebirashaen Ebiradze Stool Family 
												to the land in dispute. 
												Surprisingly the same trial 
												magistrate entered judgment for 
												co-defendant and made a 
												declaration of title to that 
												land in his favour.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In my view, the trial magistrate 
												was wrong in the view he took of 
												the application for joinder 
												brought by co-defendant. The 
												application was ill conceived 
												and unwarranted on the evidence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The curious and absurd position 
												that resulted in the needless 
												and unnecessary confusion caused 
												and created by Dr. Tackie-Otoo, 
												was that at the end of the day 
												the co-defendant obtained a 
												declaration of title to the land 
												in dispute. He was represented 
												by lawyer Dr. Tackie-Otoo. In 
												the same action he represented 
												defendant, Sophia Gordon who 
												counter-claimed for a 
												declaration of title to portions 
												of the same land. She lost the 
												action. The plaintiff who had 
												sought the declaration of title 
												to the lands in dispute which 
												the trial magistrate found was 
												land for plaintiff&#8217;s stool 
												family, nevertheless lost the 
												action.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In my view the plaintiff proved 
												and established by evidence that 
												he had authority and consent of 
												the stool family to sue the 
												defendant in respect of the 
												Essipon Stool Land. The 
												plaintiff gave evidence to 
												establish that he had the 
												authority to commence the 
												action. To corroborate his 
												evidence, he called witnesses. 
												The plaintiff gave the name of 
												one Odum Krah as the over-all 
												head of family.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												For the co-defendant, one Kumi 
												Wiabo was named as the over-all 
												head of family. I refer to the 
												court notes on this issue:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Mr. Lumor (Counsel for 
												plaintiff). Our witness Odum 
												Krah is old and blind. We wish 
												to apply that the count moves to 
												take his evidence at Mpintsim&#8221;. 
												This is the head of the family 
												of the plaintiff.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Dr. Tackie-Otoo (Counsel for 
												defendant and co-defendant). I 
												have no objection. The head of 
												family called Kumi Wiabo is so 
												old and we will also want the 
												court to move to his residence 
												and take his evidence.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is not clear whether or not 
												Kumi Wiabo is head of 
												defendant's family or head of 
												family of the co-defendant's 
												family.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												BY COURT:&#8212; Applications are 
												granted as prayed.&#8221; In due 
												course Odum Krah gave evidence 
												as PW.3. He testified that 
												plaintiff was a member of the 
												Ebiradze Family. He stated he 
												was the head of family of 
												Ebirashaen Ebiradze. He 
												testified that plaintiff was a 
												member of the Ebiradze Family. 
												He stated he was the head of 
												family of Ebirashaen Ebiradze. 
												He testified that he authorised 
												the plaintiff to prosecute the 
												case before the court. The 
												evidence of P.W.3 that he was 
												head of family of Ebiradze 
												Family was not challenged nor 
												disputed by the defendant or 
												co-defendant. Indeed P.W.3 was 
												in an earlier suit sued by 
												Defendant over the lands in 
												dispute.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This came out as a result of 
												cross-examination as follows: 
												P.W.3</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Q.&nbsp; Do you know of a litigation

												over Bonkesim land.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A.&nbsp; I know that. I asked the

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Q.&nbsp; This happened 13 years ago.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

												Q.&nbsp; You lost the action.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A.&nbsp; The District Court found for 
												the defendant .......&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The cross-examination of P.W.3 
												did show that plaintiff was a 
												member of P.W.3&#8217;s family and had 
												litigated over the land in 
												dispute. The evidence of P.W.1 
												was that plaintiff was a member 
												of the Ebiradze Family. This 
												evidence was not disputed nor 
												challenged by cross-examination. 
												On these pieces of evidence from 
												P.W.1 and P.W.3 the finding that 
												plaintiff was not a member of 
												the Ebiradze family cannot be 
												supported; especially when the 
												defendant and co-defendant 
												closed their case without 
												adducing and providing evidence 
												from their so called head of 
												family, Kumi Wiabo. The court 
												had consented to receive Kumi 
												Wiabo's evidence in the comfort 
												of his home. There is no note on 
												record to explain the failure of 
												the defendant or the 
												co-defendant to call Kumi Wiabo, 
												a material witness. The 
												co-defendant claimed he was head 
												of family. His evidence was not 
												corroborated by other evidence 
												on his claim.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I find that the co-defendant was 
												not truthful and candid to the 
												court on the issue whether or 
												not the plaintiff was a member 
												of the Ebiradze Family. In his 
												evidence he stated as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;I do not know the plaintiff 
												........</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The plaintiff is not a member of 
												the Ebirashaen Ebiradze Family 
												of Essipon .......&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												When cross-examined on the 
												status of plaintiff, 
												co-defendant made the following 
												replies.&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Q. During the illness of Nana 
												Abena IV, it was the plaintiff 
												who was the Regent?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A. I do not remember.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I am amazed that co-defendant 
												could not remember whether or 
												not there was a regency and who 
												the regent was, especially when 
												he claimed that he was head of 
												the family. He was challenged on 
												this claim. He admitted he was 
												not head of the entire family of 
												eleven divisions. This was made 
												clear through the following 
												cross-examination:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Q.&nbsp; How many divisions are in 
												that family?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A.&nbsp; They are eleven divisions.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Q. Are you head of all the 
												eleven divisions?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A. I am the Ebusuapanyin of 
												Mpintsim and Essipon.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The finding by the trial 
												magistrate that the co-defendant 
												is the head of Ebirashaen 
												Ebiradze Stool Family is not 
												supported by the evidence before 
												the Court. Co-defendant gave 
												evidence-in-chief that he did 
												not know the plaintiff as a 
												person and as a member of his 
												family. Under cross-examination 
												he reluctantly admitted that 
												plaintiff was a member of his 
												family. The trial magistrate 
												erred in finding that plaintiff 
												lacked capacity to sue 
												defendant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Indeed the defendant testified 
												that one Kobina Boafo at 
												Inchaban was the head of all 
												eleven divisions of the family. 
												The parties had not invited the 
												trial magistrate to pronounce on 
												the issue of headship of the 
												family of eleven divisions.&nbsp; I 
												will not make a finding on that 
												issue. The undisputed evidence 
												showed that the plaintiff was a 
												member of the Ebirashaen 
												Ebiradze Stool Family of 
												Essipon. The evidence 
												established and proved the 
												capacity of plaintiff to sue the 
												defendant. The findings by the 
												trial magistrate were plainly 
												wrong. The appellate High Court 
												Judge did not advert, to all 
												evidence on record and came to 
												the wrong conclusion. He 
												casually looked at the evidence 
												and held as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The co-defendant stated in his 
												evidence.....that he is head of 
												family of Ebirashaen Ebiradze 
												Family. In my opinion as head of 
												family he has power to prosecute 
												claims in respect of family 
												lands.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Elsewhere in this judgment I 
												have drawn attention to 
												unchallenged evidence to show 
												that the appellate judge&#8217;s 
												finding cannot be supported. He 
												was wrong in holding that 
												co-defendant was head of family.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I find that the appellate judge 
												erred in law in affirming the 
												finding that the co-defendant 
												was the head of family.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Another serious issue of law 
												apparent on the face of the 
												record was the award of damages 
												against the plaintiff. The trial 
												magistrate wrote as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;I find as a fact that the 
												plaintiff without authority has 
												alienated part of the Ebirashaen 
												Ebiradze Family land to 
												strangers. That act of plaintiff 
												amounts to trespass.&nbsp; I award 
												the co-defendant ¢200,000.00 
												damages for trespass....&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As pointed out elsewhere in this 
												judgment the co-defendant did 
												not seek that relief, namely, 
												damages for trespass. In any 
												case, the co-defendant did not 
												prove by evidence any trespass 
												committed by the plaintiff in 
												respect of the disputed land.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I am amazed that the High Court 
												Judge did not advert to this 
												serious error of law committed 
												by the trial magistrate. In my 
												view, the fact that this serious 
												error of law was not raised by 
												counsel for plaintiff in his 
												notice of appeal does not excuse 
												nor explain away the award of 
												damages which cannot be 
												supported in law. I find the 
												trial magistrate erred in law in 
												awarding the co-defendant 
												damages for trespass against the 
												plaintiff.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is for all the reasons given 
												above that I allow the appeal. I 
												set aside the judgment of the 
												High Court, Sekondi dated 20th 
												April, 1993. I set aside the 
												judgment and orders as to 
												damages and costs made by the 
												District Court Grade 1, Sekondi. 
												The damages and costs if paid, 
												should be refunded forthwith. I 
												enter judgment for the plaintiff 
												as per the writ of summons.</span></p>

												On the 12th day of August, 1991, 
												the District Magistrate Grade 1 
												Court holden at Sekondi, entered 
												judgment in the action herein in 
												favour of the Co-defendant. The 
												Plaintiff being aggrieved and 
												dissatisfied with the said 
												delivery appealed to the High 
												Court, Sekondi seeking to have 
												the judgment set aside on the 
												following grounds:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) The Learned Trial Magistrate 
												erred in holding that the 
												plaintiff had no capacity to 
												institute the action.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(4) The Learned Trial Magistrate 
												erred in giving judgment for the 
												co-defendant when he had not 
												counter-claimed for any relief 
												at all.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The said appeal proceeded to a 
												hearing after which the Court 
												dismissed the same and affirmed 
												the decision of the trial court. 
												The plaintiff (appellant) again 
												being dissatisfied with the 
												determination of the said appeal 
												lodged a petition of appeal to 
												this Court on the following 
												grounds:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) The Learned Trial Court 
												Judge erred in dismissing the 
												appeal when it had been clearly 
												demonstrated from the record 
												that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) The Learned Trial 
												Magistrate's judgment was 
												against the weight of evidence 
												and</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) The Learned Trial Magistrate 
												was wrong to have given judgment 
												for the co-defendant on a 
												non-existent counter-claim.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												So formulated, the second ground 
												arises in my view purely a point 
												of law, whiles the first one 
												turns upon consideration of 
												mixed questions of fact and law. 
												I shall in the delivery deal 
												first with that which is purely 
												legal namely:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The Learned Trial Magistrate 
												was wrong to have given judgment 
												for the co-defendant on a 
												non-existent counter-claim.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Whiles counsel for the appellant 
												contended in his statement filed 
												under the rules of this court 
												that in as much as the 
												co-defendant had not entered a 
												counter-claim in the action in 
												compliance with the rules of the 
												trial court, there was no 
												counter-claim in respect of 
												which a judgment could be based 
												in his favour, the co-defendant 
												(Respondent) by his solicitor 
												contended that the judgment on a 
												counter-claim which was filed by 
												the Defendant was proper.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Dealing with the said point 
												there is no doubt from the 
												record of proceedings that the 
												co-defendant never set up a 
												counter-claim as provided for 
												under the rules of the trial 
												court in particular, order 18, 
												rr.3 and 4.&nbsp; It being so, in my 
												opinion there was on the part of 
												the co-defendant a breach of the 
												rules which was of a fundamental 
												nature which could not have been 
												waived either by the other 
												parties to the action or by the 
												court. The effect of this is 
												that there was no counter-claim 
												before the court by the 
												co-defendant which could 
												legitimately have been the basis 
												of a decision in his favour. The 
												co-defendant in my opinion had 
												not taken the required step 
												which could have the effect of 
												constituting an effective 
												counter-claim in his favour and 
												as such there was none which 
												could have been acted upon by 
												the Court. I wish to note that 
												based on the admitted facts it 
												would appear that the court suo 
												motu set up a counter-claim on 
												his behalf without notice to the 
												other side.&nbsp; I think so viewed 
												it is quite clear that the 
												consideration by the court of 
												such a claim was wrong. (See (1) 
												Micah vrs: Bruce (1971) 1 
												GLR.153). It being so I think 
												that Learned Counsel for the 
												appellant was right in his 
												submission that the learned 
												trial magistrate acted on a 
												non-existent counter-claim, the 
												effect of which is that the 
												ground of appeal numbered as (2) 
												which touches the said 
												counter-claim succeeds. 
												Accordingly, the judgment 
												purported to have been entered 
												in favour of the co-defendant on 
												the alleged counter-claim is 
												hereby set aside.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I also wish to say as regards 
												the said counter-claim that 
												since the co-defendant from the 
												evidence claimed through the 
												same root as the Appellant, i.e. 
												on behalf of the Ebirashaen 
												Ebiradze Family of Essipon, if 
												indeed he had set up a 
												counter-claim in compliance with 
												the provisions of the trial 
												court the court would not have 
												allowed it on the ground that it 
												did not raise competent claim 
												against the plaintiff. I doubt 
												if a person who claims the same 
												reliefs and in the same right as 
												another can set up a claim in 
												the nature of counter-claim 
												against that other person. On 
												this point I wish to refer to 
												the case of Turner vrs: Hedeford 
												Gas. Co. (1878) 3 Ex D. 145 
												particularly the judgment of 
												Cleasby B at 146 when he 
												observed as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;This case has been fully argued 
												and we have arrived at the 
												conclusion that this 
												counter-claim ought not to stand 
												in its present form.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The ground on which we act is 
												that a counter-claim must seek a 
												relief against the plaintiff 
												either separately or jointly 
												with some other person. That has 
												been decided and the very nature 
												of a counter-claim requires it&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I now turn to the first ground 
												of appeal which was expressed in 
												the following words:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The Learned Trial Magistrate&#8217;s 
												judgment was against the weight 
												of the evidence.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I think that this ground seeks 
												to impeach the finding of the 
												High Court which affirmed that 
												of the trial Court on the 
												question of as between the 
												plaintiff and the co-defendant 
												who had the requisite capacity 
												to mount an action on behalf of 
												the Ebirashaen Ebiradze Family. 
												In my opinion, having regard to 
												the overwhelming evidence on the 
												record that the land belonged to 
												the said family,&nbsp; I think that 
												as between the two of them, he 
												who is found to have the 
												requisite capacity either as 
												head of the family or by way of 
												authorisation is entitled to sue 
												out an action. I have attended 
												to the submissions filed by 
												counsel in compliance with the 
												rules of this court and after a 
												careful consideration of the 
												admitted evidence contained in 
												the record of proceedings, I 
												have come to the view that the 
												appellant had the requisite 
												capacity. Whiles his evidence to 
												having been authorised by the 
												family was acknowledged and 
												supported by the evidence of 
												other members of the family 
												including in particular, PW.3, 
												the co-defendant&#8217;s assertion was 
												bare and considering also the 
												fact that the challenge to the 
												capacity which the appellant 
												asserted was that he was not a 
												member of the family and that 
												P.W.3 was also not the head the 
												said challenge was the end of 
												the day, unsupported by the 
												evidence. I think that the 
												appellant has been able to 
												discharge the burden on him. 
												Again, assuming that the 
												appellant was unable to prove 
												that he was authorised by the 
												family, I am of the view that 
												the acts of the Defendant were 
												in their nature such that the 
												appellant as a member of the 
												family which owned the land was 
												obliged in the communal interest 
												to take steps to have the said 
												interest protected. The result 
												is that I am of the view that 
												the finding of the trial court 
												as affirmed by the High Court on 
												the issue of capacity was wrong 
												and accordingly it is desirable 
												that this court intervenes to 
												set aside the said finding and 
												substitute the place thereof 
												that in taking out the action 
												herein the appellant had the 
												requisite capacity on behalf, of 
												the Ebiraghaen Ebiradze Family 
												of Essipon. This being so, if 
												the defendant&#8217;s contention of 
												res judicata based on Exhibit 1, 
												a judgment in a previous action 
												does not affect the ownership of 
												the said family, then in my 
												view, the appellant is entitled 
												to the relief which he seeks by 
												the writ of summons. I have 
												examined the said judgment as 
												well as the other processes 
												founded on the writ which is 
												alleged to have resulted in the 
												same, and I am of the view that 
												apart from being unable to prove 
												that the identity of the land in 
												contention in the present action 
												is the same as that previously 
												contested in Exhibit 1, the 
												defendant was unable to prove 
												mutuality which is the ground on 
												which a person may take 
												advantage of a previous 
												judgment. On this point, I wish 
												to refer to the learned authors 
												of Halsbury Laws of England, 
												vol. 16, 4th Edition. paragraph 
												1550 at 1046 as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The question of who may take 
												advantage of an estoppel is in 
												general governed by the rule 
												that estoppels ought to be 
												mutual. The only persons who can 
												take advantage of an estoppel by 
												record are those who had the 
												decision been the other way 
												would have been bound by it, 
												that is to say, in case of a 
												judgment inter parties or in 
												persona, the parties and their 
												privies. It is not enough that 
												the person against whom the 
												estoppel is set up was a party 
												or privy to the judgment relied 
												on each party to the later 
												proceeding must have been party 
												or privy to the earlier one. It 
												follows that the only people who 
												can take advantage of an 
												estoppel are those who claim to 
												defend in the later proceeding 
												in the earlier action.&#8221; (See 
												Ansah Addo vrs: Addo and Ansah 
												Addo (1972) 2 GLR.400 (CA.))</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I have examined the record 
												carefully and I am of the view 
												that the Defendant was unable to 
												discharge the burden which lay 
												on her in her assertion of 
												estoppel by a previous judgment 
												i.e. res judicata and that the 
												mere fact that P.W.3 is a member 
												of the appellant&#8217;s family is not 
												enough to ground a finding of 
												estoppel as the trial magistrate 
												did find. I think that a perusal 
												of the record would reveal that 
												P.W.3 who was the 3rd Defendant 
												in that case fought the case as 
												property which belonged to his 
												deceased father, and as such he 
												did not defend the action in the 
												same right as the appellant in 
												the instant action. I think that 
												merely making a finding of 
												estoppel on the basis that a 
												person was a party in a previous 
												suit without showing that the 
												said person and the one in the 
												present action either sued or 
												defended in the same right is 
												too simplistic and or a narrow 
												view of the rule of estoppel by 
												judgment. I therefore find that 
												there was no privity between the 
												appellant and P.W.3 the third 
												defendant in exhibit &#8216;1&#8217; and 
												accordingly the finding to that 
												effect being wrong is hereby set 
												aside.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Further, in my opinion since the 
												Defendant in her own evidence 
												admitted that the land actually 
												belonged to the appellant&#8217;s 
												family which made a gift to her 
												of a portion, I think that her 
												failure to prove quite clearly 
												the area carved out for her was 
												fatal to her claim. It is quite 
												clear that the land continued to 
												belong to the said family as 
												indeed the record as found by 
												the learned trial magistrate 
												revealed. Having earlier on 
												found that the appellant had the 
												requisite capacity to institute 
												the action on behalf of the 
												Ebirashaen Ebiraze Family, I 
												think that he is entitled to the 
												declaration which he seeks in 
												respect of the lands described 
												in the indorsement to the writ. 
												I am also of the view that 
												having being adjuged the owners 
												of the said lands, the family is 
												entitled to an order of 
												restraint directed against the 
												defendants of a permanent nature 
												in view of her acts which were 
												done purposely to challenge the 
												family's claim to the lands. 
												Accordingly, the Defendant is 
												perpetually restrained from 
												interferring with the quiet 
												enjoyment of the Plaintiff's 
												family, i.e. the Ebonkessim and 
												Abankan lands which are 
												particularly described in the 
												writ of summons herein.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I now turn to the issue of 
												trespass. In my thinking the 
												acts of the plaintiff in 
												alienating portions of the land 
												and plucking coconut therefrom 
												are acts of interference rooted 
												in trespass which have 
												occasioned loss to the family. 
												Such a loss in my opinion is one 
												which may be the basis of an 
												award in damages which having 
												regard to the evidence I allow 
												at ¢500,000.00 which I consider 
												fair and reasonable. The 
												appellant would therefore have 
												by way of damages for trespass 
												¢500,000.00 against the 
												defendant. The result is that 
												the judgment of the trial court 
												as affirmed by the High Court, 
												Sekondi, is hereby set aside and 
												in place thereof judgment is 
												entered in favour of the 
												appellant on the reliefs which 
												appear in the indorsement to the 
												writ of summons.</span></p>
