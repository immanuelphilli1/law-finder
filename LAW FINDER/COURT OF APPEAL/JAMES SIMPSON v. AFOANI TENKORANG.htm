						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The parties in this 
						appeal are related by marriage. The appellant who 
						resides in the United Kingdom sometime in May 1994 
						conceived the laudable idea to acquire his own house 
						back home in Ghana. In pursuit of this noble objective, 
						he remitted to the respondent, his brother-in law, an 
						amount of (£5,000) pounds sterling with instructions 
						that half of it be applied to the purchase of a 
						residential plot of land in Accra and the remaining half 
						disbursed on the preparation of drawings, building plans 
						etc for the construction of the house. The respondent 
						admitted receipt of the money in the exact quotation 
						except that, as he explained, half of it came to him in 
						sterling while the other half was given to him in the 
						cedi equivalent, which came to (¢3,7500.00). The trial 
						proceeded to unleash vital pieces of evidence out of 
						which the learned trial Judge made positive findings of 
						fact which I fully endorse and I hasten to relate the 
						said facts in a nutshell. The firm stand which the 
						appellant took was that the respondent did not purchase 
						any land at all and that he misapplied or must have 
						embezzled it to the detriment of the appellant and, 
						consequently the respondent rendered himself liable to 
						refund the money. However, after the appellant had 
						caused evidence on his behalf to be taken, it became 
						crystal clear through answers in cross-examination of 
						his witnesses and the answers to questions appellant's 
						counsel put to the respondents that, in fact the 
						respondent purchased a plot of land from a chief at 
						Kwabenya called Nana Okanfra II. Before the purchase a 
						search was made at the lands Commission by the 
						respondent and a report issued. Also a purported 
						indenture was prepared. In the aftermath of the 
						purchase, the appellant himself came to Ghana and the 
						respondent handed over these documents to him after 
						introducing the chief to him. This was after the 
						respondent had taken the appellant to the land in 
						question. There was also an undisputed fact that the 
						appellant had supervised the construction of the 
						proposed building on the land after he and the 
						respondent had gone together to purchase materials for 
						the construction. From all indications, therefore, it 
						was reasonable for the respondent at any rate as at that 
						stage, considering events and activities on the ground, 
						to make a fair assessment that he had accomplished his 
						task and was entitled to be discharged from any further 
						obligation under the contract. But lo and behold, since 
						we live in a world full of contingencies, the unexpected 
						occurred which must have given the parties the rudest of 
						shocks. On one of their visits, they saw that an 
						unidentified agent had pulled down the entire edice of 
						the house. It turned out that the act had been committed 
						by an adverse claimant of the land. It may be 
						appropriate now to put the appellant's claim in its 
						proper perspective with regard to the real issue it 
						raises for determination. I wish to approach the problem 
						by way of a question to the appellant and it is as 
						follows: Is the appellant saying that the respondent 
						never bought the land at all but consumed the money he 
						advanced to him for that purpose or that the respondent 
						in fact bought the land and paid for it yet the money 
						must be refunded because the respondent did not exercise 
						prudence in the procedure he adopted and thereby 
						rendered the sale transaction of no legal effect? From 
						the questions put to the respondent in 
						cross-examination, the appellants Counsel created the 
						impression in the mind of the trial judge and this 
						court, for that matter, that the appellant was 
						approbating and reprobating. In one breath Counsel 
						appeared to have taken the stand that there were facts 
						which should have put the respondent on an enquiry to 
						ascertain the true ownership of the land. Simply put, 
						whether his vendor had title to sell the land to him. 
						Yet in another breath the counsel seemed to be 
						suggesting to the respondent that even assuming he 
						purchased the land, he failed to comply with statutory 
						procedures and requirements for valid registration of 
						the title.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The more closely I 
						studied the appellant's claim on the endorsement of the 
						Writ elaborated by the supporting statement of claim as 
						contrasted by the respondent's statement of defence and 
						the reply by the appellant which merely emphasised the 
						statement of claim, the more indelible the impression I 
						formed of the case became, that it typified a case where 
						a party's claim casts its original garb and puts on an 
						entirely new one in the position he takes to face his 
						adversary in the later's defence camp. It is as well to 
						stress by way of caution to would-be litigants that when 
						they enter into contracts, they must beware of the terms 
						they set out in their respective interests. They must 
						take account of contingencies and make specific 
						provisions affecting them. In the instant case, 
						directions given to the respondent by the appellant were 
						clear and specific with regard to the aplication of the 
						£5000.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellant never 
						suspected a litigation which in this country often 
						engulfs purchase of land; especially in Greater Accra 
						and its environs. So we see in the instant case that 
						while the honeymoon lasted, the appellant and the 
						respondent were on cordial terms. Bitterness reared its 
						ugly with the eruption of potential land litigation in 
						the aftermath of the demolition of the new structure. 
						This explains the ambivalence in the appellant's claim. 
						In his legal submissions learned counsel for the 
						appellant reechoed the all too familiar legal maxim &quot;Nemo 
						Dat Quod Non Habet&quot; to suggest that the Kwabenya Chief, 
						the respondent's vendor, had no title to transfer to a 
						potential purchaser, even the respondent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Then in the penultimate 
						of the statement of case, Counsel lashed out at the 
						respondent by imputing to him criminal liability for 
						what he surmised to be the lackadaisical manner in which 
						he accepted the result of the search he claimed to have 
						conducted at the Lands Valuation Board touching 
						ownership of the land. But as I have analyzed in this 
						judgment, it was not open to the appellant, after making 
						an unequivocal claim that the respondent had been guilty 
						of failing to purchase the land for which he had taken 
						cash the sum of cash the sum of £5000 from the 
						appellant, to shift his ground by an entirely new 
						accusation that assuming he purchased the land he 
						nevertheless failed to buy a land free from all 
						encumbrances. In my view, the learned trial judge 
						arrived at the right decision and I am not persuaded by 
						the submissions of the appellant's counsel to interfere 
						with the decision of the court below. In the result I 
						would dismiss the appeal</span></p>
