						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is an appeal from 
						the judgment of the High Court, Accra, presided over by 
						His Lordship Justice Nana Gyamera Tawiah dated 20th July 
						2001. The Plaintiffs/Respondents hereinafter referred to 
						as &quot;the Plaintiffs) issued a Writ against the 
						Defendants/Appellants (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the 
						Defendants&quot;) for the following reliefs, namely:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) An order compelling 
						Defendants to pay to Plaintiffs their redundancy awards 
						with interest thereon at the prevailing bank rate from 
						14th November 1995 to date of final payment and any 
						other benefits or entitlements due to them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) An order compelling 
						Defendants to pay to SSNIT the Social Security 
						contributions deducted from Plaintiffs.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) Any other relief or 
						reliefs this Honourable Court may deem fit. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On 19th February 1997, 
						Summons for Directives was taken: issues contained in 
						the Plaintiffs Summons for Directions filed on 21st 
						January 1997 as well as the additional issues filed by 
						the Defendants on 13th February 1997 were set down for 
						trial. The suit was thus adjourned to 13th March, 1997 
						for hearing.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On 13th March 1997 
						hearing of the suit did not take place. The court 
						adjourned the case to 27th May 1997 for hearing and 
						continuation on 26th May and 29th May 1997. On 29th May 
						1997 the Plaintiffs opened their case and led evidence. 
						After a series of hearing from both the Plaintiffs and 
						the Defendants, judgment was delivered on 20th July 
						2001. Aggrieved by and dissatisfied with this judgment 
						the Defendants have appealed to this court. In the 
						Notice of Appeal filed on 7th August 2001, three main 
						grounds of Appeal set out.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Ground (a) was 
						formulated as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The Court erred in Law 
						when it failed to hold that the Plaintiff's dismissal 
						was as a result of illegal strike action they embarked 
						upon.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In arguing this ground 
						Learned Counsel for the Defendants submitted that an 
						illegal strike is an unauthorised strike or strike not 
						sanctioned by those with authority to declare it. 
						According to counsel the judgment accepts the 
						Plaintiffs&#8217; contention and evidence that the working 
						relationship between the workers and the Defendant 
						Company is governed or regulated by a Collective 
						Agreement i.e. exhibit &quot;A&quot;. This document was signed by 
						the workers&#8217; mother union i.e. TEGLEU and the Defendant 
						company. Thus any variation of the Agreement has to be 
						done by both parties. Counsel submitted that the 
						authority or body to declare a strike or demonstration 
						by the workers for redress is TEGLEU. Learned Counsel 
						submitted further that the judgment does not say that 
						the strike action embarked upon by the workers was 
						authorised by TEGLEU or even the Local Union acting on 
						behalf of TEGLEU. Therefore, contends Counsel, the 
						strike action and the demonstration embarked upon by the 
						Plaintiffs were unauthorised and therefore illegal and 
						the dismissal of the Plaintiffs was warranted under 
						Article 34 of the Collective Agreement, exhibit &quot;A&quot;. 
						Counsel relied on the leading case of NARTEY TOKOLI VRS. 
						VALCO (1987-88) GLRD 100 to buttress his point.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Learned Counsel for the 
						Respondents fiercely resisted these submissions and 
						argued that they were untenable for the following 
						reasons, namely, that the judgment recognises the 
						Defendant' case that as a result of frequent power 
						failures which had resulted in loss of man hours and 
						huge financial loss, management resolved to vary the 
						collective agreement to ask workers to work to cover the 
						hours lost. That the Collective Agreement was signed by 
						the workers' mother Union i.e. TEGLEU and the Defendant 
						company. That variation of the said agreement was to be 
						done by both parties i.e. TEGLEU and Spintex Co. Ltd., 
						the Defendant. Counsel went on to state that this 
						variation, exhibit &quot;B&quot; requiring workers to work to 
						cover was made unilaterally by the Defendants, which was 
						a blatant breach of the Collective Agreement. Counsel 
						submitted that the variation was illegal and void ab 
						initio, and being an illegal act anything done in 
						consequence of that was also illegal and could not 
						stand.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Learned Counsel 
						submitted further that the judgment also recognised that 
						the practical effect of Exhibit &quot;B&quot; was that the workers 
						had attempted to waive their rights under Exhibit &quot;A&quot; 
						which sins against section 10(4) of the Industrial 
						Related Act 1965 (Act 299). Learned Counsel also 
						referred us to the case of NARTEY TOKOLI v VALCO 
						(1987-88) GLRD 100, the very case cited by counsel for 
						the Defendants.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel argued further 
						that the judgment was emphatic in declaring that the 
						suspension of the redundancy exercise coupled with 
						Management&#8217;s Notice that any awoken who was desirous of 
						leaving the company must resign was more damaging to the 
						extent that this was unfair and oppressive as the 
						workers were faced with two illegalities, namely;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Either (a) &#8220;Work to 
						Cover&#8221; or</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) resign from the 
						company</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Learned Counsel 
						submitted that the Plaintiffs were demonstrating against 
						an illegal order/orders of the Defendant. That, indeed, 
						they demonstrated in order to awaken management to do 
						what was right and legal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Learned Counsel finally 
						submitted that the judgment recognised that the 
						Plaintiffs&#8217; demonstration was legal as such act was 
						authorised by Article 21(1)(d) of the 1992 Constitution. 
						That it is one of such demonstrations: one against an 
						oppressive act, which was envisaged by the framers of 
						the 1992 Constitution who considered it prudent to make 
						it a constitutional provision which all Ghanaians are 
						required to uphold. Therefore, submits counsel, the 
						learned trial judge was right in not supporting the 
						dismissal on grounds of illegal strike action.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Since Counsel on either 
						side relies heavily on the leading case of NARTEY TOKOLI 
						&amp; ORS. VOLTA ALUMINIUM CO. LTD. (1989&#8211;90) GLRD 111 S.C. 
						in support of his submissions, it is only fair that the 
						search light is thrown on the principles enunciated 
						therein and to find out its relevance to the case before 
						me.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Supreme Court, 
						after hearing both counsel held, allowing the 
						Plaintiff&#8217;s appeal in part and dismissing the 
						Defendants&#8217; cross-appeal that (1) under the Provisions 
						of the Industrial Relations Act, 1965, (Act 299), SS 5, 
						6, 7 and 10 the agreement (LOA) was in relation to the 
						Collective Agreement, invalid and null and void because 
						(a) the parties who entered into it had no legal 
						capacity to negotiate any employment terms or redundancy 
						conditions for Valco and its employees (b) Section 10(2) 
						and (4) of the Industrial Relations Act 1995 Act 299 
						specifically and mandatorily denied right to an employee 
						ordered by a collective agreement to waive such rights 
						for new ones: (c) in purporting to declare redundancy 
						the Defendants did not follow the procedural machinery 
						set up under the collective agreement i.e. Article 14 in 
						breach of section 10 of Act 299. The Plaintiffs were 
						therefore entitled to a declaration that the purported 
						termination of their employment was null and void and of 
						no effect STEVENSON v UNITED ROAD TRANSPORT UNION (1977) 
						2 ALL ER 941 CA; and GHANA COCOA MARKETING BOARD v 
						AGBETTOH, Court of Appeal, 8 November 1984: digested in 
						(1984-86) GLRD 16 applied.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the case before me 
						the Plaintiffs were former employees of the Defendant 
						Company; they had worked between seven months to twenty 
						two years. The working relationship between the 
						employees and the Defendant company was governed by a 
						Collective Agreement, Article 34 of which states:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;When an employee 
						reports for duty on his normal working days and due to 
						no fault of the employee he is ordered to leave or stop 
						work by his employer or any person in the authority of 
						the employer before the employee can complete the days 
						full hours work, he shall receive the full pay for the 
						day.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On 10th November, 1995 
						the Plaintiffs saw on the employer&#8217;s Notice Board notice 
						from the company: a copy of this notice was tendered in 
						evidence as exhibit &#8220;B&#8221; and it read:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Management has decided 
						as a policy that any time lost as a result of power cut 
						will be covered by the workers. Any worker who is unable 
						to abide by the policy should contact the Personnel 
						Department to be declared redundant.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Exhibit &#8220;B&#8221; was 
						followed by another notice exhibit &#8220;C&#8221; which required 
						all those employees who wished to be declared redundant 
						to submit their names to the Personnel Department by a 
						deadline date of 15th November 1995. The Plaintiffs were 
						amongst those who submitted their names to be declared 
						redundant. They were also made to understand that 
						because of the number of employees involved payment 
						would be made piece meal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">According to the 
						Plaintiffs, the Defendants started paying those who had 
						opted to be declared redundant on 14th November 1995 
						even before the deadline. By 15th November 1995 i.e. the 
						deadline, the Defendant had paid about 50 out of the 
						number applying. The Defendants asked the Plaintiffs to 
						continue to work while arrangements were being made for 
						them to be paid. On the strength of this promise the 
						Plaintiffs were waiting to be paid. On 24th November 
						1995 the Plaintiffs saw another notice on the Notice 
						Board stating that Management had suspended the 
						redundancy exercise and that any employee who wished to 
						leave the company might resign. The Plaintiffs were 
						aggrieved by the decision and they protested against it 
						by a demonstration which took the form of clocking for 
						the day but instead of working the Plaintiffs gathered 
						themselves together on the premises of the factory. The 
						Plaintiffs would not go back to work unless they were 
						paid. The Plaintiffs were dismissed by the Defendant 
						Company on 24th November 1995.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is to be observed 
						that exhibit &#8220;A&#8221; i.e. the collective Agreement was 
						signed by the workers&#8217; mother Union i.e. TEGLEU and the 
						Defendant Company. On the evidence TEGLEU was not 
						represented in the negotiation leading to the issuance 
						of exhibit &#8220;B&#8221; i.e. the Notice to work to cover. The 
						participation of the local Union in the negotiation 
						could not make TEGLEU a party to exhibit &#8220;B&#8221; in that 
						there was no evidence from the record that TEGLEU had 
						delegated its powers under exhibit &#8220;A&#8221; to negotiate with 
						SPINTEX LTD. To the Local Union. No evidence was 
						tendered to show that the Local Union had been 
						authorised by TEGLEU to act for them: the local Union 
						therefore lacked the capacity to act for the employees. 
						It is in this light that I agree with Learned Counsel 
						for the Plaintiffs that exhibit &#8220;B&#8221; was a nullity and 
						therefore unenforceable against the Plaintiffs.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the present case 
						since exhibit &#8220;B&#8221; sought to amend Article 34 of the 
						Collective agreement, exhibit &#8220;A&#8221;, the practical effect 
						of exhibit &#8220;B&#8221; was that the employees sought to waive 
						their rights under exhibit &#8220;A&#8221;. On the authority of the 
						case cited above this was not permissible under section 
						10(4) of Act 299.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was no surprise 
						therefore that the mother union TEGLEU on hearing of the 
						redundancy exercise (based on exhibit &#8220;B&#8221;) quickly wrote 
						to the Defendant Company on 13th November 1995 to 
						suspend the exercise. Coincidentally, however, the 
						redundancy exercise was not suspended until 24th 
						November 1995 when another notice was issued by the 
						Defendants to suspend the exercise.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Meanwhile, according to 
						PW1, Francis Victor Kofi Gakpadzi, while they were 
						waiting to be paid their redundancy awards, the Company 
						started threatening the employees with warning letters 
						and termination letters. That the allegation is not 
						untrue can be gleaned from the content of exhibit &#8220;J&#8221; 
						suspension letter dated 24/11/95. It reads:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;SUSPENSION OF 
						REDUNDANCY EXERCISE&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In view of the shear 
						numbers of workers opting to leave and the attendant 
						production problems unanticipated not excluding cost 
						involved and disruption of the normal operations of the 
						Company; coupled with pockets of unrest and incidents 
						the company has decided to suspend the exercise until 
						appropriate arrangements have been put in place. Until 
						the resumption of the exercise the following shall 
						apply:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) Workers whose names 
						have been lodged with the Production Manager are assured 
						of non-intimidation, fair play in the issuance of 
						warning letters and non-discrimination.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) All warning letters 
						should be scrutinized by the Union Executives in 
						Consultation with the Personnel Manager.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) All other 
						termination exercise not related to warning letters 
						should follow the usual Personnel Department/Union 
						investigative processes.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Despite these 
						assurances and the fact that the exercise has been 
						suspended any worker wishing to leave the company may 
						resign. It is hoped workers will go about jobs 
						peacefully and that if they have any grievances, they 
						will follow laid down procedures to avoid 
						embarrassment.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This notice was clearly 
						in breach of the Industrial Relations Act 1965 (Act 299) 
						and the employees could have ignored it. However, on the 
						evidence of PW1 the employees were exercising their 
						Constitutional right to demonstrate peacefully against 
						an aggressive policy initiated by the Defendant Company.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(See Article 21 (d) of 
						the 1992 Constitution.) Was the claim by the Defendants 
						that the demonstration started at about 8:00 a.m. to 
						12:30 p.m. and in the process the Ex-Personnel Manager 
						was heckled; and had his shirt torn; and also the 
						company&#8217;s property was destroyed established? 
						Surprisingly, the Ex-Personnel Manager who was alleged 
						to have been heckled in the course of the demonstration 
						and had his shirt torn gave evidence as PW2. When he 
						mounted the box he did not testify that any worker was 
						manhandled. He did not say that he was heckled and that 
						he had his shirt torn. Neither did he testify that the 
						company&#8217;s properties were destroyed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After the Plaintiffs 
						had closed their case the Acting Personnel Manager gave 
						evidence as DW1. He testified in his evidence-in-chief 
						that the workers had assaulted the Ex-Personnel Manager. 
						Under cross-examination the following encounter took 
						place between him and counsel.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q:&nbsp; Plaintiffs did not 
						destroy any property of the Company.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A:&nbsp; They beat up the 
						Personnel Manager.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; Who was he?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A:&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. David K. 
						Vigar.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Here was a witness who 
						had alleged that the Ex-Personnel Manager had been 
						assaulted in the course of a demonstration by the 
						workers.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Curiously enough the 
						man who was alleged to have been assaulted had given 
						evidence where he did not testify to any such complaint. 
						In these circumstances could any weight be placed on the 
						evidence of DW1? Certainly not. And the same applies to 
						the weight to be attached to the evidence of DW2 who 
						also testified that the Ex-Personnel Manager had been 
						assaulted.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In my view the case of 
						LEVER BROTHERS GHANA LTD. v. ANNAN: LEVER BROTHERS GHANA 
						LTD. v DANKWAH (Consolidated) (1989-90) GLRD 114, CA.; 
						relied upon by Learned Council for the Defendants is 
						distinguishable from the facts in the instant case. In 
						that case after the Court of Appeal had found that the 
						Learned trial judge failed to make a positive finding on 
						the allegation of dishonesty against the Plaintiffs even 
						though there was ample evidence on record in Support of 
						such a finding, it allowed the appeal and held:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Where an employee had 
						been guilty of misconduct so grave that it justified 
						instant dismissal, the employer could rely on that 
						misconduct in defence of any action for wrongful 
						dismissal even if at the date of the dismissal the 
						misconduct was not known to him.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instance case 
						the Learned trial judge had made a positive finding on 
						the issue concerning a violent demonstration where the 
						Ex-Personnel Manger had been heckled and had had his 
						shirt torn and furthermore there was destruction of the 
						Defendant Company&#8217;s property. Indeed, he had found that 
						the allegation was unsubstantiated. The Learned trail 
						judge found that the Plaintiffs protested against an 
						illegal order of the Defendant Company. That the 
						exercise of such a right is provided under Article 21(d) 
						of the 1992 Constitution. Therefore the Learned trial 
						judge was right when he failed to hold that the 
						Plaintiffs dismissal was as a result of an illegal 
						strike action embarked upon by the Plaintiff&#8217;s. It is in 
						this light that the Defendant&#8217;s ground (a) crumbles.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">With ground (a) of the 
						grounds of Appeal resolved, it is my considered view 
						that a review of grounds (b) and (c) became otiouse.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Taking&nbsp; into 
						consideration all the issues involved, I am of the view 
						that (1) under the provisions of the Industrial 
						Relations Act, 1965 (Act 299) SS 5, 6-7 and 10 the 
						agreements i.e. the Redundancy Notice Dated 10/11/95 
						exhibit &#8220;B&#8221; and the suspension of Redundancy Notice 
						exhibit &#8220;J&#8221; dated 24/11/95 respectively were, in 
						relation to the Collective Agreement, invalid and null 
						and void in that (a) the parties who entered into them 
						had no legal capacity to negotiate any employment terms 
						or redundancy conditions for SPINTEX LTD., Tema, and its 
						employees; (b) section 10(2) and (4) of Act 299 
						specifically and mandatorily denied the right to an 
						employee covered by a collective agreement to waive such 
						rights for new ones; (c) In purporting to declare 
						redundancy the defendants did not follow the procedural 
						machinery set up under the collective Agreement in 
						breach of section 10 of Act 299. The Plaintiffs were 
						therefore entitled to a declaration that the purported 
						termination of their employment was null and void and of 
						no effect. NARTEY TOKOLI &amp; ORS. VRS. VOLTA ALUMINIUM CO.
