						<span style="font-family: Arial">WOOD, J.A.: </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is an appeal from 
						the decision of Benin, J. (as he then was) dated 11th 
						July, 1994. The facts which gave rise to the proceedings 
						culminating in the said decision are very simple indeed. 
						One Kojo Oyeman Brown died intestate on 22nd February, 
						1986. He appears to have been an extremely wealthy man 
						for he died possessed of several houses. He was also 
						survived by three wives and twenty one children. Not 
						suprisingly, it was these same factors namely, the fact 
						of his intestacy, the extent of his wealth as well as 
						the sheer size of his nuclear family which led to his 
						family&#8217;s inability to distribute the properties among 
						those entitled to them, to their satisfaction. His 
						customary successor later applied for joint letters of 
						administration for himself, the deceased eldest child, 
						Ernest Kofi Brown and the appellant, who is one of the 
						widows. Following upon an application subsequently 
						brought by the appellant, the widow by name Mercy Sagoe, 
						the learned trial judge proceeded to distribute the 
						assets in terms of the intestate succession Law 1985 
						(PNDCL111). My own personal view is that the learned 
						trial judge deserves our commendation rather than 
						condemnation. For, in this rather extremely difficult 
						exercise, an exercise in which it is impossible to 
						achieve a 100% success rating, he carefully outlined the 
						factors he intended to rely on to help him arrive at a 
						just equitable and fair distribution and so succeeded in 
						distributing the said properties among the spouses and 
						their children as well as the extended family. The 
						appellant, who as I have already pointed out initiated 
						the court distribution, being dissatisfied with the 
						result has appealed to this court on a number of 
						grounds. At first impression, that this by merely 
						examining the various grounds of appeal, the impression 
						one gets and rightly so in my view, is that she intends 
						to upset the apple cart, that is to say, even as the 
						relief endorsed on the notice of appeal clearly 
						stipulates, she is asking for nothing less than a 
						setting aside of the entire ruling and consequently the 
						whole distribution and requesting for a redistribution 
						by this court, since appeals are by way of rehearing. 
						However, at the hearing, counsel made it plain that 
						their only and main complaint is with respect to the 
						subject matter on plot No. 30 Korle Gonno. It is with 
						respect to this property that she has prayed for a 
						setting aside of the order giving part of it to her 
						rival Diana Appiah. Her desire is that the entire 
						property be given to her and her children. It follows 
						then that our decision in this court rests only on this 
						property, plot No. 30 Korle Gonno.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The evidence clearly 
						shows that there are two buildings situate on this land. 
						First there is what the learned trial judge described as 
						the &#8220;main building&#8221;. Then there is what he identified as 
						the &#8220;Outhouse&#8221; or the boys quarters. In spite however of 
						these descriptive terms &#8212; &#8220;main house&#8221;, &#8220;boys quarters&#8221;, 
						&#8216;outhouse&#8217; they each comprise three rooms and a hall. 
						Though in our culture describing one of the houses as a 
						boys quarters or outhouse would immediately conjure in 
						the mind a less superior property, inferior both in size 
						and quality and so status to the main building it is 
						equally true under normal circumstances a boys quarters 
						cannot have the same number of rooms and facilities or 
						conveniences as the main house. Under these 
						circumstances, in the absence of any evidence to the 
						contrary and there is none on the record to that effect, 
						it is safe to conclude, since they stand on the same 
						land that they are of equal value. The learned trial 
						judge gave out the main house to her rival Diana Appiah 
						and the outhouse to the appellant. The question which 
						readily comes to mind then is what is wrong with this 
						particular distribution. Why does she want us to disturb 
						this finding of the learned trial judge. I was able to 
						discern four main complaints from her counsels argument. 
						It was first submitted that because the learned trial 
						judge used the alphabetical order to decide who should 
						exercise his choice first as to which house should go to 
						whom the learned trial judge erred. This error it was 
						argued led to an inequality and injustice in the 
						distribution. The argument of counsel is that by S.14 of 
						the PNDCL.111 where two or more persons are entitled to 
						a share in the estate, it shall be done in accordance 
						with customary law. It was thus contended that under 
						customary law, the wife with more children is entitled 
						to more. It was argued that not only did the wife whose 
						name appeared first in alphabetical order unwillingly 
						obtain an advantage but more importantly that the 
						grouping of the various women and the number of children 
						they had did not manifest in the distribution.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Secondly, it was urged 
						that as happened in the instant case, where the parties 
						have reached an agreement on who is to take what, the 
						courts jurisdiction must be based on the agreement of 
						the parties. I think the implication here is that the 
						court failed to abide by this agreement with respect to 
						the subject matter and consequently the distribution 
						ought to be set aside.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Thirdly, it was 
						contended that what greatly influenced the trial judge 
						in this mode of distribution is the fact that some of 
						the beneficiaries have spent moneys on the property. It 
						was counsels contention that since they made such 
						outlays before the distribution they did so at their own 
						risk and they cannot be allowed to profit by their own 
						wrong doing.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Fourthly, and finally 
						it was urged that since in none of the groupings were 
						made to share one property it was unjust and unequitable 
						to make the order that he did and the same therefore 
						ought not to be allowed to stand.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Respondent counsels 
						reply to these arguments were that, firstly that the use 
						of the names of the widows in alphabetical order was 
						merely for convenience, to facilitate the identification 
						of the various groupings. It was therefore contended 
						that it played no dominant role in the distribution.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Secondly it was urged 
						upon us that as the two properties had the same number 
						of rooms they were of equal value. Thirdly, and more 
						importantly, it was urged that the distribution was 
						done, as far as was possible in accordance with the 
						person who was in occupation of which building. The 
						contention therefore was that since both appellant and 
						her rival were at the time of the distribution in 
						occupation of the said premises, and since in any case 
						the learned trial judge had ordered the construction of 
						a wall to separate the said properties, the distribution 
						was fair, just and equitable and the same ought not to 
						be interfered with.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I am of the opinion 
						that the learned trial judge did all that was necessary 
						to ensure fairplay and equity as far as this property 
						was concerned. I have already shown that although the 
						appellants share is described as an outhouse it is 
						virtually of the same value as her rivals. The record 
						also shows that each of them was in occupation of that 
						building which was allotted to her by the trial judge. 
						But the more important question is did the trial judge 
						use the alphabetical of order purposely to decide who 
						will be entitled to what property? My answer is no. I 
						think he chose this method merely to enable him identify 
						the wives in a very neat and orderly fashion and the 
						number of children each had. I reproduce that portion of 
						his judgment for I believe it does support my line of 
						thinking of the matter.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Deceased was survived 
						by three wives and 21 children. Using the alphabetical 
						order the names of the wives are Diana Appiah who has 4 
						children, Grace Enninful who has 7 children and Mercy 
						Sagoe who has 8 Children. There was two other children 
						whose mother was not a surviving wife. The applicant as 
						the customary successor represents the deceased maternal 
						family, the 2nd applicant represents the children and 
						the third applicant represent the survi vingwifes.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Earlier on his 
						judgment, he has outlined the factors he would take into 
						account in arriving at his decisions. These did not 
						include the alphabetical order of the names of the 
						widows. It follows that the alphabets played no role, 
						let alone a dominant one in deciding who should have 
						which of the properties or plot No.30. Matters the 
						learned trial judge took into account were firstly 
						distribution done by the family and by which some 
						beneficiaries came by certain properties and enjoyed 
						them. Secondly the agreement by beneficiaries that the 
						distribution be based on groupings, that is to say each 
						wife together with her children (bearing in mind the 
						number that she has) was to take particular property. 
						Thirdly, one other factors which influenced his thinking 
						was the provisions of Law III as regards &#8220;the 
						distribution ratios between the family, the surviving 
						wives and the children.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The criticism that the 
						grouping idea, based on the number of children did not 
						manifest in the distribution is whole unjustified. 
						Perhaps, when looked at solely from the point of view of 
						plot No. 30 one may be attracted by this argument for 
						the question may be asked why should each groupings 
						share in the property be equal when the appellant has as 
						many as eight children while her rival has only four. 
						But we only have to bear in mind the other factors which 
						influenced the decision. Namely the fact that before the 
						distribution each was already in possession of the 
						premises and more importantly the tract also the 
						appellant became the proud owner of other properties in 
						Accra and Takoradi which we are told translates into 9 
						flats. Her rivals obtained 6 flats. It would seem then 
						that the learned trial judge did take into account the 
						number of children each had. In this wise, I do not find 
						that the learned trial judge erred either in law or in 
						fact distribution that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have read the S.14 of 
						the Intestate Succession Law PNDCL.111. It does not 
						stipulate as has been argued by appellant counsel that 
						where two or more persons are entitled to a share in the 
						estate it shall be done in accordance with customary 
						law.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the contrary it 
						maintains the property shall divide among themselves in 
						equal shares. It has not been demonstrated that the 
						learned trial judge offended these provisions in his 
						dealing with the subject matter and it will therefore 
						wrong to interfere with his findings. Again, the charge 
						that the learned trial judge failed to take the 
						agreement of the parties as to who was to have what 
						property into account wholly fails.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As already 
						demonstrated, both appellant and her rival had been in 
						occupation of their respective premises before the 
						court&#8217;s final order. Does this fact alone not show that 
						they are in occupation as a result of this earlier 
						agreement? How then can the judge&#8217;s order asking that 
						the status quo be maintained be interpreted as a 
						flagrant violation of their agreement? I will now deal 
						with one final criticism namely that none of the other 
						groupings have been asked to have the same property. My 
						answer is first, the appellant and his rival are not 
						being made to share the same property. Second, as the 
						record would suggest this had been the state of affairs 
						and well before the courts intervention. And the 
						implication from counsel&#8217;s own argument is that the 
						agreement was mutual.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Thirdly there is no 
						evidence at the record that others in similar 
						circumstances were treated differently, that is to say 
						others who were sharing properties on the same land, 
						were separated and preferentially treated. Finally, let 
						me emphasise once again the rather difficult nature of 
						the exercise the trial judge was called upon to perform 
						and our role as appellate judges, an exercise which 
						naturally includes the balancing of several factors. I 
						have outline some of them. To some extent he exercised 
						his discretion and wisdom of course based no doubt on 
						the law and the facts, supplied by the parties, the 
						appellant in particular. But unless in arriving at the 
						conclusion he did erred in law as for example by 
						applying wrong principles of law or he made wrong 
						findings of fact or drew wrong inferences from the 
						proven facts, we as an appellate court would have no 
						basis for interfering with his decision and substituting 
						our own. I have come by no such errors and I would 
						therefore hesitate to disturb his conclusion on the 
						matter. In the result the appeal fails and is hereby 
						dismissed.</span></p>
