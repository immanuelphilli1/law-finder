						<span style="font-family: Arial">ANSAH, JA:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff in the 
						court below sued for the specific performance of an 
						agreement for the sale of goods sold and delivered which 
						transaction the defendants failed to honor. He also 
						sought an order authorizing the 3rd , 4th, and 5th 
						defendants to release or pay the plaintiff any checks or 
						monies standing in the name or credit of the first 
						defendant with the Social Security Bank Limited, Ring 
						Road Central Branch, Accra, in satisfaction of the 
						balance of the purchase price of the goods sold by the 
						plaintiff to the 1st and 2nd defendants. The plaintiff 
						next sought an interim order to freeze the bank account 
						of the 1st defendant with the said bank, prevent any 
						transfer, payment or withdrawal by the defendants of any 
						check or monies deposited with or standing to the credit 
						of the 1st defendant, pending the determination of this 
						action. There was an alternative claim for the return of 
						all the quantity of gold the plaintiff sold to the 1st 
						and 2nd defendants that the defendants failed to pay 
						for. As the record of proceedings had it, the plaintiff 
						discontinued the action against the 3rd, 4th and 5th 
						defendants.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The facts that gave 
						rise to the action were, as per the statement of claim, 
						that pursuant to an agreement between the plaintiff 
						company, the 1st and 2nd defendants for the purchase of 
						One Hundred Kilograms of AU gold at a unit price of 
						$7,300 per kilogram, a total of $730.000. The plaintiff 
						deposited the entire consignment with the 3rd defendant 
						company. The 4th and 5th defendants gave samples of the 
						gold to the 1st and the 2nd defendants to be tested and 
						weighed. Thereafter, they made a part payment of $60,000 
						to the plaintiff and promised to pay the balance of 
						$670,000 as soon as the consignment was handed over to 
						them. The 3rd defendant acknowledged the receipt of a 
						check for the balance from the 1st and 2nd defendants 
						and guaranteed the payment of the same to the plaintiff 
						as soon as the consignment was delivered to the 1st and 
						2nd defendants. All the parties signed an undertaking to 
						that effect, and in consequence of that, the plaintiff 
						consented to the release of the whole consignment of 
						gold to the 1st and 2nd defendants by the 3rd defendant. 
						The 3rd and 4th defendants failed to either release the 
						check or pay the balance of the purchase price to the 
						plaintiff. The 1st and 2nd defendants had taken delivery 
						of the gold; they could not be traced and were preparing 
						to abscond the jurisdiction without settling the unpaid 
						balance. They were also trying to stop the payment of 
						the check and monies they had paid into the 1st 
						defendant's account with the 3rd defendant. To forestall 
						these the plaintiff took this action for the remedies 
						outlined above.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">When the defendants 
						defaulted in entering an appearance, the plaintiff 
						applied for an order of default judgment. The 
						application succeeded against the 1st and 2nd 
						defendants, but was discontinued against the 3rd 
						defendant for it had entered appearance at the time of 
						hearing the application. The plaintiff next applied for 
						summary judgment against the 3rd defendant. The trial 
						judge dismissed the application. Meanwhile, the 1st 
						defendant succeeded in setting aside the default 
						judgment against it only to face another application for 
						an order for summary judgment filed against it on 19 
						March 2002 on the grounds that the 1st defendant had no 
						defense to the action. The trial court granted the 
						application and entered summary judgment for the 
						plaintiff and ordered the specific performance of the 
						agreement in question. It is against this judgment that 
						this appeal has been brought. The ground proffered was 
						the general ground that the judgment was against the 
						weight of evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The first 
						defendant-appellant (thereinafter called simply the 
						appellant) adopted the curious procedure of substituting 
						this ground of appeal with others not covered in the 
						notice of appeal. This is permissible but with the leave 
						of court under Rule 8 (7) and (8) of the Court of Appeal 
						Rules, 1997, CI 19. The new grounds of appeal became as 
						follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">1. The judge erred in 
						law in ignoring the jurisdictional objection raised on 
						behalf of 1st defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2. The judge erred in 
						holding that the first defendant was served with the 
						Statement of claim.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">3. The judge erred in 
						law in purporting to regularize the conditional 
						appearance of the 1st defendant without offering him an 
						opportunity to react to it in any way, and proceeded to 
						enter summary judgment against him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">4. The judge was 
						incompetent or had no power to regularize the irregular 
						appearance.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">5. The judge erred in 
						law when he glossed over or disregarded substantive 
						issues of fact, which were joined on the record.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">6. The judge erred in 
						law when he held that Exhibit A attached to the Summons 
						for Summary Judgment did not offend against the 
						Contracts Act, and, similarly, that it was not subject 
						to the Stamp Act.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">7. The Judge was 
						patently biased in favour of the plaintiff against the 
						1st Defendant and was, accordingly, incapacitated to 
						hold the scales of justice evenly.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Rule 8 (7) of C.I. 19 
						states as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The appellant shall 
						not without leave of the Court urge or be heard in 
						support of any ground of objection not mentioned in the 
						notice of appeal but the court may allow the appellant 
						to amend the grounds of appeal upon such terms as the 
						court may think just&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is permissible for 
						an appellant to state only the general ground of appeal 
						and intimate in the notice of appeal that further 
						grounds would be filed upon the receipt of the ruling, 
						judgment or the record of proceedings i.e., additional 
						grounds later on. Under the rule quoted, when the 
						additional grounds are filed, the appellant should seek 
						and obtain the leave of the court to make submissions 
						thereon. If the submissions are filed already, he should 
						at the earliest opportunity pray the court to admit them 
						and treat them along the submissions on the original 
						grounds. Thus it was not open to counsel to simply file 
						the additional grounds and the submissions on them, as 
						was done in this case. It was a step not sanctioned by 
						the rules of court. The additional grounds are not 
						properly before us and as per the rule above quoted; 
						counsel would not be heard on them. They are struck out. 
						When that was done then we are left with only the 
						omnibus ground of appeal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Under Rule 8 (8) of the 
						rules:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Notwithstanding 
						sub-rules (4) to (7) of this rule, the court in deciding 
						the appeal, shall not be confined to the grounds set out 
						by the appellant, but the court shall not rest its 
						decision on any ground not set out by the appellant 
						unless the respondent has had sufficient opportunity of 
						contesting the case on that ground&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The record of 
						proceedings shows that at the hearing of the application 
						for summary judgment, counsel for the respondent therein 
						(the appellant herein), attacked the jurisdiction of the 
						court to hear the matter. The point was not belaboured 
						upon but it put both the court and the applicant therein 
						(the respondent herein), on their guard, or should have. 
						The respondent therefore had a sufficient opportunity of 
						contesting the case on that ground.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As a matter the 
						jurisdiction of a court to hear and determine any cause 
						or matter is of some fundamental importance. I would 
						even say that it is decisive of this appeal. The Circuit 
						Court established under the Courts Act 1993, Act 459, is 
						an inferior court (by no means a derogatory term), 
						envisaged under Article 126 (1) (b) of the 1992 
						Constitution. As such it is not unlimited in its 
						jurisdiction; it can and does exercise the jurisdiction 
						as is circumscribed for it by its enabling law. Where 
						that court purports to exercise a jurisdiction that 
						manifestly is in excess of the limits conferred upon it 
						by law, it is usurpation or an unlawful assumption of, 
						or exercise of jurisdiction. Any judgment or order made 
						or founded on it is defective for want of jurisdiction 
						and is pro tanto null and void and must be set aside for 
						that reason.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Section 41 of the 
						Courts Act, 1993, Act 459 defines the jurisdiction of 
						the Circuit Court as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">a). Original 
						jurisdiction in civil matters&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(i) in all personal 
						actions arising under contract or tort or for the 
						recovery of any liquidated sum where the amount claimed 
						is not more than ¢10,000,000.00&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Clearly, this was 
						personal action for the specific performance of a 
						contract between the plaintiff and the defendants. The 
						plaintiff, for reasons best known to it, did not name 
						any figure in the claim. But then in paragraph 8 of the 
						statement of claim, the plaintiff averred that: </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;8. Thereafter, the 1st 
						and 2nd made a part payment of Sixty-Thousand US Dollars 
						towards the purchase of the gold promising to settle the 
						balance of Six Hundred and Seventy Thousand US Dollars 
						(which they claimed had already been paid into 1st 
						defendants account with 3rd defendant) as soon as the 
						consignment is handed over to them.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have referred to the 
						facts that gave rise to this action earlier in this 
						judgment. Whatever agreement the parties came to for the 
						sale of the quantity of gold was reduced into writing 
						and marked as Exhibit A and headed 'Receipt' attached to 
						the affidavit in support of the application for summary 
						judgment. There is not an iota of doubt that the pith of 
						the plaintiffs complaint before the court was that each 
						of the defendants failed to comply with the terms of the 
						agreement in Exhibit A. By this action, the plaintiff 
						wanted an order to be decreed in his favour for the 
						agreement to be specifically enforced, or for an order 
						for the 3rd, 4th, and 5th defendants to release or pay 
						the balance of $670,000 to the plaintiff, or in the 
						alternative for &quot;the 1st and 2nd defendants to return 
						all that quantity of gold sold and delivered to the 1st 
						and 2nd defendants which consignment the defendants have 
						failed to pay for&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">That is the amount 
						claimed, or the value of the gold the subject matter of 
						the dispute. Most indisputably, either is far in excess 
						of the upper limits of the court. When counsel for the 
						appellant drew the attention of the court to the fact 
						that it lacked the jurisdiction to hear the suit, it was 
						essentially an objection founded on Section 41 of Act 
						459. The judge should have adverted his attention to the 
						claim as endorsed on the writ of summons and the 
						statement of claim to find out what the substance and 
						the value of the claim were in order that he decided 
						whether they fell within or outside his jurisdiction. If 
						he had done that he would have found that in the face of 
						that objection he should take evidence to resolve the 
						issue of the value of the subject matter of the dispute 
						before him and upon the answer as found by him on that 
						inquiry, determine whether or not the issue was within 
						his competence to hear. If the value was more than his 
						jurisdiction, then he was under a duty to either divest 
						himself of jurisdiction completely and refer the matter 
						to the High Court under Section 41(2) of Act 459, or 
						ascertain and obtain the agreement of the parties to 
						nevertheless continue with the trial, under Section 41 
						(3). That I think was the procedure the law enjoined the 
						trial judge to follow when counsel submitted that he had 
						no jurisdiction to try the case before him. It was a 
						matter of regret that the trial judge did not follow 
						this procedure but literally brushed the objection aside 
						by not caring to make even a cursory reference to it in 
						his ruling, and simply went on to assume jurisdiction 
						over the matter and continue to deliver the ruling now 
						under attack.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It cannot be 
						overemphasized that the law was settled that an inferior 
						court had limited jurisdiction and an objection could be 
						taken to its jurisdiction at any stage of the 
						proceedings even on appeal, see Okomfo Afua v. Sarbah 
						[1974] 1 GLR 147; Bakuma v. Ekor [1972] 1 GLR 133, CA; 
						Essah v. Sofo [1972] 2 GLR 301; Hausa v Dauda [1961] GLR 
						(Part II) 550.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The procedure on what a 
						trial should follow when an objection was raised on his 
						jurisdiction to try a case is a matter of law. 
						Jurisdiction is conferred on an inferior court by 
						statute since that court itself is a creature of 
						statute. The parties cannot confer jurisdiction upon 
						that court expressly or by their acquiescence and even 
						where they purport to do so, it must be in strict 
						compliance with the provisions of the enabling law. In 
						this instant case, the court did not follow the 
						procedure laid down by the law by which the parties 
						could confer jurisdiction on the court even where the 
						value of the dispute well exceeded the maximum 
						jurisdiction of the court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">'Where a court exceeds 
						its jurisdiction, because the judge assumed to do (and 
						in fact did something) which cannot in any way be 
						justified by the relevant statutory provisions from 
						which he derived his power to adjudicate, the whole 
						proceedings was a nullity. It was automatically null and 
						void', see holding 2 of the head notes to Bakuma v. Ekor 
						(supra), at page 135. The trial judge could have saved 
						the proceedings if he had followed the procedure, 
						ascertained and obtained the agreement of the parties to 
						hear the matter still, which should be plain and 
						manifest on the face of the record. By not doing that he 
						offended against the rules governing his jurisdiction 
						with the result that what followed were nullities and 
						ought to be set aside which we do now.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The issue as to the 
						want of jurisdiction was so fundamental that it 
						completely washed away the substratum of the entire 
						proceedings. We refuse to give any consideration to the 
						other grounds of appeal as we are of the candid opinion 
						that to do so would amount to indulging ourselves in an 
						otiose and a fruitless academic exercise, which this 
						court can ill-afford to expend its precious but limited 
						time and energy upon. Where it is proved that the trial 
						court had no jurisdiction to try a case, whatever 
						transpired in the court was a nullity; nothing could be 
						founded on it. In such a situation, that ground alone is 
						sufficient to determine the appeal; all other grounds on 
						the merits of the case, pale into insignificance.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Before I am done with 
						this appeal, I wish to make an observation about claim 3 
						on the writ of summons. I have quoted it already and I 
						will not repeat it in full here. It is in short a claim 
						for an interim order &quot;pending the final determination of 
						this action&quot;. The issue of law is whether or not the 
						plaintiff was right to endorse this interim order that 
						sounded in the nature of an interim injunction on the 
						writ of summons. A similar situation arose in Ediyie v. 
						Honny [1975] 2 GLR 142 where a preliminary objection was 
						raised against a claim for interim injunction endorsed 
						on a writ of summons. Edusei J. (as he then was), upheld 
						the preliminary objection, holding that an application 
						for interim injunction could be applied for after the 
						issue of a writ of summons under Order 50 rules 7 and 8 
						of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954 (LN 
						140A). That was not a relief to be endorsed on a writ of 
						summons. I agree with Edusei J and affirm his judgment 
						on that point. In this instant case, I hold that claim 3 
						was wrongly endorsed on the writ of summons and I order 
						it to be struck out and it is hereby struck out 
						accordingly.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This court has the 
						power and the duty to order the trial court to do what 
						it ought to have done but failed to do. We exercise that 
						power and order that this case should be remitted back 
						to the trial court and as the claim before the court was 
						far in excess of the jurisdiction of that court, for the 
						court to proceed to exercise the jurisdiction in Section 
						41 (3) and obtain the agreement of the parties to 
						continue with the trial. If the trial judge had been 
						mindful of his jurisdiction he would have complied with 
						the law and acted upon it. This he woefully failed to 
						do. We cannot simply wink at this neglect of duty and 
						suffer it to let it pass by. We are compelled by the law 
						to do that which the judge should have done but 
						neglected to do, hence the order just made. We would 
						have had no inhibition whatsoever to transfer the case 
						to the court with competent jurisdiction to try it, to 
						wit the High Court to try it but for the provision in 
						the rules rule 41 (3), a saving device for the case to 
						be tried by the same court but then this time by the 
						consent and agreement of the parties which must be clear 
						on the face of the record. We so order as we allow the 
						appeal.</span></p>
