												JUDGMENT</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												ANSAH, J.A.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On 23rd March 2001, the Circuit 
												Court, Accra, entered judgment 
												in this case in favor of the 
												defendant and awarded ¢2 million 
												for damages upon his statement 
												of defense and counterclaim. The 
												suit centered on a claim of 
												ownership of a piece of land in 
												Accra.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The facts that resulted in the 
												judgment were that at the 
												summons for directions, the 
												court appointed a Government 
												Surveyor to survey the area in 
												dispute and submit a report on 
												it. The parties were to bear the 
												cost involved. Whereas the 
												defendant paid his portion, the 
												plaintiff did not and the court 
												proceeded to strike out the 
												plaintiff's writ on account of 
												this failure to pay. The 
												defendant then went on to 
												prosecute his counterclaim and 
												gave evidence in support of his 
												case.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the course of the 
												proceedings, the plaintiff died 
												and the defendant applied for an 
												order for his (deceased') wife 
												to be substituted for him in a 
												motion filed on 24/6/99. It is 
												not clear from the record when 
												the application was heard or 
												granted. On 4th august 1999 
												however, a hearing notice was 
												prepared for service on Salma 
												Sinare, the wife of the deceased 
												plaintiff, informing her that 
												the hearing of the matter had 
												been fixed for 19th August 1999. 
												A certificate of service of this 
												hearing notice stated that it 
												was served on Salma by serving a 
												copy thereof on the co-defendant 
												personally at Nima. Who was that 
												co-defendant, as there was 
												nothing on the record to show 
												any such party in the 
												proceedings? I think Salma ought 
												to be served personally with the 
												hearing notice, especially when 
												she did not apply for the order 
												of substitution. Under the 
												circumstances, the service on a 
												non-existing co-defendant 
												instead of her as certified, was 
												wrong, null and void. No wonder 
												Salma never appeared in court 
												till 18/10/2000 when she did. 
												Nothing shows from the record 
												what happened on that day but 
												there was another notice meant 
												for her that the hearing had 
												been adjourned to 14/11/2000. 
												This time the certificate of 
												service had it that Salma was 
												served by serving a copy of the 
												notice through the sister Jummai 
												personally at Nima, Accra. Why 
												and under what authority Jummai 
												was served was not explained or 
												made clear to the court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the 14th November 2000, Salma 
												was absent from court and there 
												was a further adjournment to 
												11/12/2000 for hearing. On that 
												day when she absented herself 
												from court once again, the 
												matter was adjourned sine die.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Then on 16th February 2001, it 
												appeared the plaintiff moved a 
												motion for substituted service 
												of the hearing notice. Paragraph 
												3 of an affidavit in support 
												stated that, &quot;Attempts made to 
												effect Hearing Notices on the 
												plaintiff have been futile, and 
												the plaintiff has refused to 
												attend court&quot;. Counsel for the 
												defendant applicant prayed the 
												court for an order to serve the 
												plaintiff by 'posting the 
												process on the Notice Board and 
												the last known place of abode of 
												the plaintiff for 14 days'. The 
												court granted the application 
												and ordered the plaintiff to be 
												served by substitution in the 
												manner proposed by the defendant 
												applicant for 14 days. The 
												matter was adjourned for hearing 
												on 23/3/2001. There is no 
												indication on the record of 
												compliance with the court order. 
												I think there should have been 
												proof that they were, so as to 
												satisfy the court that indeed 
												the plaintiff was served. It is 
												only when there was that proof 
												that it could be said the 
												plaintiff had been served albeit 
												by substitution which was as 
												good as personal service.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On that day, i.e 32/3/2001, the 
												plaintiff did not appear in 
												court and the defendant 
												proceeded to give his evidence 
												in chief at the end of which the 
												court entered the judgment 
												aforesaid in his favour on his 
												counterclaim. It is against this 
												judgment that this appeal has 
												been brought.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The original ground was that</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;(a) The learned trial judge 
												erred in not ensuring that there 
												is proof of service of the court 
												processes on the plaintiff 
												before proceeding to take 
												defendant's evidence and gave 
												judgment for him.&quot; The following 
												additional grounds were 
												subsequently filed, viz,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;(b) The learned trial judge 
												erred when he granted the order 
												for substituted service based on 
												irrelevant consideration.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;(c) The judgment of the trial 
												judge was a nullity because it 
												was given without jurisdiction.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;(d) The learned trial judge 
												erred when he allowed the 
												defendant to lead evidence again 
												in spite of having led evidence 
												previously in proof of his case 
												without stating on the record 
												whether he had adopted the 
												previous proceedings or had 
												ordered the trial of the case de 
												novo.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The ground of appeal touching on 
												service of a hearing notice and 
												service by substitution is 
												crucial and I desire to look at 
												it now.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Order 9 of the High Court Rules, 
												LN140A, governs the service of 
												writ of summons and other 
												documents. Rule 19 (1) thereof 
												provides that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Service of a notice, summons, 
												order or other document, shall 
												wherever it is practicable, be 
												effected personally on the 
												person to be served and service 
												thereof shall be completely 
												effected by the delivery of a 
												duplicate or attested copy of 
												any such notice, summons, order 
												or document without the 
												exhibition of any original:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Provided that where service as 
												aforesaid cannot be effected the 
												provisions of rule 2 of this 
												order as to substituted service 
												shall mutates mutandi apply.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Thus under our rules of court, 
												notices and summons must be 
												served personally and the mode 
												is by delivering a duplicate or 
												an attested copy thereof. Order 
												19 (2) adds that service on the 
												solicitor or recognized agent of 
												the person to be served shall be 
												deemed to be effective service 
												on such person. In law that 
												where a personal service was not 
												requisite under the rules, 
												service of a process on the 
												solicitor on record was service 
												on the party until judgment, and 
												after judgment, until execution. 
												However, when a rule prescribed 
												personal service, it is not 
												permitted to effect it through a 
												solicitor, or for that matter 
												any other person except where 
												the rules of court permits that 
												to be done, see holding (4) of 
												Donkor v Kusi [1977]2 GLR 243.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Another rule on service of 
												documents is that</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;where it appears to the court 
												that for any reason personal 
												service cannot be conveniently 
												effected, the court may order 
												that service be effected&quot; by 
												substitution by any of the modes 
												prescribed in Order 10 rule 1 
												(a) to (e), or Order 67 rule 5, 
												where prompt personal service 
												cannot be effected. So that by 
												these rules service of a 
												document may be served 
												personally or by substitution 
												where to do so proves it cannot 
												be affected practically, 
												conveniently or promptly. Where 
												an order was made for a party to 
												be served by substitution for he 
												did not come to court, the 
												ground for the order was plainly 
												misconceived, for, as seen that 
												is not the basis for the 
												application. Rather the basis is 
												that it was impracticable to 
												serve the party personally.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												These rules have been fashioned 
												out so elaborately for a 
												specific purpose, namely:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;......... to give notice to the 
												party on whom it was made, so 
												that he might be aware of, and 
												able to resist, that which was 
												sought against him, and where 
												that had been done, so that the 
												Court might feel perfectly 
												confident that service had 
												reached him, everything had been 
												done that could be required&quot;: 
												Hope v Hope (1854) 4 De G.M &amp; G 
												328 (42-44 ER); 342; Kistler 
												Tettmar [1905] 1 KB 39 at 45, 
												CA.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In Ofori v Lartey [1978] GLR 
												490, it was said that 
												proceedings can only commence 
												(or continue) against a party 
												when he has been served with a 
												notice. The party must be served 
												the proper way that is, in 
												strict accordance with the rules 
												of court. Thus Benin J (as he 
												then was) state the principle 
												succinctly in Jerigoji v Issah 
												[1989-90] 2 GLR 501 at page 502 
												that,&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . ......... Hearing of 
												a case on its merits being the 
												cardinal principle underlying 
												our judicial system and the 
												entire concept of justice as 
												known, a party directly affected 
												must be given every opportunity 
												to be heard on notice. 
												Non-service of a hearing notice 
												was not a mere irregularity, 
												which could be waived by the 
												losing party. It rendered the 
												entire proceedings a nullity.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Hence Order 70 rule 1 of LN 140 
												A could not be applied to cure 
												it.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This point was fortified and 
												made abundantly clear in 
												Karletse Panin v Nuro [1979] GLR 
												194 at 213, CA, that: &quot;The fact 
												that notice of the adjourned 
												date was not served on the 
												defendants personally in 
												compliance with the statutory 
												directions in our view nullifies 
												completely whatever occurred 
												subsequently.&quot; Failure to serve 
												the defendant plaintiff in this 
												case rendered any subsequent 
												proceedings null and void, for 
												that is a step not warranted by 
												the rules of court. It was so 
												void that the party affected 
												thereby is entitled ex debito 
												justitiae to set it aside.</span></p>

												The High Court (Civil Procedure) 
												(Amendment) (No.2) Rules, 1977, 
												LI 1129, provided in rule 7 
												thereof for change of parties 
												'by reason of death' and further 
												&#8216;the substitution of a deceased 
												party'. There are elaborate 
												steps to take consequent upon 
												the substitution once of which 
												is to serve the order on him 
												under rule 7 (6) or noted in the 
												cause book under rule 8 (4). It 
												did not appear from the record 
												that these implementary steps 
												were taken or complied with 
												after the substitution. More 
												importantly, there is no 
												evidence that Salma Sinare was 
												served with the order of 
												substitution either personally 
												or by substitution. She was not 
												made aware of the hearing; 
												neither was she made a proper 
												party in the action. That was 
												fatal to the action that yielded 
												the judgment under appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The main thrust of this appeal 
												was that the appellant was not 
												made aware of the hearing before 
												the court. Specific mention was 
												made of the fact that the 
												hearing notice meant to be 
												served on the appellant was 
												served on her sister. That was 
												against the rules on service of 
												notices, for, it should have 
												been served personally on the 
												plaintiff. I am of the opinion 
												that where, such as in this 
												case, the appellant only came 
												into the case by substitution on 
												account of the death of the 
												original plaintiff and there was 
												a long adjournment in the 
												interval between the 
												substitution and further 
												hearing, it was needful that 
												hearing notice should be 
												effected on the party who 
												absented herself from court, in 
												this case, the appellant. It was 
												needful that she should be 
												served personally.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												At the trial, the defendant gave 
												evidence through his lawful 
												attorney, after the plaintiff 
												had given his evidence. By then 
												no order had been made by the 
												court for the parties to pay any 
												sums of money for the survey. 
												Then on 23/3/2001, the defendant 
												gave evidence again on his 
												counterclaim. It was said it 
												meant he did so twice in the 
												same cause. That was an abuse of 
												the processes of court. Where a 
												party has given evidence via his 
												lawful attorney, he does not 
												mount the witness box to give 
												another round of evidence 
												again.&nbsp; Before that can be done 
												there must be an indication that 
												the court had expunged the 
												earlier evidence for one reason 
												or the other, which must be made 
												apparent on the face of the 
												record. There was nothing like 
												that in this case and the 
												complaint was that the court 
												erred in allowing this to 
												happen. When the plaintiff&#8217;s 
												case was thrown out for the 
												non-payment of survey fees, the 
												evidence led by the defendant&#8217;s 
												lawful attorney went with it 
												automatically. There was no need 
												for a formal order to that 
												effect by the court.</span></p>

												No hearing notice having been 
												served (personally or otherwise) 
												on Salma, the proceedings were 
												vitiated thereby. We allow the 
												appeal and set aside the 
												judgment. In view of the 
												irregularities in the trial, 
												complained of rightly in our 
												view, we order that the 
												counterclaim be hear de novo by 
												a Circuit Court differently 
												constituted, and with the utmost 
												dispatch.</span></p>
