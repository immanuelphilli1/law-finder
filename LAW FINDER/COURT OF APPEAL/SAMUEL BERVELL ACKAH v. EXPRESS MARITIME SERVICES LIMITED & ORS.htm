						<span style="font-family: Arial">LARTEY J. A.:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is an application 
						for stay of execution of the ruling and orders contained 
						in the decision of the High Court, Tema, made on 13th 
						June, 2002. By the orders, a Receiver/Manager was 
						appointed for the first defendant/company, and all the 
						four directors in this suit were also restrained from 
						holding themselves out as directors.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The main argument which 
						was canvassed in support of this application was that 
						the ruling and orders emanating therefrom are so 
						manifestly wrong and unlawful that they ought not be 
						allowed to be acted upon or enforced in law until the 
						final determination of the appeal. The point was made 
						that having regard to the endorsement on the writ of 
						summons and the statement of claim it was obvious that 
						the plaintiffs claim was for a collection of certain 
						rights. Indeed there was no claim for Receiver/Manager; 
						neither was there any claim for injunction against the 
						directors. It was thus submitted that where a party to 
						an action fails to make a final claim in his endorsement 
						he cannot claim what is not on his writ. That being the 
						case the learned judge was wrong in granting the reliefs 
						by an interlocutory application.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Reacting to this 
						particular point and finding support in COLEBOURNE VRS. 
						COLEBOURNE 1876 1 ch. D. 690 it was contended on behalf 
						of the plaintiff that it is not at all necessary that 
						the appointment of a receiver should have been indorsed 
						on the writ or even claimed by the statement of claim, 
						unless the appointment forms substantive part of the 
						relief sought. But it should be pointed out that the 
						case cited involved the administration of an estate 
						under a will brought by a sister as plaintiff against 
						her brother. The application of this authority to cover 
						the present case, where not even an injunction was 
						claimed is of doubtful application.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The submission was made 
						on behalf of the defendants that granted for purposes of 
						argument that there is absence of claim for receiver on 
						the writ to warrant the omission to be treated as not 
						necessary, the company being dealt with in this case is 
						one regulated by the Companies Code, (Act 279) and the 
						regulations made thereunder as well as the regulations 
						of the company itself. Therefore any act done, such as 
						the appointment of a receiver, should be seen to be in 
						conformity with the provisions of the Code.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">For the plaintiff it 
						was argued that the trial judge exercised his discretion 
						pursuant to Order 50 r.7 of the High Court (Civil 
						Procedure) Rules 1954 (LN 140A) which prescribes the 
						power of a court to grant injunctions where it appears 
						to be just and convenient so to do. The contention in 
						this regard was that the trial judge had before him 
						material which revealed serious wrong doings in the 
						conduct of the affairs of the first defendant. One such 
						wrong doing was that the second and fourth defendants 
						had been introduced into the company by one Kofi 
						Dolphyne without reference to the plaintiff. Another 
						shortcoming related to the status of the third defendant 
						as well as the validity surrounding the appointment of 
						the fifth defendant. There was also the allegation that 
						no proper record-keeping was being kept, and thus 
						breached section 122 of the Code (Act 179) relating to 
						annual returns. And finally it was alleged that the 
						revelation included lack of proper meetings of the Board 
						in accordance with the Companies Code. Our simple answer 
						is whether it would not have been more convenient to 
						preserve the status quo and treat the alleged wrong 
						doings as matters to be gone into and treated thoroughly 
						in the course of hearing the substantive case? </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We concede that order 
						50 r. 7 of LN 140A gives wide powers to a court to grant 
						an injunction and appoint a receiver/manager in 
						appropriate cases. Indeed the case of BUNZU &amp; ANOR VRS. 
						ABBEYMAN FAMILY STOOL [1992 - 93] GBR was called in aid 
						of the proposition that in matters of this nature a 
						court should refrain from doing anything that might be 
						interpreted as interfering with exercise of a trial 
						judge's discretion. But in the case before us the 
						judge's exercise of his discretion was impugned because 
						the appointment of the receiver/manager and the 
						restraining orders against all the defendants were not 
						made in accordance with the Code.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We find the defendants' 
						line of argument more attractive because since the 
						subject matter in this suit is a company regulated by 
						the Companies Code (Act 179), it is desirable that 
						disputes involving it should be settled within the 
						strict parameters of the Code itself. In BOYEFIO VRS 
						NTHC PROPERTIES LTD [1996 - 97] SC GLR 531 to which our 
						attention was drawn, the law was stated that when an 
						enactment prescribes a procedure by which something was 
						to be done, it was that procedure alone that ought to be 
						resorted to. See also ASCHKAR VRS KARAM [1972] 1 GLR 1.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It would appear from 
						the Code that the only provision which empowers the 
						issuance of orders of injunction is section 217. By that 
						rule a member, such as the plaintiff herein, may apply 
						to the court for an injunction to restrain the company 
						from doing certain acts. As may be perceived from the 
						wording of the said section, the rule is restrictive: it 
						does not allow the injunction to cover the directors as 
						was done in the present case. The plaintiff's 
						appropriate remedy for his claim, as indorsed on his 
						writ of summons, is to be found in section 217 of the 
						Code, and that remedy is against the company and not its 
						directors.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Furthermore section 237 
						of Act 179 empowers the court, upon application to 
						appoint a receiver or manager on behalf of secured 
						creditors or debenture holders of a company which is in 
						the process of being wound up. The circumstances 
						surrounding the appointment of receiver/manager in the 
						case before us do not suggest that the company was in 
						fact being wound up. It seems to us therefore that the 
						appointment of a receiver/manager was not warranted. And 
						even if the company was beset with irregularities, 
						wrong-doings and illegalities as perceived by the 
						plaintiff, the Code makes adequate provision for his 
						remedy as stated above.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Now reference was made 
						in argument to section 7 of the Code which is the saving 
						provision of rules of equity and of common law 
						applicable to companies. We were urged to accept the 
						judge's injunction as an equitable order. It seems to us 
						that the order is inconsistent with section 180 of the 
						Code which prescribes a minimum of two directors to 
						operate the business of a company. In the instant case, 
						inasmuch as the order suspended all four directors of 
						the company, is it not arguable that the equitable order 
						purported to have been given conflicts with section 180 
						of Act 179? And although the order directed the second 
						defendant and he plaintiff to offer assistance to the 
						registrar of the High Court, Tema in the conduct of the 
						business of the company, we do not see the roles of 
						those assistants as contributing effectively to the 
						efficient management of the company.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is on account of the 
						foregoing reasons that we feel the application for stay 
						of execution should be granted.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There will be costs of 
						¢2,500,000.00 in favour of the defendant.</span></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">JUSTICE OF APPEAL</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">AKAMBA J.A.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I have had the 
						privilege of a preview of the lead judgment read by my 
						brother Lartey J.A.. I agree with his reasons and 
						conclusions but I wish to add a few points for emphasis. 
						The first relates to the appointment of the Registrar of 
						the court below as receiver and manager of the 1st 
						Defendant company, a stevedoring company. By this 
						appointment as both receiver and manager of a 
						stevedoring company which is in a specialized trade, the 
						Registrar as such receiver/manager would be required to 
						carry on the trade of stevedoring and to manage the 
						company's assets accordingly&#8212; see Truman &amp; Co. vrs. Red 
						grave (1881) 18 Ch. D. 547. It is not far fetched to 
						wonder whether by the training of a Registrar, qua 
						Registrar, he is equipped to undertake to manage a 
						stevedoring company. It is in recognition of the 
						specialized nature in the operation of companies and to 
						facilitate their smooth and competent operations that 
						the legislature adopted the code to govern the operation 
						of companies. The companies Code, Act 179, applies to 
						all companies in Ghana. Section 88 of the code spells 
						out the powers of the court and provides for appointment 
						of a receiver whenever a fixed and floating charge has 
						become enforceable. In the case of a floating charge, a 
						receiver and manager of the assets is appointed subject 
						to the charge. Section 89 of Act 179 goes on to spell 
						out the mode of payment to be made by a receiver out of 
						the assets upon his appointment. Another relevant 
						provision of the code dealing with the appointment of 
						receivers and managers is S. 238 (of Act 179). 
						Significantly this section can be invoked when the 
						company in issue is being wound up. This is however not 
						the case in the instant application. Suffice it to refer 
						to S.238 (2) which states that a person appointed a 
						manager of a company shall manage the same with a view 
						to the beneficial realization of the security of those 
						on whose behalf he is appointed. Given this requirement 
						or objective could it be said that the Registrar, qua 
						Registrar, could competently carry out such function 
						under the circumstance? It is equally important to bear 
						in mind the fact that the drafters of the companies code 
						did not gloss over the issue as to the need to appoint 
						receivers and managers in the life of a company. In 
						limiting the instances when such appointments may be 
						resorted to, the drafts-man was fulfilling the objective 
						of fashioning out a code suitable to the needs of this 
						country. It is therefore wrong to import into the code 
						what others would have desired to be in the code. The 
						code is clear and devoid of any complications as to its 
						provisions.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instant 
						application, there are sufficient legal reasons why the 
						court below should not have looked beyond the code to 
						invoke its general powers under the High Court rules to 
						appoint the Registrar as receiver and manager. Equally, 
						this is not a case in which the code has left a gap 
						calling for the application of s. 7 of Act 179 to fill 
						in the gap.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The next point of 
						emphasis is the question whether the order appointing 
						the Registrar as a receiver and manager is executory so 
						as to warrant a stay of execution. The case of Mensah 
						vrs Ghana Football Association &amp; Ors. (1989-90) GLR 1, 
						was cited to us in the course of arguments. In that case 
						the Supreme Court held that a judgment is executory when 
						any breach of the orders makes the person liable to 
						attachment for contempt. This being a Supreme Court 
						decision, the same is binding upon this Court and as 
						such, all we need to satisfy ourselves is whether a 
						breach of the order appointing the Registrar as 
						receiver/manager will render those persons so breaching 
						it liable for contempt. The answer is in the 
						affirmative. This is clearly a case in which the issue 
						as to whether or not the order is executory should be 
						put to rest in view of the case of Mensah vrs. Ghana 
						Football Association (supra). For the above reasons and 
						those given in the lead judgment, I agree that the 
						application for stay of execution of the ruling and 
						order of the High Court per Ofoe J. on 13th June 2002 
						ought to be and is hereby granted.</span></p>
