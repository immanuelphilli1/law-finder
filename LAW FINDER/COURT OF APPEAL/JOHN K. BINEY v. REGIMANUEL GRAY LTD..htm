						<span style="font-family: Arial">LARTEY J.A.:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This appeal is from the 
						Judgment of the High Court Accra granting the 
						Plaintiff's application for Summary Judgment under Order 
						14 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954 (L.N. 
						140A) as amended by the High Court (Civil Procedure) 
						(Amendment) (No. 2) Rules, 1977 (L.I. 1129).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On January 30, 2001, 
						the Plaintiff issued against the Defendant a Writ for 
						the following reliefs:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">US$41,409.50 or its 
						equivalent in Cedi at the prevailing Forex Bureau rate 
						of exchange being a refund of part payment of purchase 
						price due from the Defendant to the Plaintiff in respect 
						of a contract for the sale by the Defendant to the 
						Plaintiff of a house at East Airport, Accra.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">b. Interest on the said 
						amount at the prevailing bank rate from October 5, 2000 
						to the date of Final Judgment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">c. Damages.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">d. Costs.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The Writ of Summons and 
						Statement of Claim were served on the defendant on 
						January 30, 2001, and on February 13, the defendant 
						entered appearance by its solicitor. On February 19, 
						2001 the Plaintiff took out a summons for summary 
						Judgment under Order 14. In the supporting affidavit 
						sworn to by the Plaintiff it was deposed in paragraph 6 
						that by a contract in writing dated August, 14 1998, the 
						defendant agreed to sell and the plaintiff agreed to buy 
						one of the defendant's bedroom houses at East Airport at 
						a cost of US$130,050.00 which was subsequently revised 
						to US$139,465.00 payable in stages or by lump sum 
						payment or otherwise upon demand after completion of the 
						house. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It was further deposed 
						that an express term of the contract stipulated that in 
						the event of the contract being rescinded all the money 
						that might have been paid by the plaintiff by way of 
						part payment should be refunded by the defendant less a 
						sum equal to ten percent of the total purchase price. In 
						paragraph 9 thereof the plaintiff deposes that on 
						September 25, 2000 after making a total payment of 
						US$55.386.00 he could no longer afford to continue with 
						the payment whereupon he wrote to the defendant to 
						terminate the contract. According to the plaintiff the 
						defendant accepted the rescission of the contract and 
						requested the plaintiff to submit particulars of Bank 
						Account for a refund, which he did, but the defendant 
						had failed to honour the terms of the contract to refund 
						the balance of US$41,409.50 to him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendant filed an 
						affidavit in opposition to the application for summary 
						judgment together with its statement of defence on 
						February 28, 2001. The defendant also filed a 
						counterclaim for a declaration that the plaintiff was in 
						breach of contract and a relief for breach of contract 
						for general damages. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The summons came before 
						the court on March 1, 2001. That application was acceded 
						to and final judgment entered in favour of the plaintiff 
						for the amount claimed with costs. In her ruling the 
						judge held inter alia as follows: &quot;It is my view that 
						there is no merit whatsoever in the defence and the 
						affidavit in opposition filed. I find that this is not 
						one of the cases where evidence will have to be taken. 
						As far as I am concerned there are no triable issues and 
						the defendants are using that excuse to delay payment of 
						the amount to the plaintiff. In this regard the 
						application for summary judgment is hereby granted as 
						prayed. Costs of ¢10 million to the plaintiff&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is from this 
						decision that the defendant has appealed to this court 
						on two grounds as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;1. The summary 
						judgment granted is against the weight of evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">2. The trial court 
						erred in law when in the face of glaring arguable point 
						of law and triable issues raised by the defendant's 
						statement of defence and affidavit in opposition it 
						granted the application for summary judgment&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I intend dealing first 
						with the second ground which is the core issue in the 
						grounds of appeal. In his written submission filed on 
						November 11, 2002, learned counsel for the plaintiff 
						referred to paragraphs 16 and 17 of the defendant's 
						affidavit in opposition which he described as imprecise 
						as to the issues raised therein. The issues identified 
						by counsel in the said paragraphs are (i) the currency 
						of the actual transaction vis a vis the currency written 
						in the contract, and (ii) the issue as to whether the 
						defendant who is not in breach can be held liable for 
						loss of interest or exchange rate fluctuations. 
						Counsel's conclusions are that there are no triable 
						issues to warrant the trial court's findings being 
						disturbed. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the other hand, 
						learned counsel for the defendant in his submission 
						raises issues in the computations as pleaded in 
						paragraphs 4 to 9 of the statement of claim, describing 
						those computations as erroneous which do not reflect the 
						true state of accounts of payment made by the plaintiff. 
						In its affidavit in opposition, the defendant contends 
						that having made part payments in cedis in 1998/99 the 
						plaintiff cannot be heard to say that the refund of the 
						amount be made in dollars or their cedi equivalent, and 
						that the plaintiff is entitled to the sum paid by him to 
						the defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the statement of 
						defence the defendant denied the plaintiff's averment 
						that he made a total payment of US$55, 356.00 and that 
						it was the cedi equivalent that the plaintiff paid in 
						July 1998 and in August 1999. Above all, the defendant 
						contends that the plaintiff's action in terminating the 
						contract amounted to a breach of contract because it was 
						compelled to borrow money from the Agricultural 
						Development Bank to complete the house. In support of 
						the defendant's contention that the plaintiff's act 
						amounts to a breach of contract, the defendant states 
						that the plaintiff approached it again a year later to 
						confirm that he was still interested in purchasing the 
						house. And as a result of the extra works requested by 
						the plaintiff the additional works have raised the price 
						considerably, and the house remains unsold.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Upon evaluating the 
						statement of defence and the affidavit in opposition, it 
						is my view that the defendant did raise issues which 
						could have been resolved by taking evidence. On this 
						point, I would like to adopt the dictum of Apaloo C.J. 
						in WILSON VS: SMITH [1980] GLR 152 at page 158 wherein 
						he said:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;It seems to me that 
						where the defence filed on its face is not a sham one, a 
						judge who is still not entirely satisfied, can properly 
						exercise his discretion under Order 14 rule 3 (a) of L.N. 
						140A and allow the defendant to be examined on oath. In 
						that event, the judge would have the benefit of evidence 
						given on oath. This would be a better course than to 
						disregard a defence on the file. It would indeed be 
						strange if a defendant cannot satisfy a judge under 
						Order 14 rule 1 of L.N. 140A that he has a good defence 
						if he has infact filed one&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Of course I am not 
						unaware that Order 14 rule 3 L.N. 140A has been repealed 
						and re-enacted in a slightly different language by L.I. 
						1129 which came into effect on September 30, 1977. Rule 
						3 (1) of L.I. 1129 provides as follows:&#8212; &quot;A defendant 
						may show cause against the application by affidavit or 
						otherwise to the satisfaction of the court&quot;. The phrase 
						&quot;otherwise to the satisfaction of the court&quot; may be 
						construed to mean that in place of an affidavit, a 
						defendant against whom judgment is sought in default of 
						defence would be entitled to have the statement of 
						defence examined or looked at, to determine whether it 
						contains triable issues. Indeed it has been held in GILL 
						VS: WOODFIN (1884) 25 Ch. D. 707 that a defence filed 
						after the application for summary Judgment was made but 
						before the hearing of the application was not a nullity 
						and should be looked at.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instant case the 
						judge became aware of the defence filed three or four 
						clear days before she gave summary judgment against the 
						defendant. The defence filed can in no way be described 
						as a sham. It was unfortunate that the trial judge found 
						no merit in it and chose to label it as an excuse to 
						delay payment to the Plaintiff. On the contrary, the 
						affidavit in opposition and the defence filed as well as 
						the counterclaim raise triable issues, and in my view 
						the defendant is entitled to have them determined on the 
						merits.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I am of the opinion 
						that this appeal ought to succeed. I would allow it and 
						set aside the ruling together with the order for costs. 
						I would also remit this matter to the High Court, Accra 
						with a direction that the court do grant the defendant 
						leave to defend the action, and thereafter the suit 
						should take its normal course. Although the defendant is 
						clearly entitled to costs of this appeal, I would 
						further direct that costs in the court below should 
						abide the result of the fresh hearing.</span></p>
