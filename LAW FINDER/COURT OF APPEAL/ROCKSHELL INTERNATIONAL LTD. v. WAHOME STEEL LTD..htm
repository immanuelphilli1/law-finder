						<span style="font-family: Arial">According to the 
						indorsement on the plaintiffs/respondents writ of 
						summons they claim for &#8220;(1) The delivery or return or 
						the replacement value of their building at Lawlawvor 
						Greater Accra Region together with its contents of spare 
						parts, furniture, stores quarrying, mining and 
						construction equipment belonging to the plaintiffs and 
						destroyed or unlawfully appropriated or converted by the 
						defendants to their own use. (2) Damages for unlawful 
						conversion and or appropriation or destruction by the 
						defendants of the said, stores, quarrying, mining and 
						construction equipment.&#8221; Their pleading gives the basis 
						of their claim as follows: About ten years prior to 
						filing their Statement of Claim on 15th November 1996, 
						they were awarded a contract in connection with the Keta 
						Sea Defence project. For the purpose of that contractual 
						arrangement with the government, they imported into the 
						country plant and equipment, which they kept at Metsri 
						Kassa in the Volta Region to await the commencement of 
						the execution of the contract. Meanwhile the government 
						terminated the contract. The respondents therefore 
						removed the plant and equipment to their quarry site at 
						Lawlawvor for storage and for hire while they were not 
						in use by them. They continued to hire out the said 
						equipment to contractors and other clients until 14th 
						April 1993 when their quarrying licence was revoked. 
						Even then, they continued the hiring of their plant and 
						equipment business until June 1995 when their equipment 
						at the plant yard at Lawlawvor was consumed by fire set 
						by agents of the appellants in their effort to gain 
						access to the quarry site and the said plant and 
						equipment. Upon investigation, it was disclosed that 
						after the fire the heavy metal equipment for quarrying, 
						mining and other heavy construction was gas-cut and 
						removed from the site. The pieces of metal were taken to 
						the premises of the appellants who converted them to 
						their own use. Before the respondents filed their writ 
						of summons in the High Court, the appellants' 
						representative had been found guilty of Dishonestly 
						Receiving contrary to section 146 of the Criminal Code, 
						1960 (Act 129) and convicted by the Accra Circuit Court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The appellants on their 
						part denied the respondents' claim in its entirety. They 
						made it clear in their Statement of Defence that the 
						Shai Traditional Council, acting through Nene Okuampah 
						Korabo IV, invited them to remove scrap materials from a 
						site at Lawlawvor. At page 201 of Volume II of 
						&quot;Exhibits&quot; books, there is a letter from Shai 
						Traditional Council dated 28th March 1994 addressed to 
						the General Manager of the appellant company. It reads:

						<span style="font-family: Arial">PRESIDENT SHAI 
						TRADITIONAL COUNCIL&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">To enable them gain 
						access to the scraps the Shai Traditional Council caused 
						the bush to be cleared. They contended that if indeed 
						someone set fire at the quarry site that might have been 
						done at the instance of Shai Traditional Council. 
						Pursuant to the agreement reached with the Shai 
						Traditional Council, they conveyed only ten or so tons 
						of metal scraps from the site to their plant in Tema in 
						respect of which they made payment at a rate agreed upon 
						by the parties. The trial judge entered judgment in 
						favour of the respondents in respect of their claim. The 
						concluding paragraph of the judgment of the court below 
						appearing at page 216 of the record of appeal reads:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;What has been the 
						damage suffered by the plaintiffs in this matter? Though 
						plaintiffs claimed they used to hire out some of the 
						machines to companies, PW1 never produced any figures on 
						how much was realised from such transactions. I 
						therefore have no figure to guide me in awarding damages 
						to plaintiffs. The items were plant, equipment, and 
						others. With replacement value of £14,543,991.37, I 
						shall allow 10% depreciation on the equipment. In the 
						absence of damages, I award plaintiffs 50% interest on 
						the depreciated amount with effect from 22nd June 1995 
						to the date of final payment. I award plaintiffs costs 
						of ¢30 million.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Following the judgment, 
						the defendants filed the following GROUNDS OF APPEAL:
						</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) The judgment is 
						manifestly against the overwhelming weight of evidence 
						adduced in the suit;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) The learned judge 
						erred in finding that the scrap material which the 
						defendant took from Lawlawvor belonged to the plaintiff;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) The learned judge 
						erred in holding that if indeed plaintiff had equipment 
						in Lawlawvor area it was in the particular area in which 
						defendant took scrap material;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d) The learned judge 
						erred in holding that if indeed the plaintiff had 
						equipment in the Lawlawvor area it had not abandoned it;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(e) learned judge erred 
						in ignoring the mass of inconsistencies in the evidence 
						given on behalf of plaintiff with respect to, inter 
						alia, the particular items of equipment which it 
						allegedly had;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(f) The learned judge 
						erred in disregarding documentary evidence, including 
						documents provided by the plaintiff to official sources, 
						including the Circuit Court, the Register of Companies 
						and the Minerals Commission, which contradicted the 
						plaintiff's claim as to what equipment it had at 
						Lawlawvor or at all;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(g) The learned judge 
						erred in not admitting into evidence a letter dated 19th 
						February 1993 from the plaintiff and its attachments, 
						namely a list of the equipment at that time that it had;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(h) The learned judge 
						erred in expunging the evidence given on behalf of the 
						defendant by Mr. Kojo Essah, D.W.2;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(i) The learned judge 
						erred in holding that because the defendant did not join 
						the Shai Traditional Council in the suit or call the 
						Shai Traditional Council to give evidence on its behalf 
						the defendant was responsible for burning the area where 
						the equipment was alleged to have been kept;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(j) The learned judge 
						erred in depreciating the equipment at only 10% of their 
						alleged purchase price given the date the plaintiff 
						allegedly acquired them and plaintiff&#8217;s evidence that 
						the equipment was hired out from time to time;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(k) The quantum of 
						damages awarded in favour of the plaintiff was, in the 
						circumstances of the matter, unfair and excessive;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(l) The quantum of 
						costs awarded in favour of the plaintiff was, in the 
						circumstances of the matter, unfair and excessive.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It appears it was the 
						conviction of the representative of the appellant 
						company by the Circuit Court, which sparked off this 
						litigation. However, on appeal the Accra High Court 
						reversed the conviction by the Circuit Court in respect 
						of the charge of Dishonestly Receiving against the 
						defendants&#8217; representative. I would like to take grounds 
						(a)-(f) of the appeal together, namely:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(a) The judgment is

						adduced in the suit;</span></p>

						<span style="font-family: Arial">(b) The learned judge 
						erred in finding that the scrap material, which the 
						defendant took from Lawlawvor, belonged to the 
						plaintiff;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c) The learned judge 
						erred in holding that if indeed plaintiff had equipment 
						in the Lawlawvor area it was in the particular are in 
						which defendant took scrap material;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d) The learned judge 
						erred in holding that if indeed the plaintiff had 
						equipment in the Lawlawvor area it had not abandoned it;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(e) The learned judge

						documents provided by the plaintiff to official sources, 
						including the Circuit Court, the Register of Companies 
						and the Minerals Commission, which contradicted the 
						plaintiff&#8217;s claim as to what equipment it had at 
						Lawlawvor or at all;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In her judgment dated 
						30th April 1999, which appears at page 94 of Volume II 
						of the &#8220;Exhibits&#8221; book the learned High Court Judge, Mrs 
						Vida Akoto-Bamfo, J. (as she then was) made the 
						following pertinent observation at pages 100-102:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;The 1st appellant, the 
						5th accused was charged with dishonestly receiving 1 
						Bulldozer and 4 graders all to the total value of 
						¢400,000,000. According to the charge sheet, the 1st 
						appellant dishonestly received the items in 1994.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The offence of 
						dishonestly receiving was explained in section 147(1) of 
						the Criminal Code as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8216;A person is guilty of 
						dishonestly receiving any property which he knows to 
						have been obtained or appropriated by any crime if he 
						receives, buys or in any manner assists in the disposal 
						of such property otherwise with the purpose to restore 
						to the owner.&#8217; The prosecution must therefore establish 
						these ingredients, that the bulldozers and 4 graders 
						were stolen and that the 1st appellant knew that they 
						were stolen at the time he bought them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The accused persons in 
						the trial were charged with stealing stone crushers on 
						11th day of June 1995. It is significant that the 1st 
						appellant was charged with dishonestly receiving 1 
						bulldozer and 4 graders. Surely there is a world of 
						difference between bulldozers and graders on the one 
						hand and a stone crusher. The graders and bulldozer 
						could not have been the subject matter of the stealing 
						charge preferred against the accused persons. In the 
						circumstances, where the prosecution is required to 
						prove that the items found in the possession of the 1st 
						appellant and the items allegedly stolen were different 
						from the items allegedly received, can it be said that 
						the prosecution has proved beyond doubt that the items 
						found in possession of the party were stolen? I think 
						not.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">More importantly, it is 
						clear from the charge sheet that the theft was supposed 
						to have occurred on 11th June 1995 and strangely enough, 
						the 2nd appellant was said to have received the 
						bulldozer in 1994. It is worth of note that the month 
						and date in 1994 were not stated. If these items were 
						received in 1994 and the theft occurred in 1995, it is 
						obvious that the act of receiving the items could not 
						have been made before the crime of stealing. On these 
						grounds alone, the 1st appellant is entitled to an 
						acquittal. Assuming that the identity of the subject 
						matter of the charge had no clouds around it, did the 
						1st appellant know that they were stolen items?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is clear from the 
						evidence on record that when the 1st appellant was 
						approached to buy the items, it took the necessary 
						precautions, asked the seller to produce a letter from 
						the Traditional Authority authorising the sale. The 
						letter was produced and it was after satisfying itself 
						that the sale was effected. A party who takes steps to 
						ensure that the items offered for sale were coming from 
						the proper custody cannot be said to have had guilty 
						knowledge. It is for these reasons that I quashed both 
						the convictions and sentences&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The issue of the 
						identity of what actually got into the hands of the 
						appellant company remained illusive throughout the 
						prosecution of the respondents&#8217; claim against the 
						appellants. In fact a large portion of the eighty-two 
						page written submission of the appellants&#8217; statement of 
						their case has been devoted to discrepancies relating to 
						various documentary accounts as to what allegedly got 
						into the hands of the appellants in respect of which the 
						respondents relate their claim which is in excess of 
						£14,000,000.00 sterling. I would not succumb to the 
						appellants&#8217; counsel&#8217;s apparent invitation for me to go 
						through all the details of the discrepancies in the 
						evidence of the respondents relating to what they were 
						supposed to have imported into the country and allegedly 
						got into the hands of the appellants or destroyed at 
						their instance, which forms the subject matter of the 
						claim against them. However, we would still have to look 
						at a few of them. First of all what is made plain in the 
						judgment of the High Court which I have referred to is 
						that the subject matter of the stealing charge did not 
						correspond to what the appellant in the criminal trial, 
						who represented the appellants in this case was supposed 
						to have received and therefore was not the subject 
						matter of the criminal charge of Dishonestly Receiving 
						against him. That means the subject matter of the Charge 
						of Dishonestly Receiving was not related to any criminal 
						charge against any other person. What is worse, the 
						events that resulted in the charge of Dishonestly 
						Receiving levelled against the appellants&#8217; 
						representative in the criminal trial were supposed to 
						have taken place in 1994 while the offence of Stealing 
						which was supposed to have preceded the charge of 
						Dishonestly Receiving took place in 1995. That apart, 
						the items, which constituted the subject matter of the 
						criminal charge against the appellant in the criminal 
						trial differed in quantity and value from the items, 
						which form the basis of the respondents&#8217; claim against 
						the appellants.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At page 28 of 
						defendants&#8217; counsels&#8217; written address the following 
						submissions were made and they deserve a very serious 
						consideration by this court:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;At page 8 of the 
						judgment of the court (to be found at pages 202&#8211;216 of 
						the record) the learned trial judge made the following 
						observation (i.e. from lines 13 to 21 of the said page 
						8)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8216;&#8230;Learned counsel for 
						the defendant subjected PW1 to a very exhaustive 
						cross-examination&#8230; the cross examination was able to 
						bring out a lot of inconsistencies in the evidence of 
						PW1 especially as to how the machines were acquired, the 
						source of acquisition, prices and year of acquisition. I 
						think learned counsel must be commended for exposing 
						these inconsistencies&#8230;&#8217;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In spite of this 
						observation and the fact that PW1&#8217;s testimony was 
						totally discredited under cross-examination the learned 
						trial judge found as a fact that the plaintiff company 
						had indeed imported and acquired the said plant and 
						equipment for the Keta Sea Defence Project. This 
						finding, which was clearly made in grave error, was 
						totally unjustified and not in any way supported by the 
						evidence on record. It is very unreasonable finding and 
						constituted an improper appraisal of the evidence on 
						record.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I cannot agree more 
						with the observation of counsel in this regard. What 
						becomes clear in the very long and unending 
						cross-examination of the respondents&#8217; Managing Director, 
						PW1 is the lack of creditable and verifiable information 
						respecting importation or acquisition of the various 
						items of plant and equipment listed in paragraph 10 of 
						the respondents&#8217; pleading. That is not all. There is 
						also the problem of reconciling what is contained in the 
						plaintiffs&#8217; pleading and other conflicting lists which 
						were tendered in evidence as pointed out in the written 
						address of appellants&#8217; counsel, which by themselves 
						conflict with each other. As pointed out at page 6 of 
						the appellants&#8217; counsel written address, at the trail 
						various lists were presented, which were in several 
						respects significantly different and contained much 
						fewer equipment of far lesser value than the 
						£14,543,991.37 which the plaintiffs claim against the 
						defendants.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">For example, at page 
						198 of the Vol. II of &#8220;Exhibits&#8221; books we have an

						<span style="font-family: Arial">There appears to be no 
						explanation for the variation of the value of the same 
						set of items in two instances. In addition, what is made 
						clear by the &#8220;CERTIFICATE OF DECLARATION&#8221; quoted above 
						is that the two lists would be of no relevance to the 
						case which has resulted in the instant appeal. 
						Significantly, according to the certificate quoted above 
						the items were stolen on 15th March 1992, some three 
						years or so before those items were supposed to get into 
						the hands of the appellants. Looking at the date of the 
						certificate which is in 1992, in the light of the 
						totality of the facts, it cannot be said that the items 
						listed have anything to do with what the appellants were 
						alleged to have received, which formed the subject 
						matter of the charge of Dishonestly Receiving which was 
						supposed to have taken place in the year 1994. From the 
						evidence on record, it is not possible to verify 
						accurately the identity of the items and their 
						corresponding prices in pounds sterling as listed by the 
						plaintiffs in their pleading. Indeed looking at the 
						evidence adduced on their behalf, the respondents 
						completely failed in their bid to go beyond mere 
						averments in their pleading and to furnish the court 
						with corroborative evidence of facts, official 
						documentary records and receipts relating to the 
						acquisition and operation of their plant and equipment 
						as demanded by the circumstances of their case, in order 
						to aid the court in arriving at a just conclusion as to 
						the identity and the value of the goods allegedly stolen 
						or destroyed for which the appellants were to be held 
						liable. (See the case of Majolagbe v. Larbi &amp; Ors. 
						[1959] G. L. R. 190.)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At this stage I would 
						like to consider briefly the values placed on some of 
						the items listed in the Statement of Claim. Items 33 and 
						35 contained in paragraph 10 of the Statement of Claim 
						may be the only items in the respondents&#8217; list whose 
						values could be verified from the evidence on record 
						with some degree of certainty. Item 33 gives the value 
						of &#8217;50 tons of assorted metal scraps&#8217; as £462.96 while 
						item 35 gives the value of &#8216;building burnt down&#8217; as 
						£31,851.85. This would have to be compared with what the 
						respondents paid for them. At page 200 of Vol. II of 
						&#8220;Exhibits&#8221; books, on the letterhead of W. A. Wiafe is 
						recorded the transaction between respondent company and 
						representatives of W. A. WIAFE as follows:</span></p>

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At a meeting held at

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At page 199 of volume

						documentary exhibit whose descriptive mark is not 
						visible and which is headed &#8220;QUANTIFICATION OF QUARRY 
						EQUIPMENT/BUILDING PURCHASED FROM MR. W. A. WIAFE BY 
						ROCKSHELL INTERNATIONAL LIMITED AT LAWLAWVOR ON 12TH 
						SEPTEMBER 1991&#8221;. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The total value of the 
						equipment together with the building is given as 
						¢94,600,000.00 by the plaintiffs. This contrasts sharply 
						with the amount of ¢1,000,000.00 which the respondents 
						paid to the representatives of W. A. Wiafe in 1992. 
						Indeed, at page 200 of Vol. II of &#8216;Exhibits&#8217; books, 
						there is an indication that that amount was paid by 
						cheque No. 744911 of 12th September 1991; the very day 
						the value of the &#8220;EQUIPMENT/BUILDING PURCHASED FROM MR. 
						W. A. WIAFE&#8221; quoted above was assessed. It is worthy of 
						note that in their assessment of the value of the 
						building and equipment purchased from Mr. W. A. Wiafe 
						the respondents ask for ¢94,600,000.00 although they 
						paid only ¢1,000,000.00 for the items. With regard to 
						items 33 and 35 of paragraph 10 of the Statement of 
						Claim quoted above the respondents give the values of 
						the metal scraps and the burned building as £462.96 and 
						£31,851.85 respectively. That means they ask for a total 
						of £32,314.81 in respect of what they only paid 
						¢1,000,000.00 for.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Also at page 121 of 
						vol. II of &#8220;Exhibit&#8221; books, when Lawrence Kegnon Wiafe, 
						son of the late W. A. Wiafe was asked in 
						cross-examination whether the items at the quarry site 
						were scraps or workable he replied that they were 
						scraps. He also stated that thieves were pilfering some 
						parts. The cross-examination of P.W.2, Samuel Douglas 
						Ntiamoah at page 124 of the record of appeal produces 
						the following result.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Q. At the time you 
						disposed of the items were the equipment in workable 
						condition?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A. Since 1961 all the 
						equipment and machine had been abandoned and moreover in 
						between there had been a fire outbreak demolishing 
						things there&#8221;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">That, of course, 
						suggests that there had been fire outbreak at the quarry 
						site before W.A. Wiafe sold what was left of his 
						equipment for his stone quarrying business and the 
						structures on the land to the plaintiff. This implies 
						that the respondents&#8217; contention that the appellants&#8217; 
						agents were responsible for the alleged fire at the 
						quarry site, which destroyed the respondents&#8217; plant and 
						equipment, has to be looked at critically. I his 
						judgment, the learned trial judge explains how he 
						arrived at the value of the items, which form the 
						subject matter of the respondents&#8217; claim, as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;I now come to the 
						value of the plant and equipment lost by the plaintiffs. 
						At page 10 of the statement of claim, the plaintiffs 
						have given the replacement value of items lost or 
						destroyed as ¢14,543,991.37. I have already referred to 
						exhs. K &#8211; K16. The Keta Sea Defence Project contract sum 
						was ¢1,623,795,83335 made up of local currency of 
						¢730,708,126.00 and foreign currency of $15,668,205.43. 
						If the plant and equipment were mortgaged as collateral 
						for the performance of the contract, then surely the 
						value of the plant and equipment so mortgaged would 
						either be equal to, or more than the contract sum. It 
						would therefore not be out of place if plaintiffs say 
						the value of plant and equipment was over £14 million. 
						The pro forma invoices give credence to this.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I quite agree with 
						counsel for the appellants that the pro forma invoices, 
						which the learned trial judge relied on, would have 
						little or nothing to do with providing the prices of the 
						items, which are listed in the Statement of Claim. The 
						uncertainty, which shrouded the exact nature of items, 
						which got into the hands of the appellant company and 
						for which they could be held accountable in this case 
						was exposed during the criminal prosecution of the 
						appellant company&#8217;s representative and others before the 
						Circuit Court. In the criminal trial before the Circuit 
						Court, Stephen Awuku, Detective Chief Inspector, PW6 
						testified on behalf of the prosecution. His 
						cross-examination by counsel for the 5th Accused person 
						(who was a representative of the appellant company) 
						brought out a revealing background to the prosecution of 
						the representative of the defendant company on the 
						charge of Dishonestly Receiving. When PW6 was cross- 
						examined on 15th May 1996, he gave the following answers 
						at page 141 of Vol. II of &#8216;Exhibits&#8217; books:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Q. Did you discover 
						some of these items at Wahome Steel?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A. No. because Wahome 
						had by them melted them. I asked Mr. Vandyck about the 
						items and he said they couldn't be traced.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q. Did you receive a

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A. Yes&#8212;in the course of

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The nature of the

						are responsible for the loss and destruction of all 
						their plant and equipment listed in paragraph 10 of the 
						Statement of Claim and therefore liable to pay for their 
						replacement value. However, the evidence on record shows 
						that there is an indication that some pieces of metal 
						scrap were found in the possession of others who faced 
						criminal prosecution. It is therefore necessary to look 
						closely at the evidence on record with the view of 
						ascertaining what allegedly came into the hands of the 
						appellants or what was destroyed at their instance.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the course of the 
						criminal proceedings before the Circuit Court, there was 
						the impression that the respondents got to know what 
						exactly got into the hands of the appellant company 
						during the criminal investigation. In fact as revealed 
						by the cross-examination of PW6 quoted above, the 
						prosecution was positive that Paul Ackah, a former 
						employee of the appellant company, made a statement to 
						the police and that that brought to their knowledge what 
						the defendants took away. Therefore, to make everything 
						clear, it would not be out of place if the whole of the 
						testimony of Paul Ackah, who testified in the criminal 
						trial before the Circuit Court as the seventh 
						prosecution witness (PW7), were reproduced. We have his 
						evidence on oath at pages 147 and 148 of Vol. II of 
						&#8220;Exhibits&#8221; books as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;My name is Paul Ackah. 
						I work at Wahome Steel as a welder&#8230; I&nbsp; know Mr. Vandyck 
						the 5th Accused of all the Accused persons. I know 
						Awuah, a driver at Wahome. I know A5 as my Scrap Manager 
						at Wahome Steel. On 9th August 1994, I was still 
						employed at Wahome. Yes on the day in question&#8212;A5 
						assigned me duties at Shai area. I started this job but 
						I did not complete. On the first day I went, the place 
						was bush, so I was not able to cut the scrap. I was 
						there on 6 occasions. I don&#8217;t remember the date I went 
						the first time but I went there on 6 occasions. On the 
						second occasion too the place was still bush so I 
						returned on the third day, it was still bush. On the 4th 
						day when I went the bush was burnt. The remnants that 
						were not burnt were the ones that I cut. On the 5th day, 
						I continued&nbsp; with the cutting because I didn&#8217;t complete 
						it on the 4th day. On the 6th day I went to continue 
						with the work, I was on the work when a certain chief 
						and his elders came and asked me who authorized me to do 
						the work and I replied that it was my employers Wahome. 
						I went with gas cutter, oxygen, and acetylene and hose, 
						shifting spanner. I went with another person to 
						undertake the assignment by name Thomas Debra. These 
						inputs were carried to the site by the company&#8217;s car. I 
						was only assigned one vehicle for the job but I don&#8217;t 
						remember the number. The driver is called Isaac Awuah. I 
						also went there with one Wisdom another driver in the 
						company&#8230; Yes, in the course of investigations the police 
						contacted me and I gave a statement as I have narrated 
						to this court.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He gave the following 
						answers in cross-examination:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q. You said on the 6th 
						day whilst there, a chief and elders came to confront 
						you&#8212; do you know the chief?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A. Yes&#8212;Nene Nagai Kassa 
						(PW5).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q. Did he confront you?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A. He asked who 
						authorized me and I told him Wahome Steel sent me. He 
						told me holding sticks, and told me that I shouldn&#8217;t 
						come to work there again. Then the chief identified my 
						other worker as being Adagbe and said we are lucky so as 
						they brought sticks and other things, we were frightened 
						and never go there again.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q. After this incident, 
						did you meet the chief anywhere?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A. Later our company 
						sent me to Kpando when we were returning, we looked at 
						the site and saw PW5 and some elders and a truck parked 
						there.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Q. Did you see anything 
						in the truck?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A. I did not see 
						anything in the truck, as we were passing by.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">We are now aware of 
						what PW7 told the Circuit Court in the course of the 
						criminal proceedings and it cannot be said that the 
						information he supposedly gave to the police as to the 
						amount of metal he worked on represented in any way the 
						list of items contained in paragraph 10 of the Statement 
						of Claim. It is interesting to note that according to 
						PW7 he went to the quarry site in August 1994 when he 
						was confronted by PW5 and some elders. It must be 
						remembered that he testified on behalf of the 
						prosecution and he was not treated as a hostile witness. 
						The effect of his testimony is that as far back as 
						August 1994 the respondents&#8217; accredited caretaker, Nene 
						Nagai Kassa VII (PW5) became aware of the activities of 
						the appellants&#8217; employees at the respondents&#8217; quarry 
						site and he did not deem it necessary to inform the 
						respondents&#8217; managing director, (PW1) who had appointed 
						him caretaker of the equipment at the quarry site, about 
						it. I am quite sure that as caretaker, if it had come to 
						the notice of P.W.5 that the appellants&#8217; employees had, 
						by their activities at the quarry site, caused what 
						amounted to total loss or destruction of the plant and 
						equipment belonging to the respondent company at the 
						quarry site, he would have passed on the information to 
						the company&#8217;s managing director. In fact as brought out 
						by the cross-examination of PW6, at the inception of the 
						criminal prosecution before the Circuit Court the 
						defendant company was not involved in any way. The 
						respondents&#8217; managing director had not been informed 
						about what the appellants&#8217; employees had done at the 
						quarry site in 1994. On 11th June 1995 Nene Nagai Kassa 
						VII, PW5 was in the company PW1 when they saw some 
						persons who were in the process of loading some metal at 
						the quarry site onto a vehicle to be taken away. 
						Obviously, those persons did not come from the appellant 
						company. I do not therefore think that there is any 
						justification for holding the appellants responsible for 
						anything that might have been taken away from the quarry 
						site.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Among the issues that 
						were listed for trial at the Summons for Direction stage 
						in the court below it is the eleventh one, which to me 
						is the most pertinent. It reads: &#8220;Whether or not the 
						Defendants are responsible for all the items of plant 
						and equipment and other stores including a building that 
						were burnt down, destroyed or cut by gas welding and 
						transferred to the Defendants&#8217; premises for subsequent 
						conversion without the plaintiffs&#8217; knowledge or 
						consent.&#8221; As demonstrated in this appeal there is 
						nothing to show by way of evidence that the appellants 
						had anything to do with the rather long list of plant 
						and equipment, which were allegedly stolen from the 
						quarry site or destroyed by fire at that place. The 
						appeal therefore succeeds. This takes care of all the 
						other grounds of appeal. The judgment and costs of the 
						court below are set aside.</span></p>
