												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The facts that led to the 
												mounting of the action in the 
												instant appeal are fairly simple 
												and straight forward.&nbsp; These are 
												that Hasnem Co&#8217;s. Manager 
												entered the premises of S.A.T. 
												in Sekondi bought and paid for 6 
												chairs on 16th August 1997.&nbsp; He 
												took immediate delivery of 2 
												chairs and was advised by the 
												storekeeper of S.A.T. to send a 
												vehicle at his expense to 
												collect the four remaining 
												&#8220;executive swivel secretarial 
												chairs&#8221; the following day.&nbsp; 
												Accordingly, a vehicle was sent 
												to S.A.T. the next day to 
												collect and take delivery of the 
												four special chairs.&nbsp; The driver 
												was sent back without the four 
												chairs.&nbsp; After several fruitless 
												and disappointing journeys, 
												needless to add time consuming 
												and expensive journeys and when 
												it became obvious that S.A.T. 
												was in no position to honour and 
												perform its obligation under the 
												agreement Hasnem sued S.A.T. on 
												16th June 1989, that is, after a 
												period of ten years had 
												elapsed.&nbsp; It claimed an order of 
												specific performance directed at 
												S.A.T. as claimed and stated in 
												its writ of summons.&nbsp; The case 
												was heard on the merits.&nbsp; The 
												trial magistrate entered 
												judgment for Hasnem.&nbsp; In place 
												of an order for specific 
												performance which was the relief 
												sought by the summons he ordered 
												S.A.T. to pay damages in the sum 
												of ¢1.5 million to Hasnem Co. 
												together with costs. S.A.T. Co. 
												was dissatisfied and aggrieved 
												by the judgment.&nbsp; It appealed to 
												the High Court, Cape Coast.&nbsp; The 
												appeal was heard on the merits.&nbsp; 
												The appellate court dismissed 
												the appeal and affirmed the 
												judgment of the District Court.&nbsp; 
												It is against the judgment of 
												the High Court, Cape Coast that 
												S.A.T. Co. appealed further to 
												this court on eight grounds of 
												appeal and one additional ground 
												of appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Before I deal with the appeal in 
												the merits, I must consider an 
												issue of law raised, in limine, 
												by counsel for Hasnem Co. The 
												issue was formulated as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;In response to paragraph 2 &#8230;&#8230;.. 
												It is submitted that to the 
												extent that no leave of the 
												court was sought and granted to 
												argue additional grounds of 
												appeal filed on 30th October 
												1998, the court should ignore 
												all the arguments purported to 
												be advanced in support of the 
												said additional grounds of 
												appeal&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In reply, counsel for S.A.T. Co. 
												stated that by consent of 
												lawyers for the parties herein, 
												the Court of Appeal had ruled 
												that the additional grounds 
												filed without leave of the Court 
												be admitted to form part of the 
												record of appeal.&nbsp; He did not 
												exhibit a certified true copy of 
												the said ruling of this Court in 
												support of his submission.&nbsp; Be 
												that as it may, since counsel 
												for S.A.T. Co. is an officer of 
												the Court, I have no doubt that 
												he stated the true position as 
												he was in duty bound to do and 
												act.&nbsp; In any case, the objection 
												was raised in open court when 
												the appeal was called for 
												hearing.&nbsp; I take the view that 
												the objection was abandoned 
												counsel for Hasnem.&nbsp; I therefore 
												over rule the objection and hold 
												that the additional grounds 
												filed without leave of the Court 
												of Appeal are properly before 
												this court. I admit the 
												additional grounds of appeal as 
												part of the record of appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In his statement of case on 
												behalf of S.A.T. Co., counsel 
												submitted that, &#8220;6.&nbsp; The 
												District Magistrate &#8230;awarded 
												damages to the plaintiff &#8230;.. The 
												authority for the exercise of 
												this power was founded on the 
												case of Lartey v. Bannerman 
												(1976) 2 GLR 461, even though 
												there was no alternative relief 
												for damages as was the case in 
												the circumstances of the case of 
												Lartey v. Bannerman.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												He next argued in paragraph 7 
												that the trial court wrongly 
												applied the law stated in Dam v. 
												Addo (1962) 2 GLR 200 at 203 to 
												206.&nbsp; He concluded that the 
												trial magistrate erred in law 
												when he failed to dismiss the 
												claim of Hasnem Co. Based on the 
												above he submitted that the 
												appellate court fell into error 
												when it affirmed the judgement 
												of the trial court. He argued 
												that the appellate court erred 
												in law when it affirmed the 
												award of damages to Hasnem Co. 
												since it did not seek that 
												relief by its writ of summons.&nbsp; 
												In reply, counsel for Hasnem Co. 
												submitted that the appellate 
												High Court did not err in law 
												when it affirmed the award of 
												damages. He based himself on the 
												principle of restitution in 
												integrum.&nbsp; He stated that the 
												case of Dan v. Addo could be 
												distinguished from the instant 
												Case.&nbsp; I find the submission 
												that the trial magistrate erred 
												when he applied the statement of 
												the law in Lartey v. Bannerman 
												in determining the case before 
												him is plainly misconceived. A 
												careful and critical reading of 
												the Lartey case will show that a 
												court minded to do justice and, 
												in particular, to avoid 
												multiplicity of actions must, 
												suo moto, order or make such 
												amendments as would resolve and 
												determine the real issue in 
												dispute between the feuding 
												parties before it.&nbsp; At page 467 
												of the report of the Lartey 
												case, Amissah JA. stated the 
												legal position thus:- </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;We in this court have power, 
												under Rule 31 of the Court of 
												Appeal Rules, 1962 (L.I. 28) 
												where we think that the 
												interests of justice demand it, 
												to amend the record in the case 
												so as to determine the real 
												question in controversy.&nbsp; In my 
												opinion this is a case in which 
												our powers should be exercised.&nbsp; 
												It is a procedural matter.&nbsp; The 
												substance of the case is not 
												changed in any way. I would 
												accordingly amend the writ and 
												pleadings by substituting the 
												name of Joseph Blankson Lartey 
												for Patience Larle Lartey.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Sowah JA. expressed the same 
												opinion when he stated:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;I am in agreement with the 
												order of the court substituting 
												Blankson Lartey for the 
												plaintiff &#8230;&#8230;&#8221; at page 467 of the 
												report.&nbsp; Jiagge JA, agreed with 
												the order made by the court.&nbsp; 
												The issue of law raised in the 
												Lartey case was whether or not 
												the Court had power, suo moto, 
												to amend the writ and the 
												pleadings in the appropriate 
												case. The answer is that Rule 31 
												of L.I. 218 and R.31 of C.I. 19 
												empowers the court of appeal to 
												exercise that power</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is trite learning that the 
												Court would and should exercise 
												this power in the appropriate 
												case.&nbsp; I start with a 
												consideration of some only of 
												early cases.&nbsp; In Nkyi XI v. Kuma 
												(1959) G.L.R. the Court of 
												Appeal amended the writ of 
												summons by adding a declaration 
												title, a relief that the 
												plaintiff had not pacifically 
												claimed by the respondent.&nbsp; In 
												the case of Dove v. Wuta-Ofei 
												(1966) G.L.R. 299 S.C. the 
												former Supreme Court, of its own 
												motion, amended the title of the 
												suit by adding the words &#8220;for 
												himself and on behalf of his 
												wife Mrs. Ofei&#8221;. At p. 317 of 
												the report, Apaloo J.S.C. (as he 
												them was) said:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;That (amendment) would put an 
												end to that objection of the 
												plaintiff&#8217;s wife bringing an 
												action of her own to seek 
												protection in respect of that 
												part of the building that lies 
												on her plot&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Apaloo J.S.C. applied the 
												decision of the West African 
												Court of Appeal in Akyirefie v. 
												Paramount Stool of Breman-Esiam 
												(1951) 13 WACA 331.&nbsp; See also 
												the case of Ababio IV v. Quartey 
												(1916) P.C. 74 28: 40.&nbsp; I must 
												point out that the power granted 
												to the Court of Appeal by Rule 
												31 of L.I. 218 was restored to 
												this Court by Rule 31 of C.I. 
												19.&nbsp; In the case of Mamudu 
												Wangara v. Gyato Wangara (1982 &#8211; 
												83) 1 G.L.R. 639 the Court of 
												Appeal held at holdings (1) and 
												(4) as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;(1) An appeal is by way of

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;(1) An appeal is by way of

												appellate court was virtually in 
												the same position as if the

												whole case and not merely the 
												points as to which the appeal 
												was brought&#8230;..</span></p>

												The decided cases all go to show 
												that the appellate court in 
												order to avoid multiplicity of 
												actions could amend any writ of 
												summons where it was appropriate 
												to do so, and in case where it 
												would not cause injustice to the 
												other party.&nbsp; The principles of 
												law stated in these cases may be 
												applied in the instant case.&nbsp; On 
												the undisputed facts pleaded and 
												the evidence on record it is 
												plain and clear beyond any 
												argument that this was a simple 
												case of breach of contract.&nbsp; The 
												remedies open to an aggrieved 
												party under the Sale of Goods 
												Act 1962 (Act 137) included a 
												claim for damages for breach of 
												the contract.&nbsp; Solicitors acting 
												for the Hasnem Co. failed and or 
												omitted to seek leave to amend 
												the writ to make this claim 
												namely, damages for breach of 
												contract up to the hearing of 
												the plaint at the District 
												Court.&nbsp; At the appellate High 
												Court, counsel for Hasnem Co. 
												did not advert to Act 137 and 
												seek to amend the endorsement in 
												the writ of summons with leave 
												of that court in order to claim 
												damages in the alternative; to 
												avoid multiplicity of actions.&nbsp; 
												This court must exercise its 
												powers under Rule 31 of C.I. 
												19.&nbsp; On the record, the 
												undisputed evidence satisfied me 
												that S.A.T. Co. breached the 
												contract to supply and deliver 
												to Hasnem Co. four executive 
												swivel secretarial chairs and 
												ought to be condemned to pay 
												damages for the breach.&nbsp; See on 
												this SS. 15 (1) and 16(4) of Act 
												137.&nbsp; See further SS. 53 &amp; 54 of 
												Act 137.&nbsp; I will amend the writ 
												to include in the alternative 
												under head (b) a claim for 
												damages for breach of contract.&nbsp; 
												The law governing the breach of 
												contract is stated at S.15 of 
												Act 157 thus:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8216;15(1) unless otherwise agreed 
												the seller must be ready and 
												willing to deliver the goods in 
												exchange for the price&#8221;.&nbsp; In the 
												instant case the goods were sold 
												but description and Hasnem Co. 
												promptly paid the whole of the 
												purchase price, which S.A.T. Co. 
												accepted. S.A.T. Co. was 
												enjoined to make immediate 
												delivery of all the six chairs 
												to the plaintiff Co. on the same 
												date, place and time.&nbsp; In the 
												present case this was not done 
												and had not been done at the 
												date the writ issued.&nbsp; The law 
												was breached by S.A.T. Co. It 
												also failed to satisfy S. 16 (4) 
												of Act 137 which provides:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;16(4) where the buyer agrees to

												without substituting another 
												date therefore the seller shall 
												do so within reasonable time, 
												having regard in particular to 
												the reasons for which delivery 
												was postponed and the buyer may 
												on reasonable notice to the 
												seller notify him of the latest 
												date on which delivery will be 
												accepted.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The statutory obligation of the

												S.A.T. Co. breached the duty to 
												supply and deliver the 4 
												remaining swivel chairs within 
												reasonable time.&nbsp; I must point 
												out that the parties cannot in 
												law contract outside the express 
												provisions of Act 137.&nbsp; On the 
												evidence before the District 
												Court the S.AT. Co. breached S. 
												16(a) of Act 137.&nbsp; Hasnem Co. in 
												these circumstances could resort 
												to the remedies spelt out at 
												S.49 of Act 137 or in the 
												alternative, refer to and rely 
												on the personal right of a buyer 
												spelt out in Act 137 at SS. 53

												He did not advert to the 
												evidence on record to 
												demonstrate and support this

												before the appellate High Court 
												this ground of appeal was not

												dealt with by that court. I note 
												further that under ground (d) on 
												the notice of appeal an

												effect that &#8220;the judgment cannot

												the law, statute and nature of

												by reproducing these simple and 
												well-known rules.&nbsp; I would 
												nonetheless deal with the 
												submission made on this ground 
												of appeal.&nbsp; The short answer to 
												this ground is that the

												from his own witness, DW1 Mr.

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												About the 15th of August 1997, 
												the plaintiff/respondent bought 
												from, (and made full payment) 
												the Swiss African Trading 
												Company (Beam) a division of UAC 
												Ghana Ltd., six executive chairs 
												made up of two executive and 4 
												secretarial chairs at the cost 
												¢3,400.&nbsp; When after repeated 
												demands the company failed to 
												deliver the four secretarial 
												chairs, the respondents took out 
												a writ of summons against the 
												S.A.T. Company, for an order of 
												specific performance for the 
												supply of the four swivel 
												chairs. The court of first 
												instance, which was the district 
												court, found as a fact (and) as 
												was pleaded by the respondents 
												that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) The parties entered into a 
												valid contract for the supply of 
												the chairs.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) The respondents fully 
												performed their obligation under 
												the contract by providing the 
												necessary consideration in full.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3) The company then substituted 
												by UAC Ghana Ltd., were in 
												breach</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3.&nbsp; The company, then 
												substituted by UAC Ghana Ltd., 
												were in breach by their failure 
												to deliver the goods in 
												accordance with the terms of the 
												contract.&nbsp; The court however, 
												for stated reason, declined to 
												order specific performance, 
												choosing rather to award a 
												monetary compensation by way of 
												general damages for the said 
												breach.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Being clearly dissatisfied with 
												the said decision, the UAC 
												appealed to the High Court on 
												the main ground that the trial 
												court erred in awarding the 
												alternate remedy when the 
												respondents have not claimed 
												that relief. The appellate High 
												Court Judge agreed with them in 
												principle that the order was 
												clearly erroneous.&nbsp; But, 
												concluding that the respondents 
												use the word specific 
												performance semantically she 
												held</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The substance of their claim is 
												that the appellants be made to 
												buy similar chairs at the 
												current price&#8221; She therefore 
												made the following order:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;That the appellants are either 
												to pay to the respondents the 
												current cost of the 4 chairs on 
												or before 15/7/96 or are to go 
												and buy these 4 chairs at the 
												current price or cost of similar 
												make and deliver same to the 
												respondents on or before 
												15/7/96.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is against this order that 
												appellants have further appealed 
												to this court on eight grounds.&nbsp; 
												The relief they are seeking in 
												this court is a total setting 
												aside of the orders or the two 
												courts and a dismissal of the 
												respondents action in its 
												entirety..</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Although eight grounds of appeal 
												were filed, only six were 
												argued.&nbsp; In other words two were 
												abandoned.&nbsp; These are the 
												original ground (b), which 
												raised specifically the question 
												of statute bar and (c), which 
												dealt with the issue of the 
												excessiveness and harshness of 
												the costs.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appeal was therefore fought 
												on original ground (a) and 
												additional grounds 1, 2, 3, and 
												4.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												With respect to the original 
												ground (a) and additional 
												grounds 2, 3, and 4 which were 
												argued together, it was 
												submitted that once the 
												appellate High Court Judge found 
												that the subject matter was not 
												of intrinsic value and 
												consequently that the trial 
												magistrate was right in 
												declining the prayer for the 
												order of specific performance 
												she ought altogether to have 
												dismissed the respondents 
												claim.&nbsp; It was contended that by 
												failing to do so and proceeding 
												to make the findings and drawing 
												those conclusions I have 
												referred, she proprio motuo 
												substituted a case different 
												from and inconsistent with the 
												reliefs claimed by the 
												respondents.&nbsp; The argument 
												therefore is that the orders she 
												made are clearly erroneous and 
												ought not to be allowed to 
												stand.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Very much the same arguments 
												were advanced in support of the 
												additional ground (1) and 
												original ground (d).&nbsp; Again it 
												was submitted that the appellate 
												judge erred in her conclusion 
												that respondent used the words 
												specific performance 
												sequentially&#8221;.&nbsp; It was urged 
												that the substance of the claim 
												was that appellants be ordered 
												to purchase from the open market 
												and deliver to them similar 
												chairs or be made to pay the 
												current cost of the chairs.&nbsp; The 
												contention again was that by so 
												doing the learned judge was by 
												the grant of a relief they never 
												asked for proprio mutu 
												substituting a case different 
												from that which was set up.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Now at the appellants hearing, 
												the learned High Court Judge 
												held as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;I agree with learned counsel 
												for the appellant that the trial 
												magistrate erred in awarding 
												damages to the respondents after 
												he dismissed their only relief 
												for specific performance. As was 
												stated in Dam vs. Addo 1962 2 
												GLR 200 at 203 &#8211; 206, a Supreme 
												Court decision, it is wrong for 
												a court on its own motion to 
												substitute a claim or relief for 
												a party which claim was not 
												asked for&#8221;.&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												She then proceeded to outline 
												the courts duty at the rehearing 
												as follows:-</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;In this instant appeal, the 
												court has to determine whether 
												an award of general damages</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												will adequately compensate the 
												respondents? If not, then should 
												the trial magistrate have 
												decreed specific performance of 
												the contract between the 
												parties?&#8221; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Her answers to these questions 
												was that: &#8220;In view of the fact 
												that similar chairs can be 
												obtained at the open market, 
												albeit at exorbitant and rising 
												cost, these chairs cannot be 
												said to the intrinsic value.&nbsp; 
												Similarly an award of damages 
												will not adequately compensate 
												the respondents.&nbsp; It is the 
												considered view of the court 
												that the respondents used the 
												word specific performance 
												semantically.&nbsp; The substance of 
												their claim is that the 
												appellants are made to go and 
												buy similar chairs at the 
												current price for them or they 
												may be made to pay the current 
												cost of the chairs to them.&nbsp; In 
												effect it is the principle of 
												restituo in intergrum that their 
												claim hinges on.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is these findings and 
												conclusions that have provoked 
												this instant appeal.&nbsp; In my 
												view, the following two basic 
												findings by the learned High 
												Court Judge are without any 
												legal basis.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												1.&nbsp; That an award of damages 
												will not adequately compensate 
												the respondents.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2.&nbsp; The words &#8220;specific 
												performance&#8221; as endorsed on the 
												writ was used indeed it is her 
												views on the semantically and 
												that the substance of their 
												claim is as she has outlined.&nbsp; 
												Substance of the respondents 
												claim that ought properly to 
												attract the criticism that a 
												claim inconsistent with or 
												different from that which was 
												formulated was being 
												substituted.&nbsp; It is plain from 
												both the endorsement and the 
												statement of claim that the 
												respondents were seeking an 
												order for specific performance, 
												pure and simple &#8211; an order 
												directed at the appellants that 
												they deliver these four 
												secretarial swivel chairs which 
												under the contract of sale they 
												agree to supply or deliver.&nbsp; In 
												our jurisdiction, it is a decree 
												they as buyers of goods are 
												entitled to claim.&nbsp; Indeed this 
												right of the buyer to invoke the 
												jurisdiction of the court and 
												apply for this decree that the 
												contract be specifically 
												performed has been statutorily 
												provided for under S. 58 of the 
												Sale of Goods Act, 1962 Act 137, 
												it states.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;In any action for breach of 
												contract to deliver specific or 
												ascertained goods, the court 
												may, if it thinks fit, by its 
												judgment direct that the 
												contract should be specifically 
												performed without giving the 
												seller the option of retaining 
												the goods on payment of 
												damages.&nbsp; The judgment may be 
												unconditional or upon such terms 
												as to damages, costs and other 
												wise as the court may think 
												fit.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												True, it lies entirely within 
												the discretion of the court 
												whether to grant or refuse the 
												decree, but the right to apply 
												for it is open to a buyer of 
												ascertained or specific goods.&nbsp; 
												In my view then, the finding on 
												the substance of the claim is 
												erroneous and the same ought 
												together with the orders flowing 
												therefrom, namely that the 
												&#8220;appellants be made to purchase 
												similar chairs from the open 
												market&#8221; for delivery to the 
												respondents ought to be set 
												aside.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												And now to the critical question 
												raised in this appeal.&nbsp; And it 
												is this: Since both the trial 
												magistrate as well as the 
												appellate High Court Judge found 
												that the decree of specific 
												performance is not the 
												appropriate remedy must the 
												respondents action not be 
												dismissed.&nbsp; Stated differently, 
												will it lie in the power of this 
												court to grant the alternate 
												remedy of damages for.&nbsp; 
												Non-delivery, a relief which was 
												never prayed for by the innocent 
												party?&nbsp; Interestingly, 
												respondent counsel seems to have 
												lost interest in damages and has 
												urged at this rehearing that we 
												do grant the order of specific 
												as the circumstances do justify 
												it.&nbsp; I am afraid I do not think 
												so.&nbsp; He cannot in my view be 
												entitled to an order of specific 
												performance.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Under S.58 of Act 137 specific 
												performance may be decreed only 
												in respect of &#8220;ascertained&#8221; or 
												&#8220;specific goods.&#8221;&nbsp; The statutory 
												definition of ascertained or 
												specific goods is provided for 
												under interpretation section S. 
												81 (1) of Act 137. &#8220;Ascertained 
												goods,&#8221; means goods identified 
												and agreed upon after a contract 
												of sale is made, whilst 
												&#8220;specific goods&#8221; means goods 
												identified and agreed upon at 
												the time a contract of sale is 
												made.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Unfortunately, I do not think 
												the evidence can sustain or 
												justify the finding made by the 
												trial magistrate that the chairs 
												were either &#8220;ascertained&#8221;&nbsp; or 
												&#8220;Specific&#8221; goods within the 
												meaning of the Act. There is no 
												evidence that either at the time 
												of, or after the contract of, 
												sale the parties identified and 
												agreed upon any four particular 
												of specific secretarial swivel 
												chairs that they are the very 
												chairs (and no other) which are 
												to be supplied.&nbsp; On the 
												contrary, it does appear from 
												the evidence that the contract 
												was for the supply for any four 
												ordinary secretarial swivel 
												chairs, presumably from the lot 
												which they manufacture for sale 
												to the general public.&nbsp; Such 
												items would not, in my 
												respectful view qualify as 
												ascertained specific goods and 
												in respect of which under S. 57 
												of Act 137 specific performance 
												may be decreed I also notice 
												that the trial magistrate did 
												conclude that these four swivel 
												chairs are unique and so fall 
												into these class of goods 
												(perhaps under common law, but 
												certainly not under the statute) 
												in respect of which the order 
												may be granted.&nbsp; I do not agree 
												with this finding for there is 
												no evidence to support it.&nbsp; The 
												position then, with respect to 
												these goods is that both at 
												common law and under the statute 
												that is Act 137, specific 
												performance cannot&nbsp; be decreed.</span></p>

												I will therefore deal with the 
												most critical issue raised in 
												this appeal.&nbsp; And it is this: 
												Having come to the conclusion 
												that the remedy sought was 
												inappropriate, does it lie in 
												the power of the court to award 
												damages as the proper judicial 
												relief, when the evidence 
												clearly shows that relief was 
												never claimed.&nbsp; I think the 
												trial magistrate was right in 
												not simply dismissing the 
												respondent case but awarding 
												them damages in the 
												alternative.&nbsp; Indeed in my view, 
												the grant of the relief does not 
												in any way amount to a breach of 
												the rule in Dam vs. Addo 
												(supra). We may for a moment 
												look briefly at that case the 
												facts which led to the 
												formulation of this well known 
												and of used principle of law.&nbsp; 
												The appellant in that case sued 
												the respondents for accounts and 
												also for the sum of&nbsp; £588,185 as 
												due and owing him and arising 
												from a transaction involving 
												guns and ammunitions.&nbsp; Each 
												party, as happens in most civil 
												actions set up a rival claim 
												resulting in the setting down 
												for consideration of a number of 
												serious factual issues.&nbsp; The 
												trial court examined their 
												respective claims and opted for 
												the appellant&#8217;s version. For 
												some strange reason however, 
												judgment was not given for the 
												appellant in whose favour the 
												critical issues were resolved, 
												but for the respondent and based 
												purely on facts which were never 
												pleaded at the trial, and so 
												naturally did not form part of 
												his case, and as was not 
												altogether, in respect of which 
												no evidence was led.&nbsp; It is 
												against the background that the 
												supreme court speaking with one 
												voice through Adumuah Bossman 
												JSC stated the position thus: 
												&#8220;The process of consideration 
												and weighing up of the 
												respective cases of the parties 
												by which the learned judge 
												arrived at the conclusion at 
												which he did arrive, would 
												appear to have involved the 
												substitution by him proprio 
												motuo of a case substantially 
												different from and inconsistent 
												with the case put forward by the 
												respondents and ultimate 
												acceptance by him of that 
												substituted case which was not 
												the respondents case at all.&nbsp; 
												The acceptance in favour of a 
												party of a case different from 
												and inconsistent with that which 
												he himself has put forward in 
												and by his pleadings, has been 
												consistently held to be 
												unjustifiable and fundamentally 
												wrong both by the English 
												superior courts and our local 
												superior courts.&#8221; Of course his 
												Lordships took the opportunity 
												to review both the English and 
												local cases, one of which dates 
												as far back as 1904.&nbsp; They are:</span></p>

												In my view when the trial 
												magistrate granted the alternate 
												relief of damages, he was not 
												proprio motuo substituting a 
												case different from, contrary to 
												or inconsistent with the 
												respondent claim or case.&nbsp; He 
												was not making the same mistake 
												as the trial judge in Adumong 
												vs. Kumah 1989 &#8211; 90 GLR 283.&nbsp; In 
												that case the judge proprio 
												motuo invoked the provisions of 
												the Contract Act in favour of a 
												defendant whose only defence he 
												had set up when sued in his 
												capacity as a guarantor was that 
												he signed the loan agreement not 
												as such guarantor but merely as 
												a witness.&nbsp; It was held, with 
												the judgment of the court being 
												delivered by the President of 
												this court as presently 
												constituted, that (at page 288) 
												&#8220;Since the second defendant did 
												not expressly plead Act 25 in 
												his statement of defence, it was 
												fundamentally wrong for the 
												learned judge to invoke the 
												provisions of that Act to non 
												suit the plaintiff&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What the trial magistrate did in 
												this instant case was to 
												exercise the power inherent in 
												him to give to the respondent 
												that which on the facts they 
												presented at the trial in law 
												they were legally and purely 
												entitled to even though they did 
												not specifically apply for that 
												in the alternative.&nbsp; It would 
												have been a grave miscarriage of 
												justice if the court have non 
												suited with the excuse that he 
												did not endorse his writ for 
												that judicial relief.&nbsp; In any 
												case the magic lies in the 
												endorsement on the writ then my 
												humble view in that to do 
												justice to the parties this 
												court in any case would have 
												power to amend the endorsement 
												to include this alternative 
												relief in order that we 
												determine the real matters in 
												controversy between the parties 
												and so do real justice.&nbsp; A court 
												which acts under the 
												circumstances the trial 
												magistrate did, awarding damages 
												at law, when only the equitable 
												relief of specific performance 
												had been prayed for, would not 
												be acting contrary to Dam vs. 
												Addo (supra) indeed.&nbsp; The sale 
												of Goods Act 137 gives statutory 
												recognition to the remedy open 
												to a buyer of goods in the 3 
												event of non-delivery.&nbsp; The 
												section reads:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;S. 53 where the seller 
												wrongfully neglects or refuses 
												to deliver the goods to the 
												buyer in accordance with the 
												terms of the contract or where 
												the buyer rejects the goods 
												delivered by the seller having 
												the right so to do, the buyer 
												may maintain an action against 
												the seller for damages 
												non-delivery.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In this instant case, therefore 
												when the trial court found, as I 
												do also find, that specific 
												performance is a most 
												inappropriate remedy, his duty, 
												in the face of the overwhelming 
												evidence that the respondent had 
												suffered loss as a result of the 
												non delivery was to grant the 
												most appropriate at the law, and 
												that in my view is damages.&nbsp; On 
												the other order of the appellant 
												High Court Judge that &#8220;he should 
												go to the market and buy similar 
												chairs at the current cost&#8221; 
												rather unknown in law.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Both under the statute and at 
												common law he is entitled to 
												recover damages for the losses

												breach of contract.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												He should be entitled to the

												specific plea for special 
												damages nothing should stop the 
												court from using what ever was 
												not pleaded but nonetheless 
												proved in evidence as evidence 
												special damages in assessing the 
												general damages he is entitled 
												to, for the rule is that in case 
												of non delivery he is entitled 
												also to recover damages for

												necessary by the breach.&nbsp; In 
												this connection, we have
