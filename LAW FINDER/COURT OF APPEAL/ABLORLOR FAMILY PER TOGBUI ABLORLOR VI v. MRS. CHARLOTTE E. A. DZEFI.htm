						BENIN, J.A.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						This appeal raises very interesting customary law 
						questions some of which unfortunately the trial court 
						failed to appreciate. These questions are:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">1) 
						By Ewe customary land law, who are the rightful persons 
						to alienate land owned jointly by two or more distinct 
						families?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">2) 
						What is the effect on any such alienation that is not 
						made by all the appropriate or rightful persons?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">3) 
						Can any one family sue without reference to the other if 
						there is wrongful alienation and recover the land for 
						his family only?</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						Let me recount the facts of this case at this stage. The 
						defendant acquired a piece of land to build on from the 
						Amoah family of Kpando Aloi. When she started building 
						operations on the land, she was challenged by the 
						Ablorlor family (plaintiff&#8217;s family) which claimed 
						ownership of a larger tract of land of which the land in 
						dispute formed a part. The defendant resisted the 
						plaintiff's claim and continued to build, hence the 
						action by the plaintiff before the Hohoe Circuit Court. 
						He claimed these reliefs:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						plaintiff&#8217;s claim and continued to build, hence the 
						action by the plaintiff before the Hohoe Circuit Court. 
						He claimed these reliefs:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						(1) Declaration of title to all that piece or parcel of 
						land at Kpando Aloi commonly known and called Nyametso 
						land.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						(2) General damages for trespass.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						(3) Recovery of possession.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						(4) Perpetual injunction restraining the defendant, her 
						agents and/or servants and all claiming through her from 
						entering the land in dispute or in any way interfering 
						with the same.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In 
						the statement of claim, the plaintiff claimed to be 
						suing for himself as the head of, and for, the Ablorlor 
						Family. He traced the root of his family&#8217;s title to the 
						land which he averred his ancestors acquired by 
						settlement. He averred his family has been exercising 
						rights of ownership over the disputed land, including 
						granting a portion thereof to the Government of Ghana 
						for a housing project.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						The defendant averred that title to the larger tract of 
						land had been determined in litigation in 1962, and 
						pleaded estoppel against the plaintiff. She averred also 
						that she acquired the land lawfully from the Amoah and 
						Ntumy families of Kpando.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">So 
						a key issue that the trial court was called upon to 
						decide was the ownership of the land. Was it owned by 
						the plaintiff&#8217;s family only, or by plaintiff&#8217;s family in 
						conjunction with another family, or by some other family 
						or families to the exclusion of the plaintiff&#8217;s family? 
						Another issue was which family or families gave the land 
						to the defendant? On these issues the trial court made 
						these relevant findings of fact: &#8220;(a) the land belongs 
						to three families (see exhibits 2 and 3) namely, 
						Ablorlor, Kodje and Tengkpo; (b) it was sold to the 
						defendant by one of them.&#8221; These findings are supported 
						by the evidence on record. On the first issue, exhibit 
						3, a judgment of the Kpando Native Tribunal delivered on 
						10 July 1936, is decisive. The relevant parts of that 
						decision read: &#8220;This Tribunal&#8230;finds out that the three 
						families of Aloi, namely, Kodje, Ablorlor and Komla Teng 
						have joint title to ownership of the said land in 
						dispute. Plaintiff is of Ablorlor and defendant of Teng 
						Kpo&#8230; The Tribunal&#8230;ruled that either party in the case as 
						well as every individual from the three families can 
						enjoy the said land. Title or ownership to the said land 
						is vested neither in plaintiff nor defendant but 
						everybody in the three respective families to enjoy the 
						said land in dispute&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						Then on the second issue even though the plaintiff said 
						she also went to one Sebastian Tende Ablorlor, a member 
						of the plaintiff&#8217;s family to cement the grant previously 
						made to him by the Amoah family, it appears this man was 
						not a true representative of the Ablorlor family. Thus 
						only the Amoah family gave away this land to the 
						defendant. However, only the plaintiff&#8217;s family 
						complained about the grant to the defendant. Hence the 
						obvious questions that the trial court ought to have 
						resolved were the three that I posed in the opening 
						paragraph of this judgment. The 1936 judgment declared 
						the right of members of the three families to enjoy the 
						land. But it did not determine who has the right of 
						alienation of portion of the land to strangers.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						After those two relevant findings of fact about 
						ownership of the land and the acquisition by the 
						defendant, the trial court set out what it regarded to 
						be two issues for its consideration. The court said: 
						&#8220;The first is who can validly alienate family land and 
						the second is who can redeem or save family land or 
						property from being lost?&quot; Obviously the second issue 
						the trial court set out did not arise at all on the 
						pleadings, as I shall shortly explain. On the first 
						issue the trial court rightly set out the law that the 
						heads and principal members are the rightful persons to 
						give away family land. The court concluded that &#8220;since 
						the land belongs to three families...only the three 
						heads and their principal members can validly alienate 
						the land&#8230;..therefore the grant by one family is not 
						valid as against the other two families and is of no 
						effect.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						Returning to the second issue, the court relied on the 
						exceptions in the case of KWAN VS. NYIENI (1959) G.L.R. 
						67 and held that the plaintiff could sue to protect 
						family property that was in danger of being lost to the 
						family. For that reason the court held that the 
						plaintiff had capacity to bring this action. The court 
						said the defendant's grantor had also failed to join her 
						in this litigation. It accordingly entered judgment for 
						the plaintiff granting him these reliefs:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						&#8220;(a) a declaration that the land the subject-matter of 
						the suit is the property of the plaintiff&#8217;s family.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						(b) a declaration that the purported sale of the land by 
						Amoah family and Sebastian Tende Ablorlor is void ab 
						initio;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						(c) recovery of possession;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						(d) perpetual injunction&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">By 
						customary law any disposition of family land made 
						without the consent and concurrence of the head is 
						absolutely void ab initio. So where, as in this case, 
						there are two or more distinct families, the head of 
						each of these families must be a consenting party in any 
						alienation of family land to a stranger. An alienation 
						by one or two heads without prior reference to the third 
						will be void, unless he concurs in the grant, either 
						expressly or by conduct, through silence or inaction 
						after he has become aware of it. The position is akin to 
						the situation whereby a family that has two joint heads 
						cannot make a valid alienation of family land by only 
						one head. But if there is evidence that the three 
						families have a common overall head then it is this 
						head, as against the heads of the various families who 
						has the right to alienate family land with the consent 
						and concurrence of the other individual heads of family. 
						Where the majority agree to alienate, the minority 
						should not unreasonably withhold consent. Consensus 
						building is always a key factor in family decisions, 
						hence the need for all concerned to be consulted.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">As 
						said earlier only the plaintiff&#8217;s family is moving 
						against the grant made by only the Amoah family to the 
						defendant. If the plaintiffs claim is to seek an order 
						setting aside the said grant as invalid, it will be 
						perfectly in order since he, as a consenting party, was 
						not consulted before the alienation. But he does not 
						seek this relief, hence the trial court erred in 
						formulating and granting a declaration that the 
						purported alienation of the land to the defendant is 
						void. The court cannot grant any relief that the party 
						himself has not asked for, without amending the 
						endorsement on the writ, if appropriate to do so.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						Also the application of the KWAN VS. NYIENI principle 
						was wrong in the sense that the plaintiff did not come 
						to court claiming that joint family property was in 
						danger of being lost and that the other family heads 
						were refusing to take action to protect it. Neither is 
						he saying the other family heads had refused to join him 
						in this action. His claim was simply that his Ablorlor 
						family exclusively owned this land. A plaintiff who 
						seeks declaration of title must succeed on the strength 
						of his own case, not on the weakness of the defence. So 
						that when the trial court found that the plaintiff&#8217;s 
						claim to exclusive ownership was not established on the 
						evidence, it ought to have dismissed the claim outright.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						The trial court decided to investigate the plaintiff&#8217;s 
						capacity to bring this action, which was a triable issue 
						raised on the pleadings. In this connection, it ought to 
						have found out whether the plaintiff was representing 
						all the three families. It could reasonably be said that 
						the Amoah family, which gave the land to the defendant, 
						would not join in any such action. Yet the other family, 
						Kodje, ought to have been consulted. It is clear from 
						the record that this family was not consulted. This is 
						because its head was compelled to apply to join the suit 
						as a co-defendant in order to protect his family's 
						interest in the property, which application was, 
						however, rejected by the trial court. If that family had 
						been consulted by the plaintiff and it had declined to 
						join him, then he alone could sue under the exceptions 
						to the KWAN V. NYIENI principle. These were stated, per 
						Van Lare, Ag. CJ. who read the judgment of the court, at 
						pages 72-73 of the report in these words:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						&#8220;(1) as a general rule the head of a family, as 
						representative of the family, is the proper person to 
						institute suits for the recovery of family land;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						(1) to this general rule there are exceptions in certain 
						circumstances, such as:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						i)&nbsp; where the family property is in danger of being lost 
						to the family, and it is shown that that the head 
						(either out of personal interest, or otherwise) will not 
						make a move to save or preserve it; or</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						(i) where, owing to a division in the family, the head 
						and some of the principal members will not take any 
						step; or</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						(ii) where the head and the principal members are 
						deliberately disposing of the family property in their 
						personal interest, to the detriment of the family as a 
						whole.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It 
						is to be noted that the court in KWAN V. NYIENI was 
						careful in not granting an unbridled right to any person 
						who felt aggrieved to go to court. It made it clear that 
						anybody who went to court in any of the circumstances 
						described above could only do so to protect family 
						property, that is property that belongs to the entire 
						family. At page 73 of the report, the court made it 
						clear that in any of the circumstances described as 
						exceptions to the general rule, &#8220;the court will 
						entertain an action by any member of the family, either 
						upon proof that he has been authorised by other members 
						of the family to sue, or upon proof of necessity, 
						provided that the Court is satisfied that the action is 
						instituted in order to preserve the family character of 
						the property.&#8221; (The emphasis is mine.)</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In 
						this case, it became clear the plaintiff had not even 
						sought the consent of the other family, Kodje, before 
						bringing this action. Nor was there evidence that Kodje 
						family was not interested in protecting the family 
						property; at least their attempt to join the action 
						confirms they were interested. It also became clear, 
						from the trial court's own finding of fact, that the 
						plaintiff did not sue to protect the family character of 
						the property. He did not even acknowledge the fact that 
						the property was jointly owned, so he could not be said 
						to have sued to protect the family character of same. 
						The trial court therefore erred in holding that he had 
						capacity to bring this action, since none of the 
						circumstances described in KWAN V. NYIENI availed him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						Reliefs 2, 3 and 4 endorsed on the writ are all 
						ancillary to the main one which is relief 1. So the 
						court, having found plaintiff&#8217;s family did not solely 
						own this land, could not substitute anything for that 
						relief by saying it was jointly owned, and then go on to 
						grant the ancillary reliefs. A court could not &#8216;proprio 
						motu&#8217; grant reliefs to a party which he did not ask for. 
						If on the evidence he is unable to prove the reliefs he 
						seeks by his writ, his claim ought to fail, since the 
						reliefs introduce the cause of action. The pleadings 
						merely state material facts in support of the reliefs. 
						An exception is where, in a claim for money, a plaintiff 
						is found to be entitled to more money than is endorsed 
						on the writ. In that case the court is allowed by Order 
						28, r.12 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 
						(L.N. 140A) to amend the reliefs to include a claim for 
						the larger amount, so long as that larger amount was 
						within the civil jurisdiction of the trial court. See 
						AMAKOM SAWMILL &amp; CO. V. MANSAH (1963) 1 G.L.R. 368 S.C. 
						In short, it is wrong for a court to base its judgment 
						&#8220;on a point that was not a triable issue on the 
						pleadings,&#8221; per Crabbe, J.S.C. in MALM V. LUTTERODT 
						(1963) 1 G.L.R.1 S.C. at p.15. The pleadings did not 
						disclose that the plaintiff was suing because the land 
						was owned by the three families and wanted to protect 
						its communal character. He sued for his family as the 
						sole owner thereof, hence the first two issues agreed 
						upon for trial, namely:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						(a) Whether or not the land in dispute as described by 
						the plaintiff was founded by Togbui Ablorlor I and 
						belongs to the Ablorlor Family.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						(b) Whether or not the Ablorlor family has been 
						exercising rights of ownership over the land in dispute.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						And having failed to prove these issues, the trial court 
						erred in substituting them with issues he considered the 
						plaintiff was entitled to in the light of the defence, 
						unmindful of the fact that plaintiff had to succeed on 
						the strength of his own case. A trial court, and for 
						that matter an appellate court, ought not to accept in 
						favour of a party a case different from, and 
						inconsistent with, that which the party himself had put 
						forward in his pleadings, see TAWIAH-YESEREH V. C.F.A.O. 
						and Another (1966) G.L.R. 357 S.C. For these reasons the 
						first three grounds of the original grounds of appeal 
						are allowed. These grounds are:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">a) 
						That the trial Judge erred in law by giving judgment to 
						the plaintiff/respondent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">b) 
						That the learned trial Judge did not appreciate the 
						issue of capacity and thus erred in declaring title in 
						the plaintiff/respondent.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">c) 
						That the judgment cannot be supported having regard to 
						the evidence on record.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						Now to the additional grounds of appeal. The first two 
						relate to an application allowed by the trial court to 
						the plaintiff to amend the statement of claim. These are 
						the circumstances of that amendment. The plaintiff 
						opened his case and in the course of his 
						evidence-in-chief, his Counsel applied orally to amend 
						paragraph 4 of the statement of claim to add six words 
						which he claimed had been left out inadvertently by the 
						typist. This oral application was opposed by Counsel for 
						the defendant on the ground that the amendment would 
						change the entire nature of the case put up by the 
						plaintiff. Counsel therefore argued that there was the 
						need for a motion supported by affidavit to explain this 
						substantial and late amendment. The trial court allowed 
						the amendment nonetheless. The defendant is saying that 
						the amendment was wrongly allowed on an oral application 
						and that it has caused substantial miscarriage of 
						justice to her.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						The question then is whether every application to the 
						court should be in writing, or whether an oral 
						application will suffice. In the case of KUSI V. SHELL 
						COMPANY OF GHANA LTD. (1973) 1 G.L.R. 173, this court 
						considered this question and said, per Amissah, J.A. at 
						p. 174, that &#8220;where a law requires that a party should 
						apply to the court, without stating the form it should 
						take, the application need not be in writing. An oral 
						application will suffice where no prejudice is suffered 
						by the opponent from the nature of the application.&#8221; 
						From this dictum the court has to find out whether there 
						is no requirement for writing in the particular 
						legislation under which the application was made; or 
						there is any applicable legislation in force. The 
						starting point for our consideration, therefore, is 
						whether an application to amend pleadings could be done 
						orally. The particular application was governed by Order 
						28, r.6 of L.N.140A. It provides: &#8216;In all cases not 
						provided for by the preceding Rules of this Order, 
						application for leave to amend may be made by either 
						party to the Court or a Judge, or to the Judge at the 
						trial of the action, and such amendment may be allowed 
						upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as may be 
						just.&#8217;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						This rule requires an application for leave to be made 
						to the Court or Judge. Does this imply writing? We may 
						have to turn to Order 52, r. 1 of L.N. 140A for an 
						answer. It provides: &#8216;Where by these rules any 
						application is authorised to be made to the Court or a 
						Judge, such application if made to a Judge in court, 
						shall be made by motion.&#8217;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						This is a general provision that applies to all cases in 
						which an application may be made to the Court, (open 
						court as opposed to application to be heard in 
						chambers), or Judge (as opposed to Master). It says in 
						no uncertain language that it shall be made by motion, 
						that requires writing.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						Reading Order 28, r.6 alongside Order 52, r.1, it is my 
						view that an application to a court or Judge for leave 
						to amend shall be in writing, by motion. The provision 
						contained in Order 52, r. 1 has been held by this court 
						to be mandatory. This was in the case of MICHELLETTI 
						POLLA LTD. V. CRABBE and Others, (1976) 1 G.L.R. 108. 
						That case dealt with an oral application for judgment 
						made under Order 32, r.6, and the court held that the 
						trial court had no competence or jurisdiction if the 
						application was made in open court to waive that 
						provision especially in the teeth of strenuous 
						opposition. That decision is equally applicable to Order 
						28, r.6 especially when the defendant herein, per 
						counsel, had opposed the application and insisted that 
						it be made on notice to her. I hold that the leave 
						granted to amend upon the oral application was wrong. 
						The order granting the said leave is hereby set aside.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">On 
						a more serious point, additional ground 2 charges that 
						even if the leave granted was right, yet the order 
						lapsed since no amended statement of claim was filed, as 
						required by Order 28, r.7 of L.N. 140A. This rule 
						states: &#8216;If a party who has obtained an order for leave 
						to amend does not amend accordingly within the time 
						limited for that purpose by the order, or if no time is 
						thereby limited then within fourteen days from the date 
						of the order, such order to amend shall, on the 
						expiration of such limited time as aforesaid, or of such 
						fourteen days, as the case may be, become ipso facto 
						void, unless the time is extended by the Court or a 
						Judge.&#8217;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">It 
						has been decided by this court in the case of MAHAMA 
						HAUSA and Others V. BAAKO HAUSA and Another (1972) 2 
						G.L.R. 469 holding 3, that if a court in granting leave 
						for amendment confines itself to leave to amend (as in 
						the instant case), the failure to file the amendments 
						within the time limited must result in their becoming 
						ipso facto void, as laid down in Order 28, r.7. It 
						follows, and I hold, that the leave to amend granted the 
						plaintiff, even if valid, lapsed after fourteen days; so 
						the position is as though no leave to amend was ever 
						granted. This ground of appeal thus succeeds.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">
						Finally, additional ground 3 and it reads: The learned 
						trial Judge erred in entering judgment for declaration 
						of title in favour of the plaintiff when the question of 
						his boundaries were not clearly identified and known.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I 
						think I need not waste time on this ground of appeal. 
						Suffice it to say that it has been firmly established 
						that the entire area of land is owned by the three 
						families. Thus any decision granting title to only the 
						plaintiff&#8217;s family, on whatever facts, is clearly in 
						error. This ground accordingly succeeds.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In 
						the result, the appeal is allowed. The judgment of the 
						court below will be set aside as well as any order made 
						pursuant to the said judgment.</span></p>
