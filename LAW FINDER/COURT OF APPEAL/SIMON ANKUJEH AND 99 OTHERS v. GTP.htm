												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												BROBBEY, J.A. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The applicants herein have 
												instituted an action against the 
												respondent company claiming 
												certain reliefs relating to 
												their end of service benefits. 
												The case was tried in the High 
												Court and judgment given in 
												favour of the applicants. The 
												respondents appealed to this 
												court. The appeal was heard to 
												conclusion and is awaiting 
												judgment.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The applicants then filed the 
												instant application for leave to 
												adduce fresh evidence. The 
												evidence which is sought to be 
												adduced is to the effect that 
												junior and senior staff members 
												were employed on different 
												conditions of service. The 
												application was brought under 
												CI.20, rules 26 and 31. The 
												first rule provides that;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;26. (1) It is not open as of 
												right to any party to an appeal 
												to adduce new evidence in 
												support of his original case 
												but, in the interest of justice, 
												the court may allow or require 
												new evidence to be adduced; such 
												evidence shall be in the form of 
												oral examination in court, an 
												affidavit or a deposition taken 
												before an examiner or 
												commissioner as the court may 
												direct.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) A party may, by leave of the 
												court, allege any facts 
												essential to the issue that has 
												come to his knowledge after the 
												decision of the court below and 
												adduced evidence in support of 
												the allegation.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is the rule as contained in 
												the Court of Appeal Rules, 1997 
												(CI 19) (not CI 20 as stated in 
												the motion paper). It is a 
												re-enactment of the original 
												rule in the Court of Appeal 
												Rules, LI 218 and in fact the 
												wordings of the two are the 
												same. The only difference is 
												that the original rule has now 
												been split into two i.e. 26(1) 
												and 26(2).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The rules have been the subject 
												matter of various decisions, one 
												of which counsel for the 
												applicants has relied upon and 
												supplied us with photocopy. That 
												was Sasu vrs. Amua-Sekyi 
												[1987-88] 1 GLR.294, SC.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There is no doubt that this 
												court has the power to allow 
												fresh evidence to be adduced in 
												appropriate cases. The facts 
												leading to this application 
												however present a peculiar 
												problem. Thoughout the trial 
												court and in this court, the 
												applicants took the position 
												that both senior and junior 
												staff members were on the same 
												conditions of service. That was 
												confirmed by the PW1 in his 
												testimony at the trial court. 
												When the PW2 testified, he too 
												was emphatic that junior and 
												senior staff members were on the 
												same conditions of service. As 
												stated already, the evidence now 
												being sought to be adduced is to 
												the effect that junior and 
												senior staff members were on 
												different conditions of service. 
												The question which arises here 
												is whether or not, in the 
												appellate court, fresh evidence 
												may be led to contradict the 
												evidence already given and also 
												to set up an entirely different 
												case from that already adduced 
												at the trial court. The case of 
												Sasu vrs. Amua-Sekyi supra 
												provides an appropriate answer. 
												At page 295 of the report, it is 
												stated that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;After all a person who appeals 
												from a decision of a trial court 
												is impliedly saying that the 
												decision of that court is wrong 
												having regard to the evidence 
												put before that court. The duty 
												of the appellate court is 
												therefore to look at that 
												evidence to determine whether 
												the appellant&#8217;s complaint is 
												justified or not. If the 
												appellate court bases its 
												decision on evidence that was 
												not before the trial court, then 
												it is not sitting as an appeal 
												court, if only because it is not 
												reconsidering the &#8220;appealed&#8221; 
												evidence; it is rather looking 
												at new, fresh evidence and 
												therefore sitting as a court of 
												first instance; it is sitting as 
												a trial court. In those 
												circumstances, the decision 
												&#8220;appeal allowed&#8221; ceases to have 
												any meaning, for the appellate 
												judges cannot say that the trial 
												court was wrong, when they know 
												the evidence they used to arrive 
												at that pronouncement was not 
												available to the trial judge, 
												and therefore he was not in a 
												position to make a right or 
												wrong decision thereon.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is clear from this authority 
												that the applicants cannot 
												seriously contend while the case 
												is on appeal here that their 
												case should now be considered on 
												the basis that senior and junior 
												staff members no longer had the 
												same conditions of service when 
												they contested the trial at the 
												trial court on the basis that 
												they all had the same conditions 
												of service.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel for the applicant 
												intimated to the court that the 
												applicants would amend their 
												case. In the first place, the 
												amendment has not yet been 
												effected and so it cannot be 
												taken into account. To do that 
												would amount to indulging in 
												speculation. In the second 
												place, what makes counsel to 
												believe that his amendment would 
												be granted or refused? He cannot 
												be sure of the amendment.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the third place, in the event 
												of the amendment being refused, 
												what would happen would be that 
												there would be two conflicting 
												and contradictory evidence 
												standing on the record in 
												support of the case of the 
												applicants: one would support 
												the standpoint that senior and 
												junior staff members were on the 
												same conditions of service; the 
												other would support the 
												standpoint that the senior and 
												junior staff members were on 
												different conditions of service. 
												What really would be the case 
												which the applicants would want 
												the court to consider?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A significant point which 
												undermines the application of 
												the applicants is the fact that 
												the real bone of contention in 
												the appeal is whether or not on 
												a true interpretation of NLCD 
												157, ss.34 and 35 and NLCD 342, 
												the severance benefits of the 
												applicants should be calculated 
												from the day when each started 
												working with the respondent 
												company or from the period prior 
												to 1st January, 1991. The issue 
												pending before this court is one 
												of interpretation. Adducing 
												fresh evidence relating to 
												differences between the service 
												conditions of senior and junior 
												staff members will not in any 
												way assist in the interpretation 
												of these provisions. That 
												evidence may perhaps help the 
												applicants to earn more 
												severance pay. But that will be 
												leading fresh evidence to 
												increase the quantum of their 
												severance award in a manner not 
												canvassed before the trial judge 
												for him to have decided one way 
												or the other on that issue. The 
												motion paper also referred to 
												rule 31 as one of the rules on 
												which the motion was brought. 
												That rule covers the general 
												powers of this court. It cannot 
												provide a basis for bringing the 
												motion where the evidence sought 
												to be adduced is contradictory 
												to the evidence which was laid 
												before the trial court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												For these reasons, the 
												application fails and should be 
												dismissed.</span></p>

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The main rule under which the 
												application is brought is 
												self-explanatory. Fresh evidence 
												can be adduced only in support 
												of an original case. It follows 
												where the fresh evidence is 
												intended to lead to a departure 
												from the original case. The 
												application ought to fail. Also, 
												if the fresh evidence would be 
												inconsistent with or at variance 
												with the original action. It is 
												for this reason that like my 
												brother, I also agree that 
												application be dismissed as to 
												allow this would alter the 
												nature and direction of the case 
												they presented in the Court 
												below.</span></p>
