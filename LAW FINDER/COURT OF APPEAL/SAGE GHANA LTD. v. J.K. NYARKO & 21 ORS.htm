						<span style="font-family: Arial">J.B. AKAMBA, J.A</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On 15th November 2002, 
						Mrs. I.M. Heward-Mills, J. sitting at the High Court 
						Tema, entered judgment against the defendant/appellant 
						(hereinafter referred as the defendant) upon a writ of 
						summons laid before her. The defendant, who is 
						dissatisfied with the judgment, filed the present appeal 
						in this court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The facts of this case 
						as gleaned from the record of proceedings are that the 
						defendant company employed the twenty-two 
						plaintiffs/respondents (hereinafter simply referred as 
						the plaintiffs) as non-permanent (casual) labourers on 
						various dates before their appointments were terminated 
						on 29th February 2000. The plaintiffs' employment was 
						covered by collective agreement, which spelt out their 
						conditions of service. The collective agreement, exhibit 
						A, is governed by the Industrial Relations Act 1965, Act 
						229, since it was negotiated on their behalf by the 
						Trade Union. It is the case of the plaintiffs that upon 
						the termination of their employment, the defendant 
						failed to pay them duly as provided under the agreement 
						resulting in loss to each plaintiff. The plaintiffs also 
						contend that prior to tile termination of their 
						respective employments, tile defendant had failed to 
						convert their casual status to permanent, in accordance 
						with the collective agreement despite the fact that they 
						had qualified for such conversion. This was also done to 
						their detriment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendant on the 
						other hand, admits that even though there were no formal 
						notifications to the plaintiffs either individually or 
						collectively, defendants appropriate had treated the 
						plaintiffs as permanent employees. They accordingly paid 
						the plaintiffs appropriate benefits except for those 
						benefits that required individual formal applications. 
						In these latter instances those who applied were granted 
						the facility.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiffs issued 
						their writ of summons on 28th April 2000 claiming 
						against the defendant the following:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(1) Damages for breach 
						of contract in failing to engage PLAINTIFFS in the 
						permanent establishment of DEFENDANT company according 
						to their employment contract resulting in monetary loss 
						to PLAINTIFFS.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) Payment of 
						differences between payment made upon PLAINTIFFS 
						redundancy and PLAINTIFFS&#8217; rightful entitlements as 
						would be entitled to a permanent employee.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(3) Special damages.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial judge after 
						hearing evidence from both parties entered judgment for 
						the plaintiffs granting all the reliefs stated supra. 
						The defendant who is aggrieved by the decision filed the 
						following grounds of appeal.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(1) The judgment is 
						against the weight of evidence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) The trial judge 
						erred in law and in fact in awarding general damages and 
						interest and worse still excessive general damages and 
						interest in favour of plaintiffs.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(3) The trial judge 
						erred in law and in fact in awarding extremely excessive 
						cost to the plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(4) The trial judge 
						erred in law and intact by failing to apply the 
						Limitation Decree, 1972 (NRCD 54) in favour of the 
						Defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(5) The trial judge 
						erred in Law and in fact by failing to apply the common 
						law principle of estoppel in favour of the defendant but 
						applied it in favour of the plaintiffs.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(6) Further grounds to 
						be filed upon receipt of the record of proceedings.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I propose to dispose of 
						this appeal in the same sequence adopted by the 
						appellant counsel in his submission of case, starting 
						with grounds one (1) and two (2) together. The complaint 
						in these two grounds together is that the judgment is 
						against the weight of evidence in the award of excessive 
						general damages and interest in favour of the 
						plaintiffs.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Before dealing with the 
						ground of appeal (supra), let me quickly determine the 
						preliminary point raised by the plaintiffs in their 
						answer to the submissions of the appellant, alleging 
						that the statement of case was filed out of time thereby 
						infringing rule 20(1) of CI 19 as amended by C.I. 25. 
						The plaintiff's counsel attached a search&#8212;exhibit A&#8212;made 
						at the registry of this court to prove that civil form 6 
						was served on the defendant on 14th January 2004 but as 
						at 1st April 2004, the defendant had not filed his 
						written submission. The defendant however filed the 
						statement of case on 11th March 2004, twenty-six days 
						after the time limited for filling. Under rule 20 (1) of 
						C.1 19, as amended by CI 25, an appellant, shall within 
						21 days of being notified in form 6 that the record is 
						ready, or within such time as the court may upon terms 
						direct, file his written submission of case with the 
						registrar. There is also no indication that leave of 
						court was sought and obtained.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In response, the 
						defendant submitted that his written submission was 
						filed within 21 days, calculating from 25th February 
						2004 when they found the civil form 6 abandoned on their 
						table. According to the defendants' counsel, the bailiff 
						did not serve form 6 on him. The defendant company was 
						also not served, and could not have been served since 
						the company ceased operating on 30th May 2003 and all 
						the employees and officers made redundant. The company's 
						offices have since 1st June 2003 remained unoccupied. 
						The defendants for their part, also attached the results 
						of a search undertaken in the registry of this court, to 
						prove that the form 6 was served on one Mr. Ohene Asante 
						whose designation or post was not indicated. There is no 
						person by the name Ohene Asante in the employment of 
						defendant. This kind of service is improper and could 
						not be relied upon to determine the fate of the 
						statement of case filed. There was also no indication as 
						to who signed on behalf of the defendant as having 
						received the form 6.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There are sufficient 
						lapses in the service and the certificate of service to 
						render it unreliable. I am left with no choice than 
						accept that the defendants indeed found form 6 abandoned 
						on a table in their office on 25th February 2004. 
						Reckoning that the defendant found the form 6 on 25th 
						February 2004 and they filed their statement of case on 
						11th March 2004, they were within the stipulated time 
						provided by the rules. In the result I find no merit 
						whatsoever in the preliminary objection and dismiss it.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendant impugns 
						the trial judges finding that all the twenty-two 
						plaintiffs have been in employment for more than ten 
						years for which they were entitled to the benefits 
						equally. Counsel refers to exhibit 4 from pages 110 to 
						130 of the record as indicative of the respective dates 
						of appointment of each plaintiff. Exhibit 3 and 4 are 
						pay slips in&nbsp; respect of each of the plaintiffs, 
						tendered in evidence by the defendant. Whilst it is true 
						that the date of appointment of each plaintiff is 
						clearly written on the pay slip relevant to him, I find 
						two different dates of appointment given in respect of 
						the same persons on the two exhibits. This discrepancy 
						notwithstanding, it is still possible to determine those 
						who have worked for ten years and above or below 
						because, by and large, the difference relates to the 
						months in which they were appointed. It is certainly 
						important to know the dates of appointment in order that 
						injustices will not be done to any party on account of a 
						wrong date. A close look at both exhibits 3 and 4 
						reveals that only eight of the plaintiffs had worked for 
						ten years and above at the time of the determination. 
						These are the 1st plaintiff&nbsp; J. K. Nyarko, 2nd plaintiff 
						Joseph Dari Fulo, the 3rd plaintiff John Kofie, the 6th 
						plaintiff Dayiriga Lobi, the plaintiff Kwame Oduro, the 
						11th plaintiff Bribe Sey, the 14th plaintiff Yakubu 
						Kusasi and the 17th plaintiff S.K. Ampomah.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Article 4 (vi) of the 
						collective agreement, exhibit A, provides that any non 
						permanent employee who has been working satisfactorily 
						on a casual or regular basis for a period of 132 working 
						days or 1056 hours, whichever is less, shall be 
						confirmed in the permanent establishment of the company. 
						There is no evidence that the defendant ever wrote 
						confirming any of the eight aforementioned plaintiffs, 
						during their ten years of employment, in any permanent 
						establishment of the company. However by virtue of 
						Article 4 (iii) of exhibit A, the said plaintiffs should 
						be deemed confirmed in permanent establishment. The 
						failure to specifically confirm the aforesaid plaintiffs 
						in permanent status worked to the detriment of the said 
						plaintiffs since there was nothing such as enhanced take 
						home pay and benefits to show but the mere presumption. 
						It is not true to suggest that the salaries of both 
						permanent and non-permanent employees are the same or 
						remained the same over the years. Had they been put on 
						salaries commensurate with confirmation some would have 
						progressed along the salary scale to appropriate 
						heights.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendant next 
						questions the fifteen (15) million cedis damages made in 
						favour of each of the plaintiffs thus totaling three 
						hundred and thirty million (330 million) cedis. His 
						complaint about fourteen of the plaintiffs in particular 
						is that they had been engaged for periods far shorter 
						than ten years to warrant that collosal award. Since 
						this ground raises questions about the damages awarded 
						in favour of all the plaintiffs, the award would be 
						scrutinized to ascertain whether it conformed to the 
						rules. Damages are awarded as financial compensation for 
						actual loss provided it is not too remote. They are not 
						intended to punish the defendant either. The case of 
						Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Exch. 342 @ 354 which blazed 
						the trail for the award of damages states that damage is 
						too remote if the damage is not the natural consequence 
						of the breach. Also, it is too remote where the 
						defendant could not have foreseen it (the damage) when 
						making the contract. In the words of Alderson B in the 
						Hadley v Baxendale case (supra): &quot;Where two parties have 
						made a contract which one of them has broken, the 
						damages which the other party ought to receive in 
						respect of such breach of contract should be such as may 
						fairly and reasonably be considered either arising 
						naturally i.e. according to the usual course of things, 
						front such breach of contract itself or such as may 
						reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation 
						of both parties, at the time they made the contract, as 
						the probable result of the breach of it.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the light of the 
						evidence on record and the authorities cited, the 
						defendants are justified in decrying the award of 
						fifteen million cedis damages across board for all the 
						twenty two plaintiffs for the simple reason that it is 
						unreasonable in some instances whilst for some it might 
						be acceptable. It is unjustifiable and unacceptable to 
						treat the entire plaintiffs equally for the purposes of 
						imposing damages whereas they were appointed on 
						different dates and served different tenures. The 
						defendants claim that the plaintiffs had enjoyed 
						benefits ordinarily accorded permanent employees but 
						this does not discharge them from the consequences of 
						their failure to officially write to declare them 
						(plaintiffs) as permanent workers with permanent salary 
						structures and benefits. The plaintiffs are certainly 
						entitled to damages but these should be commensurate 
						with their years of&nbsp; employment with the defendant and 
						bearing in mind the treatment generally accorded them by 
						the defendant. Accordingly I hereby set aside the 
						fifteen million cedis awarded in favour of each of the 
						plaintiffs. I enter the following damages in respect of 
						the plaintiffs, namely: fourteen (14) million cedis for 
						those who worked for ten (10) years and above; ten (10) 
						million cedis for those who worked for five (5) years 
						and above but less than ten (10) years; five (5) million 
						cedis for those who worked for one (1) year and above 
						but less than five years, and two (2) million cedis for

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The defendant has also 
						raised for determination that the plaintiffs action in 
						the court below was statute barred relying upon the 
						Limitations Decree NRCD 54. Whilst it does appear that 
						the cause of action for some of the plaintiffs was 
						extinguished at the time they instituted their action, 
						the defendant could not wait till the close of evidence 
						to pull a surprise at plaintiffs. A statute of 
						limitation seeks to regulate the time within which a 
						party's rights would be invoked within the law. The 
						essence of limitations is to set a time limit within 
						which to articulate a person's right of action in order 
						that litigation will be minimized or brought within 
						limits. This being the case, limitations operate within 
						rules, one of which is the requirement for pleading. 
						Pleading will ensure that the other party is adequately 
						informed to enable him prepare to answer. The defendant 
						had urged that NRCD 54 being a statute and a decree as 
						such, pleading is no longer necessary in order to invoke 
						its provisions. This to my mind is at best a self 
						serving argument and not backed by any authority. The 
						decree did not do away with the rule of practice, which 
						requires that the other party be alerted in the event 
						that limitation will be made an issue.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Limitation being an 
						issue of law, the defendant is required under Order 19, 
						r 16 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954 (LN 
						140A) to specifically plead it in order to obviate any 
						surprises to the plaintiffs. Order 19, r 16 enacts: &quot; 
						16. The defendant or plaintiff (as the case may be) must 
						raise by his pleading all matters which show the action 
						or counterclaim not to be maintainable, or that the 
						transaction is either void or voidable in&nbsp; point of law, 
						and all such grounds of defence or reply, as the case 
						may be, as if not raise would be likely to take the 
						opposite party by surprise, or would raise issues of 
						fact not arising out of the preceding pleadings, as, for 
						instance, fraud, statute of Limitations, release, 
						payment, performance, facts showing illegality either by 
						statute or common law, or Statute of Frauds.&quot; 
						(Underlined for emphasis). I also find support for my 
						view in the case of Dolphyne (No 3) v Speedline 
						Stevedoring Co. Ltd. and Anor (1996-97) SCGLR 514, of 
						which I am bound. In any case, the defendant has not 
						given me any good reason not to follow the authority 
						cited supra. In the above-cited case, Charles Hayfron 
						Benjamin, JSC put the issue beyond doubt when he said on 
						page 521 thus:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Suffice it to say that 
						that Limitation Decree, 1972 (NRCD 54) adverted to is 
						essentially a special plea and must be pleaded: see 
						Order 19, r 15 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) 
						Rules, 1984 (LN 140A). It must he borne in mind that if 
						this special plea is not pleaded, it cannot be adverted 
						to in submissions to the court. The court on its part 
						will not also of its own motion take notice that the 
						action is out of time.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the result, it is my 
						finding that the defendant has not demonstrated that he 
						is entitled to this relief having simply failed to plead 
						the issue of limitation in the court below. This ground 
						of appeal accordingly fails.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">There now remains the 
						issue of costs, which the defendant decries as being 
						fantastic and excessive. In her judgment the trial judge 
						dealt with the issue of cost at the close of her 
						determination of damages. This is what she said: &quot; 
						However in recognition of the loss to the plaintiffs 
						resulting from the defendants breach of their statutory 
						obligations under the governing collective agreement, 
						the court awarded general damages of 15 million cedis 
						together with interest at prevailing bank rate from June 
						2000 to date, to each of the plaintiffs. Cost of five 
						(5) million cedis is also awarded to each of the 
						plaintiffs.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is trite to observe 
						that a successful party is usually entitled to costs but 
						this is a matter of discretion for the trail judge who 
						is required to exercise his/her discretion judicially, 
						that is to say, according to reason and justice and not 
						according to sentiments or sensibility. A party who is 
						aggrieved by an award of costs may upset it if he can 
						show that the judge wrongly exercised his/her discretion 
						in the particular case. See Nartey-Tokoli vs Volta 
						Aluminium Co. Ltd (1987-88) 2 GLR 532; Guardian 
						Assurance CO. Ltd vs Khayat Trading Store (1972) 2 GLR 
						48; Boullion Industries vs Dizenyoff Gh. Ltd, CA, HI/ 
						8512004 of 30th April 2004 (unreported). As can be seen 
						from the quotation supra, the trial court awarded five 
						million cedis costs in favour of each of the plaintiffs. 
						It is not clear what the reasons were for the award of 
						that amount across board to the plaintiffs. What is 
						obvious however is that the plaintiffs mounted their 
						action jointly. The same counsel represented them. At 
						the trial, the 1st plaintiff testified for all the 
						plaintiffs and they called only one witness. The 
						defendants for their part called only one witness. 
						Besides all these, there is nothing complicated about 
						this case. In the light of the above, I find the 
						defendants&#8217; complaint justified especially when no 
						reasons were assigned for the onerous award. I find 
						support for this position in the dictum of Lord 
						Sterndale M. R. in Ritter v. Godfrey (1920) 2 K.B. 47 @ 
						pp. 52-53, C.A. which was followed by this court in Musa 
						v. Limo-Wulana (1975) 2 G.L.R. 290 @ 300&nbsp; pp Azu Crabbe, 
						C.J. as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;there is such a 
						settled practice of the courts that in the absence of 
						special circumstances a successful litigant should 
						receive his costs; that it is necessary to show some 
						ground for exercising a discretion by refusing an order 
						which would give them to him. The discretion must be 
						judicially exercised, and therefore there must be some 
						grounds for its exercise, for a discretion exercised on 
						no grounds cannot be judicial.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Consequently I set 
						aside the costs of five million cedis awarded to each 
						plaintiff. I enter the defendant is entitled to his 
						costs in this court.</span></p>
