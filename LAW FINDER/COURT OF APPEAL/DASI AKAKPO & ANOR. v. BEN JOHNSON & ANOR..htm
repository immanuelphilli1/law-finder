						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">BROBBEY, J.A.:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">At the start of this 
						litigation, there was only one plaintiff who shall be 
						referred to hereafter as the respondent or first 
						respondent. She claimed in the Circuit Court that she 
						was a sitting tenant on a piece of land at Kantamanto in 
						Accra. She avered that the land was actually owned by 
						the father of the 1st appellant.&nbsp; It was he who allowed 
						his mother to live there.&nbsp; After several years&#8217; stay 
						there, she learnt that the 1st appellant had leased the 
						land to the 2nd appellant in 1989.&nbsp; According to her, 
						the second appellant demolished structures, she and her 
						husband had erected on the land as well as some of the 
						wares they saw there.&nbsp; She therefore issued a writ 
						claiming (a) a declaration that the 1st appellant was 
						wrong in ejecting him without a court order.&nbsp; (b) a 
						declaration that 1st appellant could not by-pass him to 
						lease the same plot given to them by his father.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(c)&nbsp; Damages for 
						unlawful ejectment.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(d) ¢2.5 Million 
						damages for destruction of the respondents building.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(e) General damages for 
						loss of income.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(f) Perpetual 
						injunction to restrain respondents from demolishing her 
						buildings.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After the trial 
						judgment was entered in favour of the 
						plaintiff/respondent.&nbsp; The appellants then appealed to 
						this court against that judgment.&nbsp; Initially the 
						appellants filed one ground of appeal.&nbsp; Later they filed 
						eight additional grounds of appeal. The appeal was 
						allowed on 28/10/99. We now proceed to give our reasons 
						of all the grounds of appeal, the most fundamental ones, 
						which undermined the judgment of the trial court, were 
						grounds four and five which read as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;(4) The learned judge 
						erred in determining the case under the Rent Act. and</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(5) The trial judge 
						erred in joining the P.W.1 as a co-plaintiff&#8221; </span>
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial judge 
						proceeded with the entire case on basis that the statute 
						applicable was the Rent Act (Act.220).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">This is borne out by 
						references in her judgment to the facts that the 
						respondents were statutory tenants, six months statutory 
						notice required to be given under Act. 220. to occupants 
						of business premises, and section 17 (1) (h) of Act. 
						220.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Act.220, S.1 (2) (b) 
						states categorically that the Act does not apply to 
						vacant lands.&nbsp; It provides that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;1(2) (b) This act 
						shall not apply to any lease of any premises where such 
						lease, whether entered into or renewed before, on or 
						after the date of commencement of this act, was entered 
						into or renewed as a lease of land upon which there were 
						no premises at the time of the grant or renewal of the 
						lease&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In paragraph four of 
						the statement of claim the respondents themselves 
						averred that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;Some time ago the late 
						Gilbert Johnson, the father of the first dependant 
						granted a piece of land to the plaintiff at Kantamanto 
						for the purpose of constructing on it a building for her 
						business.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">That only bare land was 
						granted was confirmed by the first respondent and the 
						second respondent or the PW1. Counsel for the respondent 
						simply ignored this powerful admission.&nbsp; He did not 
						comment on it in any way.&nbsp; Since Act.220 was 
						inapplicable to the instant case, the findings of the 
						trial judge that six months notice should have been 
						given under Act. 220 and her further findings of the 
						trial judge that that the respondents were statutory 
						tenants were legally un-sustainable.&nbsp; Those findings 
						were the wrong bases on which to have entered judgment 
						for the respondents.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Secondly, the husband 
						of the plaintiff/respondent who testified throughout the 
						trial as the PW1 was joined as co-plaintiff.&nbsp; The order 
						was made at the very end of the trial by the judge suo 
						motu.&nbsp; She invited no arguments from the parties.&nbsp; There 
						is no doubt that the trial judge had power to order 
						amendments to be made or parties to be joined at any 
						stage of the trial until the judgment had been signed.&nbsp; 
						Where however the parties are before the court, and 
						especially when counsel represents them, it is wrong 
						exercise of discretion to peremptorily make this order 
						suo motu.&nbsp; The position of the PW1 is worse in the 
						instant case because when he testified he gave no 
						indication that he wanted the appellant to pay in any 
						way for whatever they allegedly did to his properties or 
						the land.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The arguments of 
						counsel for the respondent in support of the joinder 
						were that the trial judge was right in joining the PW1 
						because she wanted to avoid the multiplicity of suits. 
						Even if that were the motive for the amendment, the way 
						in which the amendment was effected amounted to 
						non-compliance with the terms of L.I.1129, Order 15, 
						r.5(3) which read </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;No person shall be 
						added as a plaintiff without his consent signified in 
						writing or in such other manner as may be authorised.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial judge ordered 
						the joinder without the PW1 or his solicitor signifying 
						his consent in writing. </span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The trial judge found 
						out that there was a contract in existence between the 
						first respondent and the first appellant.&nbsp; She based her 
						finding on the fact that the plaintiffs were paying rent 
						monthly and therefore were statutory tenants.&nbsp; She 
						concluded:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;I find that at the 
						time the second defendant entered the land the 
						plaintiffs were statutory tenants on the land. The 
						plaintiff&#8217;s presence on the land I find to be lawful.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The status of a 
						statutory tenant comes into being where a tenant under 
						Act.220 continues occupying a house or business premises 
						after the expiration of the tenancy.&nbsp; It has already 
						been explained that Act. 220 does not apply to the facts 
						of the instant case.&nbsp; The entire basis for which the 
						trial judge founded her judgment was wrong.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The respondent was the 
						plaintiff who first went to court and therefore assumed 
						the onus to prove her case.&nbsp; The fundamental issue in 
						this case is on what basis the plaintiff made her claim 
						in court. Unfortunately for her, the basis on which she 
						went to court differed from the basis on which judgment 
						was entered for him.&nbsp; The well established law is that a 
						trial judge should not substitute for a party a case 
						totally different from that which no party put forward; 
						See Dam vrs: Addo (1962) 2 GLR.200, S.C. and Bisi vrs: 
						Tabiri 1984 &#8211; 86 2 GLR. 283 CA.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In her writ of summons, 
						the respondent stated that she sued as a &#8220;sitting 
						tenant&#8221;. That was a nebulous expression because that 
						term could be applied to several tenancies including a 
						tenant farmer in occupation of land, a tenant at will, a 
						tenant at sufferance etc.&nbsp; The onus was on the plaintiff 
						to have established which of these formed the basis of 
						her action but that she failed to do.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the judgment the 
						trial judge attempted to rationalize the basis of the 
						claim by finding that it was the mother of the plaintiff 
						who acquired the land from the father of the second 
						respondent some thirty-five years past. She added that 
						when the P.W.1 met the plaintiff he too had acquired a 
						portion of the land. Those points in the judgment did 
						not answer the basic issue that the exact nature of the 
						acquisition had to be clearly described since that would 
						have determined the nature of notice required to be 
						given before ejecting the plaintiff and the PW1. If they 
						were lessees, the ejectment could only have been valid 
						if it was done in the terms of the lease. No lease was 
						established in this case, let alone how long the 
						respondent and PW1 were permitted to occupy the land 
						before they could be asked to quit.&nbsp; If it was a tenancy 
						under Act.220, statutory notices under Act.220 had to be 
						complied with in order to make the ejectment valid.&nbsp; It 
						has already been explained that Act.220 did not apply to 
						this case.&nbsp; If the plaintiff and the PW1 were tenants at 
						will or tenants at sufferance, their position would have 
						been akin to that of licensees.&nbsp; The facts on the record 
						show that at best the plaintiff and PW1 were licensees.&nbsp; 
						The facts on the record show that at best the plaintiff 
						and PW1 were licenses because all that they were able to 
						prove was that they acquired the land from the father of 
						the first appellant and continued to pay rent.&nbsp; The 
						finding of the trial judge that the respondent and PW1 
						did not oppose the lease of the plot by the first 
						appellant to the second appellant was correct.&nbsp; But that 
						finding demonstrated further that the respondent and the 
						PW1 had no grounds based on a lease or any other 
						contract to resist the move to eject them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Their failure to raise 
						any basis for opposing the ejectment and their 
						willingness to quit lent support to the view that they 
						themselves regarded their stay as licensees and the 
						appellants their licensors.&nbsp; If they were on the land in 
						any other capacity, that capacity was not proved.&nbsp; The 
						alleged offer to grant them alternative place, if true, 
						did not affect their position as licensees.&nbsp; The 
						appellants being defendants at the trial court had no 
						onus to prove how the plaintiff or PW1 acquired the 
						land.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">By definition a bare 
						licensee is a person who, for his own purposes, is 
						permitted by the occupier of property to go or be upon 
						that property, so as not to be a trespasser.&nbsp; The bare 
						licencee has no contractual right to use the land and 
						the occupier may revoke the license at any time.&nbsp; See 
						Osborn&#8217;s Concise law Dictionary, 8th Ed. P.43.&nbsp; A 
						similar definition will be found in &#8220;Ghana land law and 
						conveyance&#8221; by a Rocha &amp; London&#8221;, 1st Ed at p.77 which 
						reads:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;A license is a 
						permission given by owner of land or of an interest in 
						land which allowed the licensee to do certain acts in 
						relation to the land which would without the permission, 
						amount to a trespass.&nbsp; A licence strictly speaking, does 
						that create or confer interest in land.&nbsp; The original 
						common law was that, except in the case of a license 
						complied with an interest in land, a licensor may revoke 
						a licence granted by him.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The definition fits 
						well with the position of the respondent and the PW1 as 
						described by themselves in their pleadings and in the 
						trial court.&nbsp; Since they were licensees, all that was 
						required of the person in the position of licensor was 
						that they had to be given reasonable notice to quite the 
						land.&nbsp; The trial judge found in her judgment that the 
						respondent and PW1 were given three months notice.&nbsp; This 
						was supported by the evidence of the respondent and the 
						PW1.&nbsp; Having regard to this and to the finding of the 
						trial judge that they paid rents monthly, the 
						three-month notice was reasonable.&nbsp; The ejectment of the 
						respondent and PW1 from the land was therefore lawful.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A licensee who will not 
						quit land voluntarily after being given reasonable 
						notice may be ejected by reasonable means.&nbsp; The hard 
						facts in this case are that the properties of the 
						respondent and the PW1 on the disputed land were 
						eventually removed from there in order to pave the way 
						for the occupation of the second appellant.&nbsp; While the 
						respondent and PW1 maintained that the properties were 
						carried away by the first appellant, the appellants aver 
						that it was the respondent and the PW1 who voluntarily 
						carried their own belongings from the land.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In resolving this 
						issue, the trial judge failed to consider the most 
						material evidence, which the parties themselves adduced 
						before her and that related to the presence or absence 
						of the respondents during the demolition.&nbsp; In her 
						evidence in court, the plaintiff said that the 
						demolition of the structures took place in her absence.&nbsp; 
						In Exhibit I, written in 1992 when the facts of the case 
						were more fresh in his memory, the PW1 stated in no 
						uncertain terms that the demolition took place in his 
						absence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">He even gave the 
						impression in that petition, exhibit 1, that the 2nd 
						appellant himself did not demolish the structure but 
						rather &#8220;motivated people&#8221; to do that for him.&nbsp; While 
						testifying in court, this same PW1 said the demolition 
						took place in his presence.&nbsp; Even more startling was the 
						time of the demolition.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In Exhibit 1, the PW1 
						stated that there were two demolitions and they took 
						place at intervals of three days.&nbsp; In court he said they 
						took place at intervals of one year.&nbsp; These are serious 
						conflicts which should have led the trial judge to 
						disbelieve the stories of the respondent and the PW1.&nbsp; 
						The material conflicts confirm the contention of the 
						appellants that no demolition took place but probably 
						the PW1 and the respondent voluntarily carted their 
						structures from the land.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It has already been 
						explained that the respondent and PW1 were mere licences 
						who were given reasonable notice to quit.&nbsp; Their 
						ejectment was therefore lawful because as licences, they 
						needed no court order to be ejected.&nbsp; The issuance of 
						six months notice and a court order would have been 
						relevant if Act.220 were applicable to the instant 
						case.&nbsp; But, as already explained, this case cannot be 
						determined under Act.220 since it covered vacant land.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">If a person is granted 
						vacant land even on leasehold basis, the fact that the 
						lessee develops that land does not prevent the lessor 
						from entering into another lease with a third party in 
						respect of the same land.&nbsp; What the lessor can or cannot 
						do will depend on the terms of the lease.&nbsp; In the 
						instant case, the respondent and PW1 as well as their 
						witnesses failed to establish that there was any lease 
						and what the terms of the lease were. Since the evidence 
						disclosed that the PW1 and the respondent were licensees 
						relief (b) failed.&nbsp; That relief sought a declaration 
						that the appellant could not by pass them to enter into 
						a lease with the 2nd appellant.&nbsp; Relief (c) which was a 
						claim for damages too failed because the ejectment of 
						the respondent and the PW1 were lawful.&nbsp; Damages cannot 
						obviously be ordered to be paid for a lawful act.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Similarly, there was no 
						basis for the reliefs in (d) and (e) in the face of the 
						evidence that it was the respondent and PW1 who 
						voluntarily carted their structures and belongings from 
						the land.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The last relief in (f) 
						also failed since the trail judge found that the 
						respondent and the PW1 did not oppose the lease of the 
						land to the 2nd appellants.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">It is obvious from this 
						judgment, the testimonies of the respondent and the PW1 
						as well as the findings of the trial judge that the 
						respondent and PW1 have no lawful claims to the disputed 
						land. Relief one of the counter&#8212;claim succeeded and 
						should have been granted by the trial judge.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">No evidence was led by 
						the appellants not their witnesses on the claim for ¢5 
						Million for obstructing the 2nd respondent&#8217;s building 
						operations on the land.&nbsp; The evidence was however clear 
						that 2nd respondent&#8217;s building on the land was somehow 
						obstructed.&nbsp; I would enter judgment for appellant.&nbsp; 
						Since no monetary value was placed on that, only nominal 
						damages could be awarded for him. One Hundred Thousand 
						Cedis will suffice as nominal damages for the 2nd 
						appellant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Form the foregoing, the 
						appellants are entitled to an order of perpetual 
						injunction against the respondent and the PW1 since by 
						their own showing and the findings of the trial judge 
						they do not oppose the lease of the land to the 1st 
						appellant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">For the foregoing 
						reasons, the appeal succeeds and is allowed.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">ABANKWA:&nbsp; Respondents 
						say they are not on the disputed land.&nbsp; They live on
