						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">A brief background to 
						this application for stay of proceedings pending appeal 
						is as follows: On 12th June, 2002 the 
						plaintiffs/respondents issued a Writ of Summons in the 
						circuit court, Accra for a liquidated sum of 
						¢10,295,000.00. At the time of the issue of the Writ of 
						Summons the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court was 
						limited by section 41(1) (a) (i) of Courts Act, 1963, 
						(Act 459) to ¢10,000,000.00. On 30th April 2003 while 
						hearing of the case was still pending the 
						defendants/applicants filed an application before the 
						circuit court to strike out the suit for want of 
						jurisdiction. The Circuit court dismissed the 
						application and ruled that it had jurisdiction to 
						entertain the action on the basis that by their pleading 
						and their conduct the defendants/applicants had agreed 
						that the circuit court should assume jurisdiction as 
						required by section 41(3) of Courts Act, 1993 (Act 459). 
						That subsection reads: &#8220;Where the amount claimed or the 
						value of any land or property exceeds the amount or 
						value specified in subsection (1) of this section the 
						Circuit Court shall, not withstanding that section, 
						proceed to hear the case if the parties agree it should 
						do so&#8221;. Also, the circuit court&#8217;s other reason for 
						assuming jurisdiction in the matter was that at the time 
						the plaintiff&#8217;s witness testified in court on 1st April 
						2003 its jurisdiction had been enhanced from ¢10,000,000 
						to ¢100,000,000. The applicant appealed against the 
						ruling of the circuit court and applied to this court 
						for stay of proceedings in respect of the substantive 
						suit before that court. The application is brought under 
						rule 27A of Court of Appeal Rules, 1977 (C.I. 19) as 
						amended by Court of Appeal (Amendment) Rules, 1998 (C.I. 
						21) (l) which reads: &#8220;The Court may in any interlocutory 
						appeal, civil or criminal before it, grant stay of 
						proceedings pending the determination of the 
						interlocutory appeal subject to such terms as the Court 
						considers fit.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As pointed out by the 
						submission of learned counsel for the applicants, at the 
						time the writ was issued, in terms of section 41 (1) (a) 
						(i) of the Court&#8217;s Act, the circuit court had no 
						jurisdiction to hear the case since the amount claimed 
						by the respondents exceeded the jurisdiction of the 
						circuit court and the applicants did not agree to the 
						hearing of the case by that court as required by section 
						41(3) of Act 459. The two main reasons which the circuit 
						court gave for its ruling dismissing the motion to 
						strike out the writ for want of jurisdiction before it 
						appear at page 2 of its ruling, exhibit ST as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;It is a cardinal rule 
						of pleadings that a party is bound by his pleadings. He 
						cannot plead one set of facts and at the trial base his 
						case on different facts. Every allegation of facts in 
						any pleadings, which a party does not admit, must be 
						denied expressly or by necessary implication. A failure 
						to deny will be deemed to be an admission except against 
						a person with a disability. Section 41(3) of Act 459 
						does not provide that the parties should expressly in 
						writing or by oral submission confer jurisdiction, so I 
						had that the defendants agreed by conduct and by 
						implication of law to confer jurisdiction on this court. 
						Nothing had been a nullity up to this stage.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I also rule that on the 
						1st of April, 2003, when the plaintiff gave his 
						evidence-in-chief, and counsel for the defendants 
						cross-examined him, this court&#8217;s jurisdiction has been 
						enhanced by Act 620, to ¢100 million.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Counsel for the 
						applicants referred the court to the Supreme Court case 
						of Ababio II and Another v. Akro &amp; Co., and others, 
						[1963] 1 G.L.R. 195. In that case, after Mr. Pullen had 
						retired as Court of the Reserve Settlement Commissioner 
						in the course of an enquiry, Mr. P. M. Riley was 
						appointed to continue with the enquiry. Even though the 
						law permitted continuation of the enquiry from where the 
						previous Commissioner left off provided that the parties 
						gave their consent, Mr. Riley did not wait for their 
						consent but assumed that they had given their consent 
						for him to continue with the enquiry and this was what 
						the Supreme Court had to say at page 199 of the report 
						per Ollennu, J.S.C.:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8220;What is the legal 
						effect of this? Since Mr. Riley did not begin the 
						enquiry, but was appointed under section 5(2) in 
						substitution for Mr. Pullen who had started it, his 
						jurisdiction to continue it depended entirely upon the 
						consent of the parties as provided in the said 
						subsection (2) of section 5 which is as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&#8216;Where the Reserve 
						Settlement Commissioner has, prior to such appointment, 
						begun to hold, but has not completed, an enquiry under 
						the provisions of section 9 of this Ordinance, the 
						person appointed to act on his behalf or in succession 
						to him shall not be obliged to begin the enquiry de novo 
						but may, if he so thinks fit, and with the consent of 
						all the parties thereto, continue and complete the 
						enquiry so begun but not completed&#8217;&#8230;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Without that consent he 
						is void of jurisdiction, and he should not have 
						continued the enquiry&#8230; In the first place the 
						commissioner misdirected himself when he said that he 
						could continue the enquiry provided there is no 
						objection. The Ordinance says &#8216;with the consent of all 
						the parties,&#8217; which we interpret to be the express, not 
						presumed, consent of each of the parties before the 
						court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Now the record of 
						proceedings shows that the commissioner did not obtain 
						the consent of any of the parties; there is nothing to 
						show that he even read out to them the notes he made as 
						to his presumption that he could continue if no 
						objection is raised. He appears to have assumed that if 
						no objection was raised he became vested with 
						jurisdiction.&#8221;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instant 
						application, on the circuit judge&#8217;s own showing he did 
						not make any effort to ascertain from the parties 
						whether they agreed to his proposal to go on with the 
						case in spite of the fact that the amount claimed 
						exceeded the circuit court&#8217;s jurisdiction of 
						¢10,000,000.00 which prevailed at the time. He presumed 
						that he became vested with jurisdiction since he did not 
						encounter any objection from the either of the parties, 
						notably the applicants, the defendants in the 
						substantive suit. In his submissions counsel for the 
						applicants pointed out that Article 107 (b) of the 1992 
						Constitution would not permit Act 620 to operate 
						retrospectively. According to Article 107 (b) of the 
						Constitution, &#8220;Parliament shall have no power to pass 
						any law &#8212; which operates retrospectively to impose any 
						limitations on, or to adversely affect the personal 
						rights or liberties of any person or to impose a burden, 
						obligation or liability on any person except in the case 
						of a law enacted under articles 178 to 182 of this 
						Constitution&#8221;. Counsel also referred to the Supreme 
						Court case of Republic v. High Court, Denu; ex parte 
						Avadarli [1993-94] 1 G.L.R. 561 in support of his 
						contention that objection to jurisdiction of the court 
						can be taken at any time.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">On the circuit court&#8217;s 
						ruling that it had jurisdiction to hear the case on the 
						coming into force of the Courts (Amendment) Act, 2002 
						(Act 620) if failed to take into account the date of 
						commencement of the said Act 620 being 1st December 2002 
						as stated in Courts (Amendment) Act (Commencement) 
						Instrument, 2002 (E.I. 33). In the light of the wording 
						of article 107 of the Constitution quoted above I do not 
						think that the learned circuit judge was entitled to 
						come to the conclusion that he had jurisdiction to 
						entertain the case before him on the basis that the 
						jurisdiction of the circuit court had been enhanced to 
						¢100,000,000 on account of E.I. 33 which came into force 
						prior to the plaintiff&#8217;s oral testimony in court. I am 
						of the opinion that this is a proper case where the 
						application for stay of proceedings ought to be granted. 
						It is accordingly granted.</span></p>
