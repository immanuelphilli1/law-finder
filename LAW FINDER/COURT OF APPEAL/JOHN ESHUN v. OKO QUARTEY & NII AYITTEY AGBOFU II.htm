						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In this judgment I 
						would refer to the plaintiff/respondent as simply the 
						plaintiff, the defendant/appellant and 
						co-defendants/appellants as defendant and co-defendants 
						respectively. The plaintiff's claim against the 
						defendant is for the following reliefs: &quot;(a) Ejection 
						from the land situate off Avenor comprising site plan 
						No. ACA 3095822 measuring 40' x 120' x 110' x 100', 
						which the Ghana Railway Corporation gave to the 
						plaintiff in [1998] and which land the defendant has 
						refused to vacate same in spite of repeated demands. (b) 
						General Damages for trespass&quot;. According to his 
						Statement of Claim the plaintiff is a grantee of the 
						Ghana Railway Corporation in respect of the land 
						described in the writ of summons. That land forms part 
						of land acquired by the Government of Ghana in 1909. 
						About six months prior to the issue of the writ of 
						summons the defendant trespassed on the land and put up 
						wooden structures on it. In spite of warning from the 
						plaintiff the defendant persisted in his acts of 
						trespass. The defendants' stand is that he had been in 
						uninterrupted possession of the land in dispute 
						twenty-four years prior to the alleged trespass on the 
						land. His possession followed a grant by the Ashong 
						Kwaku family of Avenor. He maintains that the wooden 
						structure complained of was put up by him some four 
						years before the challenge from the plaintiff, on the 
						land of which he had been in possession. On the very day 
						hearing in the case concluded on 6th November 1998 an 
						application for joinder was filed on behalf of the 
						co-defendants.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After the court had 
						granted the application for joinder the co-defendants 
						filed their defence and counterclaimed for what looked 
						like declaratory reliefs namely: &quot;(a) That they are the 
						traditional allodial owners of a larger area of land of 
						which the portion in dispute forms a part as same is 
						described by paragraph 2 of Statement of Claim. (b) The 
						plaintiff is unknown to the co-defendants and has no 
						right to disturb the defendant who is known to them 
						customarily&quot;. The contention of the co-defendants in 
						support of the defendants stand is that as allodial 
						owners of a much wider area of land, which embraced the 
						land in dispute they approved of the grant of the land 
						by Ashong-Lamptey family to the defendant. The two 
						concluding paragraphs of the judgment of the court below 
						read as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;From the totality of 
						the evidence adduced in court the plaintiff is entitled 
						to his claim as per the writ of summons. I therefore 
						make an order that the defendant herein should vacate 
						forthwith from the plot in dispute and yield up vacant 
						possession to the plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The plaintiff is not 
						entitled to his claim for general damages since he has 
						not lost anything as a result of the litigation by the 
						defendants. Costs of ¢500,000 is however awarded against 
						the defendant and co-defendants.&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Originally only one 
						Ground of Appeal was filed, namely &quot;The judgment of His 
						Honour the judge cannot be supported by the plaintiff's 
						claim with regard to the evidence&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Later twenty Additional 
						Grounds were filed which are listed below as follows:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;(1) The judgment is 
						against the weight of the evidence on record.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(2) The court below 
						failed to bring the analytical mind to the several 
						conflicting pieces of evidence on record.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(3) The court below 
						failed to observe the plaintiff's averment of a lease 
						from the Ghana Railway Corporation from 1988 is not 
						supported by his own exhibits 'B' and 'C', which recite 
						leaseholds commencing from 1997 and 1998 respectively.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(4) The court below was 
						inadvertent to the fact that exhibit 'C' dated 15-9-98 
						was obtained by the plaintiff POST MOTAM LITEM and as 
						such had no cogency or evidential value since the writ 
						was then subsisting as from 10-6-97.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(5) The court failed to 
						appreciate that the plaintiff's failure to tender a 
						certified true copy of the alleged state acquisition for 
						the Ghana Railway to extend of the corporation's right 
						of use and right to lease was fatal to the success of 
						the plaintiff's case. The court was left in the state of 
						uncertainty and conjecture as to the extent of the 
						Corporation's right or power to devise or sublet the 
						land concerned.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(6) The court below 
						failed to advert its mind to the plaintiff's admission 
						that the object of the Railway Corporation is to run the 
						Railway business vis-a-vis the plaintiff's own evidence 
						that he had taken the alleged lease for the different 
						object of selling LIQUIDFIED GAS.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(7) The trial court 
						failed to give effect to the plaintiff's admission that 
						the defendant was in occupation of part of the disputed 
						land before he purported to acquire a portion from the 
						Railway Corporation.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(8) The court below 
						failed to give effect to the [unrefuted] and 
						[undestroyed] evidence of long possession on record.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(9) The court failed to 
						carry justice by resolving the several pieces of OATH 
						AGAINST OATH against the defendant and co-defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(10) The court below 
						failed to give effect to Article 20 Clauses (5) and (6) 
						of the 1992 Constitution as well as Articles 267, 164 of 
						1969 and 190 of [1997] Constitution.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(11) The court below 
						miscarried justice by merely finding that the plaintiff 
						is a tenant of the Railway Corporation who are the 
						owners of the plot' without adverting to the effect of 
						this finding on plaintiff's locus standi and Railway 
						laches and acquiescence.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(12) The court below 
						erred grossly in rejecting the defendant's grantor's 
						statutory declaration, which was the defendant's 
						immediate ROOT OF TITLE, which the defendant was obliged 
						by law to establish (Page 55 of the Record).</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(13) The court below 
						misunderstood the case of the defendant and co-defendant 
						to the effect that the purported licence to the 
						plaintiff for gas sales the Corporation diverted from 
						the Railway business and offended against Article 20 
						Clauses (5) and (6) of the 1992 Constitution and 
						wrongfully assumed that the attack was upon the 
						plaintiff directly instead of upon the Corporation his 
						purported licensor.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(14) The court below 
						also misdirected itself by holding that the right of 
						complaint lay not in the mouth of the defendant and 
						co-defendant... but only in the corporation.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(15) The court below 
						erred in finding that it was surprising that the 
						DEFENDANT failed to join the Railway Corporation to this 
						action whereas it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to do 
						so if that was advisable to him. The court put the onus 
						on the wrong party.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(16) The court below 
						failed to direct itself to the law that the defendant 
						has a legal right to direct a counterclaim straight 
						against the plaintiff who has brought him to court and 
						not necessarily against a 3rd party not before the 
						court.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(17) The court below 
						missed the point about the tradition of the defendant's 
						root of title when it held that the evidence of the 
						co-defendant gave was 'anything but convincing to sway 
						the case in favour of the defendant'.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(18) The court below 
						misdirected itself in holding the grant to the defendant 
						ineffective because it was not effectuated as required 
						by the Conveyancing Decree... whereas prior to the 
						Decree, it was not obligatory for customary grants to be 
						documented at all nor evidenced in writing.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(19) The trial court 
						failed to appreciate that rejecting or dismissing the 
						plaintiff's claim for general damages for trespass 
						presupposes that the defendant was properly in 
						possession of the disputed land and therefore not liable 
						for the first claim for ejectment either... The trial 
						court committed a miscarriage of justice by not 
						dismissing the plaintiff's case totally.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">(20) Since the 
						plaintiff's two-fold claims failed as to the half of it, 
						the court below failed to do justice by not granting 
						costs to the defendant and co-defendant&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I would take at one go 
						the original Ground of Appeal together with Additional 
						Grounds 1,2,3,4,7,8 and 9. I have elected to pursue that 
						course on account of the fact that all the grounds of 
						appeal listed above have something to do with the trial 
						circuit judge's alleged failure to resolve the issues 
						raised by the conflicting accounts by the plaintiff and 
						the defendant relating to the plaintiff's presence on 
						the land in dispute. According to the plaintiff he came 
						onto the land in 1988 after he had procured a licence 
						from the Ghana Railway Corporation, the owners of the 
						land. The challenge from the defendant is to the effect 
						that it was he who permitted the plaintiff to be on the 
						land. The plaintiff tendered in evidence exhibits B and 
						C, which represent two licences which he procured from 
						the Ghana Railway Corporation. Exhibit B is dated 1st 
						March 1997, three months before the writ of summons was 
						issued. Exhibit C is dated 15th September 1998, which 
						was after the issue of the writ and therefore would be 
						of no relevance to the matter before the court as 
						submitted in defendant's and co-defendants' written 
						Statement of their case. It is worthy of note that 
						exhibit B was the only licence procured by the plaintiff 
						from the Ghana Railway Corporation before the issuance 
						of the writ of summons. In fact even though the 
						plaintiff testifies that he obtained permission from the 
						Ghana Railway Corporation in 1988 to operate his gas 
						business on the land no licence was produced by him to 
						indicate that his relationship with the Ghana Railway 
						Corporation started from a date earlier than 1st March 
						1997 as represented on exhibit B. In what appears to be 
						the plaintiff's desperate attempt to convince the court 
						that his presence on the land in 1988 was as a result of 
						licence from Ghana Railway Corporation, he gave the 
						following oral testimony before the court, which is 
						recorded at page 16 of the record of appeal as follows: 
						&quot;On 17/2/88 I made a search. [Tendered in evidence and 
						marked exhibit A.]&nbsp; The Search concluded that the plot 
						was for Ghana Railway Corporation. I had licence from 
						Ghana Railway Corporation to operate the land measuring 
						120' x 110' x 60' x 60' x 40'&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In actual fact the 
						plaintiff filed the search, exhibit A on 17/2/98, which 
						was eight months after the filing of the writ of 
						summons, as depicted by the RECEIVING STAMP of the Lands 
						Registry which appears at the top of exhibit A. He did 
						not file the search on 17/2/88 as implied by his sworn 
						evidence in court. It is very obvious that the reason 
						why the plaintiff sought to mislead the court into 
						believing that he filed the search ten years earlier was 
						his attempt to buttress his contention that it was not 
						the plaintiff but the Ghana Railway Corporation that 
						permitted him to be on the land in the first instance. 
						The plaintiff's assertion that his presence on the land 
						was at the instance of the Ghana Railway Corporation is 
						not backed by any written licence from Ghana Railway 
						Corporation. Also the plaintiff has not led evidence to 
						establish that he had any form of permission, oral or 
						documentary from the Ghana Railway Corporation to be on 
						the land. It means the defendant's stand that it was he 
						who permitted the plaintiff to be on the land is more 
						plausible and the learned trial circuit judge should 
						have ruled on that issue. According to the defendants 
						oral testimony in court he had been on the land for 
						twenty-four years without encountering challenge from 
						any quarter. He denied that the land belonged to Ghana 
						Railway Corporation and maintained that the Ashong 
						Family own the land. According to him the plaintiff came 
						to him and asked for the land. Even though he had 
						planted hedges around the land he cut the hedges and 
						gave a portion of the land to the plaintiff.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">Another important area, 
						which the defendant and co-defendant seek to address, is 
						the capacity of the plaintiff to bring the action 
						against the defendant in the first place. That brings us 
						to our consideration of Additional Grounds 11, 15 and 16 
						respectively namely &quot;(11) The court below miscarried 
						justice by merely finding that 'the plaintiff is a 
						tenant of the Railway Corporation who are the owners of 
						the plot' without adverting to the effect of this 
						finding on plaintiff's locus standi and Railway laches 
						and aquiescence. (15) The court below erred in finding 
						that it was surprising that the DEFENDANT failed to join 
						the Railway Corporation to this action whereas it was 
						incumbent upon the plaintiff to do so if that was 
						advisable to him. The court put the onus on the wrong 
						party. (16) The court below failed to direct itself to 
						the law that the defendant has a legal right to direct a 
						counterclaim straight against the plaintiff who has 
						brought him to court and not necessarily against a 3rd 
						party not before the court&quot;. The contention of the 
						defendant's and co-defendants' counsel is to the effect 
						that being mere licensee the plaintiff is not entitled 
						to bring the action against the defendant in the first 
						place.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the case of Heap v. 
						Hartley reported in 42 C.D. 461, C.A. it was held that 
						an exclusive licence is a leave to do a thing, and a 
						contract not to allow someone else to do the thing; but, 
						unless coupled with a grant, it confers no more than any 
						other licence any interest or property in the thing, and 
						the licensee has no title to sue in his own name. In 
						that case Fry, L.J. said at page 470 of the report:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;An exclusive license 
						is only a license in one sense; that is to say, the true 
						nature of an exclusive license is this. It is a leave to 
						do a thing, and a contract not to give leave to anybody 
						else to do the same thing. But it confers like any other 
						license, no interest or property, but the licence pure 
						and simple, and by itself, never conveys an interest in 
						property. It only enables a person to do lawfully what 
						he could not otherwise do, except unlawfully. I think, 
						therefore, that an exclusive licensee has no title 
						whatsoever to sue&quot;.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In the instant case the 
						plaintiff relies on licence from the Ghana Railway 
						Corporation in pursuit of his claim for ejectment of the 
						defendant from the land in dispute and secondly for 
						damages for trespass. Even though as a licensee the 
						plaintiff might not be in the position to purse a claim 
						in furtherance of the interests of his licensor, Ghana 
						Railway Corporation, would he not be entitled to pursue 
						a claim in respect of his own interest? According to the 
						terms of the licence the plaintiff is entitled to take 
						possession of the land, which is described in the 
						attached site plan. That means provided he takes 
						possession of the land described in the writ of summons 
						he ought to be in the position to challenge any 
						trespasser who invades his rights. To maintain his 
						action for trespass there is the need for the plaintiff 
						to establish that he and not the defendant was in 
						possession at the time of the alleged invasion of his 
						right. The learned authors B.J. Da Rocha and C.H.K. 
						Lodoh at page 97 of the second edition of their book, 
						Ghana Land Law and Conveyances have this to say on 
						&quot;possession&quot;:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;Possession of land 
						usually means actual physical possession of the land or 
						the right to immediate possession of the land. For 
						example, a lessee may be in physical possession of the 
						land of the lessor but such a lessor has an immediate 
						right to possession of the leased land when the lease 
						terminates either by expiry or by the occurrence of an 
						event expressly provided for in the lease as terminating 
						it. Possession is of great importance in land law. The 
						rule of the English common law, which has been 
						assimilated into the common law of Ghana, is that 
						possession by itself gives a good title to land against 
						the whole world except someone having a better legal 
						right to possession. In Wuta-Ofei v Danquah, the Privy 
						Council held inter alia that:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">'... the possession 
						which the respondent sought to maintain was against the 
						appellant who never had any title to the land. Hence the 
						slightest amount of possession would be sufficient; and 
						since there was no evidence that the respondent ever 
						abandoned her possession, which she obtained by virtue 
						of the 1939 grant and the only reasonable inference from 
						the evidence is an intention to retain possession, she 
						had satisfied the test and was entitled to maintain an 
						action for trespass.'&quot;</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">After having endorsed 
						the plaintiff's entitlement to sue for trespass on 
						condition that he was in possession of the land in 
						dispute at the time of the alleged trespass, the all 
						important issue to resolve is whether or not he was 
						actually in possession of the land in dispute at the 
						time that the alleged trespass was committed by the 
						defendant.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">As discussed earlier in 
						this judgment it is not in dispute that the defendant 
						was already in possession of the land before the 
						plaintiff's arrival to occupy a portion of it as far 
						back as 1988. Since the plaintiff's assertion that he 
						had licence from the Ghana Railway Corporation in 1988 
						to be on the land has no support from the evidence on 
						record it is quite safe to prefer the version of the 
						defendant that it was he who in 1988 permitted the 
						plaintiff to be on the land. It appears for nine years 
						or so that the plaintiff and the defendant remained on 
						the land in peaceful co-existence. It is very obvious 
						that it was in 1997 when the defendant procured the 
						licence, exhibit B from Ghana Railway Corporation that 
						trouble started. There is no indication on record that 
						prior to the procurement of exhibit B the plaintiff had 
						obtained any permission from Ghana Railway Corporation 
						to carry on with his trade on the land. Exhibit B, which 
						is a letter, is headed &quot;PERMISSION TO OPERATE 
						TEMPORARILY ON RAILWAY LAND AT OFF AVENOR&quot;, followed by 
						the sentence: &quot;The attached site plan No. ACA 3095 D22 
						shows by pink verge the site measuring approximately 40' 
						x 120' x 110' x 60' x 100' being considered on licence 
						for your temporary use&quot;. The letter ends in the 
						following words:</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;The use or occupation 
						of the site is purely temporary arrangement and does not 
						confer to licensee any preferential claim to have the 
						site leased to him or her. If the above terms are 
						acceptable to you kindly indicate to enable us register 
						you accordingly&quot;. According to the terms exhibit B was 
						supposed to be a yearly tenancy arrangement and that is 
						confirmed by exhibit C whose terms are exact 
						reproduction of exhibit B. Therefore the plaintiff's 
						testimony to the effect that exhibit B was a renewal of 
						his first licence, which he obtained in 1988 cannot 
						represent the true position. If indeed his first licence 
						were in 1988 he would have had at least eight renewals 
						of that licence before exhibit B was issued in 1997.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The boundary owners to 
						the attached plan in exhibit B are not specified and 
						that is an indication that the plan was prepared without 
						any reference to the defendant's prior occupation of the 
						land, which the plaintiff undoubtedly admits. It stands 
						to reason that since the defendant was already in 
						possession before the plaintiff obtained the licence 
						from Ghana Railway Corporation care should have been 
						taken to ensure that the area demarcated in the plan 
						attached to exhibit B does not fall within any portion 
						of the area occupied by the defendant. Since that was 
						not done it becomes totally impossible to determine 
						whether or not the area in dispute falls within the area 
						occupied by the defendant prior to the arrival of the 
						plaintiff on the land.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">The counterclaim of the 
						co-defendants has to do with ownership of the land in 
						dispute, which bears no relationships with the 
						plaintiff's claim. As expressed earlier in this judgment 
						the plaintiff as licensee would have the capacity to 
						litigate only in respect of his own interest but not in 
						respect of ownership of the land in dispute which falls 
						within the domain of the licensor, Ghana Railway 
						Corporation. The co-defendants' challenge of the 
						plaintiff's capacity to sue should be seen as pertinent 
						only in respect of the interests of Ghana Railway 
						Corporation. In the same vein their counterclaim, which 
						constitutes a challenge to the alleged claim of 
						ownership of the land in dispute by Ghana Railway 
						Corporation cannot legitimately be addressed to the 
						plaintiff who as only a licensee admittedly lacks the 
						capacity to litigate in respect of the interest of Ghana 
						Railway Corporation.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">I quite agree with the 
						sentiment expressed by the learned circuit judge that 
						the right thing to do was for the co-defendants to have 
						joined Ghana Railway Corporation as a party in the case 
						because that would afford the court the opportunity to 
						effectively deal with all the issues in the controversy. 
						As it turned out the absence of Ghana Railway 
						Corporation as party in the case rendered the whole 
						exercise of prosecuting the counterclaim of the 
						co-defendants otiose. On account of this I do not think 
						it is worthwhile to go into the merits of remaining 
						grounds of appeal, which have to do with the 
						counterclaim of co-defendants, which by implication was 
						wrongly directed at the plaintiff. For the reasons given 
						in this judgment the appeal succeeds in respect of the 
						judgment of the court below relating to the plaintiff's 
						claim. The appeal in that regard is allowed and the 
						judgment and costs of the court below are set aside. It 
						is rather strange that even though the learned circuit 
						judge did not make any pronouncement on the outcome of 
						the counterclaim of the co-defendants he awarded costs 
						against them.</span></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
						<span style="font-family: Arial">In any case the 
						co-defendants did not make that a ground of appeal.</span></p>
