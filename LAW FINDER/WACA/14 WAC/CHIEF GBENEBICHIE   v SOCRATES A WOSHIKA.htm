												The dispute related to rents of 
												family land which the Family 
												Head gave out on leases effected 
												in his own name. A family 
												meeting was held and certain 
												Resolutions made, to which 
												effect was given by a Memorandum 
												of amendments to the previous 
												&quot;Constitution, etc.&quot;, which was 
												replaced later by a new &quot; 
												Constitution and Regulations of 
												the Omateye Family Fund &quot;. The 
												amended Constitution appointed 
												the three respondents as 
												Trustees of the Fund consisting 
												of the rents, and a Committee of 
												Management consisting of the 
												Trustees and four other nominees 
												of the family including the 
												Family Head, to whom £80 was to 
												be paid for life</span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 8.4pt; margin-left: 2.15pt; margin-right: .7pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Memorandum of amendments 
												bore the thumb-print of the 
												Family Head and an interpreter's 
												certificate and the signature of 
												the District Officer as a 
												witness. The new&quot; Constitution&quot; 
												also bore the signatures of the 
												Family Head and of the other 
												members of the Committee. In 
												between he and they executed a 
												document authorising the 
												District Officer to pay amounts 
												on deposit and belonging to the 
												Family and future rents to the 
												Trust Fund. The Family Head 
												attended several Committee 
												meetings and received his first 
												£80. Later he refused to show 
												the Trustees copies of leases he 
												had granted; he demanded but 
												they with­held the next £80; 
												then he sent a&quot; Notice of 
												Withdrawal&quot; from the 
												Resolutions, and continued to 
												collect the rents but did not 
												hand them over to the Trustees, 
												who then sued the Family Head 
												and nine others jointly and 
												severally for a sum which the 
												plaintiffs alleged the 
												defendants received on leases of 
												family property for the use of 
												the Fund of which the plaintiffs 
												were the Trustees. The Family 
												Head put in a separate defence 
												saying he had received the rents 
												but was not liable to account, 
												and in his evidence denied 
												understanding the documents he 
												had signed. </span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 8.4pt; margin-left: 2.15pt; margin-right: .7pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial Judge did not believe 
												him but non-suited the Trustees 
												on the ground that the action 
												had been improperly brought 
												against&quot; the defendants jointly 
												and severally in their capacity 
												as members of the Committee of 
												Management ... against the 
												defendant (the Family Head) as 
												one member of that Committee &quot;, 
												and ordered the parties to bear 
												their own costs .. The first 
												defendant-the Family 
												Head-appealed and is referred to 
												as the appellant; the plaintiffs 
												also appealed but are referred 
												to as the respondents in the 
												judgment </span><i>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												infra </span></i>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												for clearness' sake: they are 
												the Trustees of the Fund to whom 
												the Family Head should have 
												handed over the rents he 
												collected. </span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 8.4pt; margin-left: 2.15pt; margin-right: .7pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Family Head argued that the 
												suit against him should have 
												been </span><i>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												dismissed </span></i>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												on the ground that the Trustees 
												(the plaintiffs) did not prove 
												their case against him, and that 
												the case was fought on the 
												footing that he was sued in a 
												representa­tive capacity as a 
												member of the Committee of 
												Management. (The Writ of Summons 
												stated his name and the nine 
												others, and below the ten names 
												of the defendants were the 
												words&quot; Committee of Management 
												The Itsekiri National Fund&quot;; and 
												in a paragraph of the Statement 
												of Claim the defendants were
												</span><font color="#FF0000">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												[pg 101] </span></font>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												described as the Itsekiri 
												National Fund and the Family 
												Head as the agent of that Fund.) 
												His other ground was that the 
												Memorandum and the new 
												Con­stitution were &quot;instruments&quot; 
												within the meaning of the Land 
												Registration Ordinance and not 
												being registered as required by 
												section 6 thereof, could not 
												have been admitted in evidence 
												in view of section 15. He also 
												argued that if the new&quot; 
												Constitution&quot; were held to be 
												binding upon him, he would be 
												divesting himself of his 
												responsibilities as Head of the 
												Family contrary to customary 
												law, which knew nothing of 
												trusteeship. </span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 9.8pt; margin-left: .95pt; margin-right: .95pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												For the Trustees (who also 
												appealed) it was argued that 
												they ought not to have been 
												non-suited; that the evidence 
												established the Family Head's 
												liability and the Judge should 
												have amended the proceedings.
												</span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 9.1pt; margin-left: 2.85pt; margin-right: .2pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Held: (1) The documents in 
												question were not an assurance, 
												nor were they intended to be 
												one; their main object was to 
												create a trust fund into which 
												family rents should be paid; 
												they were not&quot; instruments&quot; 
												within the meaning of the Land 
												Registration Ordinance, and they 
												were properly admitted in 
												evidence. </span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 9.8pt; margin-left: .95pt; margin-right: .95pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) The documents were binding 
												on the Family Head: he 
												understood them and accepted a 
												benefit under them, viz. the 
												payment of £80 in accordance 
												with the documents. </span></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 9.8pt; margin-left: .95pt; margin-right: .95pt">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3) The Family Head was sued 
												with the others jointly and 
												severally; descriptive 
												statements could not turn the 
												suit into one against them in a 
												representative capacity; no 
												amendment was necessary, but if 
												any had been necessary, the 
												trial Judge ought to have made 
												it and settled the real 
												controversy instead of 
												non-suiting the plaintiffs.

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(4) The Family Head admitted 
												having received the money 
												claimed by the Trustees and the 
												issue fought was his liability 
												to pay that money to them; the 
												Trustees ought to have had 
												judgment in their favour. </span>

												failed to prove their case

												representative capacity as a 
												member of the Committee of

												wrongly admitted in evidence as 
												they are .. instruments&quot; within 
												the meaning of the Land 
												Registration Ordinance (Cap. 
												108), and their admission in 
												evidence is prohibited by 
												section 15 of the Ordinance 
												because they were not registered 
												as required by section 6; that 
												the learned trial Judge 
												misdirected himself on the facts 
												and came to wrong conclusions as

												conception of trusteeship is 
												foreign to Native Law and Custom 
												and the trial Judge was wrong in 
												concluding that the appellant,

												As I have already pointed out,

												appellant and the other 
												defendants are described against 
												the names at the head of the 
												summons as .. Committee of 
												Management The Itsekiri National 
												Fund &quot;, but in my view that is 
												merely descriptive. Much was 
												made in argument of the wording 
												of paragraph 11 of the Statement 
												of Claim which refers to the&quot; 
												afore-mentioned defendants, the 
												Itsekiri National Fund &quot;, and 
												contains an alternative averment 
												referring to the appellant as&quot; 
												agent of the said Itsekiri 
												National Fund &quot;. For my part, I 
												can see no real substance in the 
												point: they are merely averments 
												and could not have the effect of 
												turning an action against a 
												number of individuals jointly 
												and severally into one against 
												them in a representative 
												capacity. </span></p>

												The learned trial Judge did 
												misdirect himself in his 
												judgment where he states that 
												the appellant signed Exhibit &quot;

												Administrative Officer and that 
												the witness William Mowarin, a 
												qualified interpreter, gave 
												evidence that the contents of 
												the document were thoroughly 
												interpreted to the illiterate 
												signatories. That was done in 
												the case of Exhibit&quot; M &quot;, but 
												not in the case of Exhibit &quot; N 
												&quot;. I do not think, however, that 
												this misdirection could possibly 
												have influenced the conclusions 
												to which the trial Judge came. 
												In this connection, the question 
												the trial Judge had to determine 
												was whether the appellant 
												understood that trustees were 
												being appointed and a trust fund 
												created into which moneys 
												received on behalf of the family 
												were to be paid. In my view the 
												evidence is overwhelmingly in 
												favour of the conclusion that he 
												did. </span></p>

												The appellant attended the

												the meeting, Exhibit&quot; K &quot;, 
												discloses quite clearly that the 
												question of the appointment of 
												trustees, a committee of 
												management and the creation of a 
												trust fund were fully debated. 
												He signed Exhibit&quot; A &quot;, to which 
												I have already referred, 
												received the first payment of 
												£80, the receipt for which, 
												Exhibit&quot; SSS &quot;, is expressed to 
												be a receipt given by him to the 
												Treasurer-Trustee of the Omateye 
												Family Trust Fund; admitted in 
												evidence that the letter 
												demanding the next payment of 
												£80, written by his lawyer, 
												Exhibit&quot; T &quot;, was written 
												pursuant to Exhibit&quot; M &quot;, and it 
												is relevant to observe that the 
												first paragraph of the letter 
												reads: &quot; I have been consulted 
												by Chief Gbenebichie in regard 
												to the Omateye Family Trust 
												Fund&quot;; attended several meetings 
												of the Committee of Manage­ment 
												created as a result of the 
												family meeting held on 18th 
												October, 1947, and Exhibit&quot; M&quot;

												in evidence that he sent his &quot; 
												Notice of Withdrawal from the 
												Resolution dated 22.10.47 &quot;, 
												Exhibit&quot; U &quot;, because, </span>
												<i>

												was brought into being as a 
												result of an agreement reached 
												by the appellant and the leading 
												members of the Omateye family,

												In support of respondents'

												firstly, that the learned trial 
												Judge erred in law in 
												non-suiting the respondents'

												accepted, to establish the 
												liability of the appellant; and,

												proceedings &quot;. </span></p>

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As already indicated, there was, 
												in my view, a preponderance of 
												evidence in favour of the 
												respondents' case, and in view 
												of the fact that the defendants 
												in the action were sued jointly 
												and severally I am of the 
												opinion that the learned trial 
												Judge could, and should, have 
												given judgment in favour of the 
												respondents against the 
												appellant, for the amount 
												claimed. It follows, therefore, 
												that I take the view that no 
												amendment was, in fact, 
												necessary. Had it been 
												necessary. however, I am of the 
												opinion that the learned trial 
												Judge ought to have granted
												<font color="#FF0000">[pg 105]
												</font>it, even although it was 
												applied for after both Counsel 
												had completed their final 
												addresses to the Court. The 
												appellant admitted having 
												received the amount claimed and 
												the case was fought on the issue 
												as to his liability or otherwise 
												to pay the amount in question to 
												the respondents. In the 
												circumstances of this case an 
												amendment as to capacity could 
												not have worked any injustice on 
												the appellant, and if I had 
												considered an amendment 
												necessary I should have had no 
												hesitation in granting it here. 
												The principles upon which the 
												Court should act in a case such 
												as this are clearly set out in 
												the Lord Chancellor's judgment 
												in the unreported Privy Council 
												case of </span><i>

												If there was any capacity

												been non-suited, but the Court 
												ought to have allowed all the
