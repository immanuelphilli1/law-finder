												Possession had, on the 4th 
												March, 1950, been executed in

												1950, by which he was directed

												<font face="Arial">The Writ of 
												Possession in this case was 
												obtained by the respondents as a 
												result of their succeeding in 
												application brought by them 
												against the 'appellant in which 
												they claimed, in effect, for a 
												declaration that they were 
												entitled to possession, as 
												against him, of the Bortogina

												was delivered on the 24th April, 
												1948, and it was affirmed, on

												<font face="Arial">During the 
												hearing of the application for

												the appellant for a stay of 
												execution was also mentioned and 
												upon Mr. Larbi, on behalf of the 
												respondents, stating that he was 
												prepared to give an undertaking 
												that the respondents would not 
												take possession of any further 
												portion of the land, Mr. 
												Williams, for the appellant, 
												stated that he would accept the 
												undertaking and withdraw the 
												application for a stay of

												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 8.4pt; margin-left: 42.9pt; margin-right: .95pt">
												<font face="Arial">Before us it

												June, 1950, and that the

												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 8.4pt; margin-left: 42.9pt; margin-right: .95pt">
												<font face="Arial">The motion 
												calling upon the appellant to 
												show cause why he should not be 
												committed for contempt was filed 
												on 2nd September, 1950. The 
												hearing took place on various 
												dates between the 26th October, 
												1950 and 1st February, 1951. 
												and, as I have already 
												indicated, the learned trial

												<font face="Arial">In the Court

												was not at Bortogina on the 4th 
												.March, 1950, when it was 
												alleged that <i>the </i>Writ of 
												Possession was executed, and I 
												am of the opinion that this 
												dispute obscured the real issue 
												which the Court had to 
												determine. The evidence as to 
												his being present was 
												overwhelming and the learned 
												trial Judge so found. </font>
												</p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 8.4pt; margin-left: 42.9pt; margin-right: .95pt">
												<font face="Arial">A motion to

												</p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 8.4pt; margin-left: 42.9pt; margin-right: .95pt">
												<font face="Arial">Where an 
												alleged contempt arises from the 
												breach of an order made in 
												favour of a party, as is the 
												case here, it is a good answer 
												if it can be shown that the 
												party complaining of the 
												contempt has waived it, although 
												such a defence would not, of 
												course, avail a person charged 
												with criminal contempt. </font>
												</p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 8.4pt; margin-left: 42.9pt; margin-right: .95pt">
												<font face="Arial">In this case 
												it seems to me necessary that we 
												should carefully consider the 
												undertaking given by Me Larbi 
												upon the hearing of the 
												appellant's application. for 
												final leave to appeal to the 
												Judicial Committee, resulting, 
												as it did, in Mr. Williams 
												withdrawing his application for 
												a stay of execution. </font></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 8.4pt; margin-left: 42.9pt; margin-right: .95pt">
												<font face="Arial">While it is 
												true that Mr. Larbi said Writ of 
												Possession has 'been partially 
												executed, prepared to give 
												undertaking that respondents 
												will not take possession of any 
												further portions of the land &quot;, 
												it is also the case that the 
												Writ of Possession included the 
												whole area of the land in 
												dispute and the appellant and 
												the people he represented were 
												still in occupation of it. That 
												being so, although technically 
												the respondents had taken legal 
												possession of the land, they 
												were not in occupa­tion of any 
												of it, and I am of the opinion 
												that the appellant was entitled 
												to assume that the respondent 
												did not intend to take 
												possession in fact. In other 
												words that the respondents were 
												prepared to maintain the <i>
												status quo </i>until the result 
												of the appeal to the Judicial 
												Committee became known. The fact 
												that the respondent apparently 
												had no such intention docs not, 
												I think, affect the issue before 
												us. It is sufficient if a 
												reasonable man might have been 
												misled. </font></p>
												<p class="Style" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 8.4pt; margin-left: 42.9pt; margin-right: .95pt">
												<font face="Arial">It is true 
												that the writ of Possession was 
												executed on the 4th March, 1950, 
												and that the appellant ought to 
												have vacated the land forthwith, 
												but he and the others he 
												represents had lived on the land 
												in dispute over a long period of 
												years and it would, in my view 
												be right to allow' them a 
												reasonable period in which to 
												vacate the land before treating 
												him as being in contempt. 
												Moreover, he had obtained 
												conditional leave to appeal to 
												the Judicial Committee five days 
												before the Bailiff went on the 
												land and read the Writ of 
												Possession&quot; There is the further 
												fact that the appellant obtained 
												final leave to ap0tal to the 
												Judicial Committee on 22nd June, 
												1950, and the respondents,

												no further steps until the

												fact that the appellant has 
												repeatedly stated, both 
												personally and through his 
												Counsel, that he had no 
												intention of defying the order

												agree with the conclusion to

												appellant the sum of twenty-five 
												guineas paid by the latter to 
												the former in respect of the

												will result in both sides
