                                                appeal from a judgment of the 
                                                West African Court of Appeal 
                                                setting aside a judgment of the 
                                                Divisional Court sitting at Cape 
                                                Coast Castle. The action was one

                                                limited, the respondents in the 
                                                appeal, against a person who had 
                                                been employed as agent for them 
                                                for some years, based upon his 
                                                negligence in carrying out his 
                                                duties under a written contract, 
                                                dated 30th July, 1933, that is, 
                                                his breach of his contractual

                                                and it also was based to some 
                                                extent upon the fact that under 
                                                clause 3 of the written contract 
                                                he was responsible for any

                                                moneys received at the factory 
                                                of which he was in charge, due

                                                of it, or that he had embezzled 
                                                the money in any way, When the 
                                                case came on for trial before 
                                                the learned judge of first

                                                called who had been servants of 
                                                the branch of which the 
                                                defendant was in charge, one of 
                                                them being Henry Reginald Horner 
                                                Acquah and the other Thomas 
                                                Akyiremansa Carr; the first was 
                                                the cashier, and the second was 
                                                the book-keeper employed at the 
                                                branch in question, Both these 
                                                men were brought up in custody. 
                                                They were serving terms of 
                                                imprisonment, having been 
                                                convicted ultimately on their

                                                books of the branch and of other

                                                the defendant, it appeared that 
                                                each of them was desirous of 
                                                testifying that the moneys, or 
                                                the greater part of the moneys 
                                                in question, had been taken by 
                                                the defendant himself or had 
                                                been given to him by the witness 
                                                Acquah. Part of their evidence 
                                                Was proper and relevant, 
                                                evidence led to justify the 
                                                charge of negligence, but that 
                                                part. of their evidence which 
                                                suggested that the defendant had 
                                                himself taken the money was in 
                                                support of a charge which it was 
                                                not. open to the plaintiffs to 
                                                establish on the pleadings, and 
                                                indeed it amounted to a complete 
                                                change of the nature of the 
                                                cause of action which was open

                                                a defendant ought not to be made

                                                unless, in a case where there 
                                                are plead­ings, those charges 
                                                have been definitely and clearly 
                                                alleged, so that the defendant 
                                                comes into Court prepared to 
                                                meet them. Their Lordships must 
                                                express the opinion that the 
                                                learned judge was wrong in 
                                                allowing Acquah and Carr to 
                                                state in evidence that Taylor 
                                                had received these moneys or was 
                                                responsible for the 
                                                disappearance of the moneys by 
                                                way of fraud. So far as their 
                                                Lordships can gather from the 
                                                materials before them, the 
                                                counsel for the plaintiffs was 
                                                not responsible for the case 
                                                diverging in the way it did from 
                                                the case set out in the 
                                                pleadings, and it is very 
                                                noticeable that when the 
                                                defendant himself was called 
                                                into the box, although he 
                                                naturally was asked whether the 
                                                statements made by the two 
                                                persons who had given evidence 
                                                against him, Acquah and Carr, 
                                                were true, and although he 
                                                flatly denied their charges, 
                                                there was no endeavour on behalf 
                                                of the plaintiffs in any way ,to 
                                                cross-examine him with a view to 
                                                showing that he was guilty of 
                                                either fraud or felony or any 
                                                other criminal conduct 
                                                whatsoever. As far as their 
                                                Lordships can understand, the 
                                                Court was addressed on both 
                                                sides on the footing that a case 
                                                of negligence in the wide sense 
                                                was being made and that there 
                                                was no other case before the 
                                                Court. It is true that the 
                                                manager for the plaintiffs, Mr. 
                                                Bray, was recalled at the end of 
                                                the evidence by the judge 
                                                himself, and was asked by the 
                                                judge whether he believed the 
                                                evidence that Acquah and Carr 
                                                had given, and he said he did 
                                                and went on to say that the 
                                                plaintiffs asked the Court to 
                                                believe that evidence. In the 
                                                opinion of their Lordships it 
                                                was an error of judgment to have 
                                                asked Mr. Bray these questions 
                                                and to have attached any weight 
                                                to the answers to them. The 
                                                belief of Mr. Bray was 
                                                irrelevant from any point of 
                                                view; but apart from that no 
                                                case of fraud or felony was, 
                                                properly speaking, before the 
                                                Court. All that had happened was 
                                                that two witnesses, both serving 
                                                terms of imprisonment for crime, 
                                                had for some reason which it is 
                                                not necessary to go into thought 
                                                fit to say that their crimes had 
                                                been instigated by the defendant 
                                                in the action. The learned 
                                                judge, having come to the 
                                                conclusion that the two 
                                                witnesses, Acquah and Carr, were 
                                                telling the truth, thought it 
                                                was rig-ht. to take the view 
                                                that the action was an abuse of 
                                                the process of the Court and 
                                                that the alleged negligence was

                                                public policy for the judge to 
                                                say that the defendant, if he is 
                                                the man who is alleged to have 
                                                committed the felony, ought to 
                                                be prosecuted or a reasonable 
                                                excuse shown for his 
                                                non-prosecution; but there was

                                                case. The action was one which 
                                                was quite open to the plaintiffs

                                                fraud under the terms of the

                                                by the plaintiffs as the direct 
                                                result of the 'act' of the 
                                                defendant-would have been 
                                                sufficient to entitle the 
                                                plaintiffs to judgment, had 
                                                public justice been vindicated'. 
                                                I also agree and I consider the

                                                Court could possibly come to any 
                                                other conclusion. It is 
                                                abundantly clear that the 
                                                plaintiffs proved their case and 
                                                that, but for the point as to 
                                                non-prosecution being taken by 
                                                the Court, they would have been 
                                                given judgment in the Court 
                                                below. Now that reasonable 
                                                excuse for non-prosecution has 
                                                been shown, the plaintiffs are,

                                                West Africa for decision. The 
                                                case was heard to the end before 
                                                the trial judge and the whole of 
                                                the evidence seems to be before 
                                                their Lordships. With some 
                                                reluctance they have come to the 
                                                conclusion that they must 
                                                themselves decide whether the 
                                                existing evidence in the case is 
                                                sufficient to justify the 
                                                finding that a loss of £7,816 
                                                has been sustained by the 
                                                plaintiffs as the direct or 
                                                indirect result of the act, 
                                                neglect or default of the 
                                                defendant, or whether some less, 
                                                and if so what, loss has been 
                                                proved to have been so 
                                                occasioned. Owing to some 
                                                correspondence which took place 
                                                between the solicitors for the 
                                                two parties before the matter 
                                                was heard, their Lordships are 
                                                driven to the conclusion that it 
                                                would not be fair and just to 
                                                attempt to decide this matter 
                                                to-day, because there was 
                                                language in the correspondence 
                                                which passed between them which 
                                                led to the conclusion that the 
                                                amount due on the footing of 
                                                negligence alone was not to be 
                                                gone into. Their Lordships, 
                                                therefore, think it right in 
                                                order that they may be in a 
                                                position to decide the issue as 
                                                to quantum of damages for 
                                                negligence, to grant an 
                                                adjournment to enable any 
                                                necessary documents to be 
                                                printed or copied, and to enable 
                                                counsel to inform themselves as 
                                                to the relevant points which 
                                                alone remain for discussion when 
                                                the matter comes before this 
                                                Board again. Their Lordships 
                                                purposely say &quot;printed or 
                                                copied&quot;, because in the 
                                                circumstances they are desirous 
                                                that no large amount of cost 
                                                should be involved in the 
                                                matter. They think, so far as 
                                                they can form an opinion, that 
                                                with regard to a number of 
                                                documents all that will be 
                                                necessary will be a sample or 
                                                example of the document. in 
                                                question. They are quite content 
                                                that copies should be made and 
                                                duplicated by one of the 
                                                duplicating processes, and they 
                                                think that on that footing the 
                                                cost involved should not be 
                                                large. It is their Lordships' 
                                                suggestion, without making it a 
                                                part of the order, that the 
                                                respondents should deliver 
                                                particulars of the item&quot; in 
                                                respect of which as they allege 
                                                the evidence adduced at. the 
                                                trial proves that the loss was 
                                                occasioned by the act, neglect 
                                                or default of the defendant. If 
                                                that can be done, it seems to 
                                                their Lordships that it will 
                                                very greatly shorten the labours 
                                                of both sides, and the time that 
                                                will be occupied in discussing 
                                                the matter before the Board. 
                                                'their Lordships have anxiously 
                                                considered the question as to 
                                                whether they can in any way 
                                                interfere with what has been 
                                                described as the sequestration 
                                                order made on the application of 
                                                the appellant for leave to 
                                                appeal. In strictness, it is 
                                                not. a sequestration order, but 
                                                it has the effect, no doubt, of 
                                                making' it very difficult for 
                                                the appellant to deal with his 
                                                properties. Their Lordships are 
                                                unable to interfere with that 
                                                order; it is not clear that they 
                                                would have any right to do so, 
                                                but at any rate, in the 
                                                circumstances of the case they 
                                                do not think it possible to 
                                                interfere. On the other hand, 
                                                their Lordships think, having 
                                                regard to the fact that both 
                                                sides are to some extent 
                                                responsible for the unfortunate 
                                                position which has arisen, it 
                                                would be fair to direct that the 
                                                costs of copying or printing and 
                                                duplicating any docu­ments which
