                                              The functioning of society is 
                                              regulated by social norms, rules 
                                              and laws. The laws largely reflect 
                                              social practice. Such practice is 
                                              founded on producing the material 
                                              means of sustenance.&nbsp; Therefore 
                                              the economic structure that 
                                              emerges at any historically 
                                              determined stage of society's 
                                              development would produce laws in 
                                              its own image.&nbsp; The laws and the 
                                              economic structure are thus 
                                              interconnected, interrelated and 
                                              interdependent. They affect, 
                                              overlap, influence and dovetail 
                                              into each other. But as legal 
                                              expressions of property and other 
                                              social relations, the law stands 
                                              in a secondary relationship of 
                                              socio-economic activity.</span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
                                              <span style="font-family: Arial">
                                              That is what it should be; for 
                                              knowledge or cognitive activity is 
                                              based on the reflection of 
                                              concrete objective reality in the 
                                              consciousness of man. It involves 
                                              the conscious reproduction of the 
                                              object under study, its 
                                              properties, relations and 
                                              connections in its ideal form in 
                                              the consciousness of the observer. 
                                              A fortiori all objects, processes 
                                              and phenomena are primary in 
                                              relation to consciousness.&nbsp; That 
                                              is to say that consciousness is 
                                              secondary in relation to matter.
                                              </span></p>

                                              Ex hypothesi, the law must 
                                              necessarily reflect the concrete 
                                              objective reality of social 
                                              practice, ie socio-economic 
                                              activity.&nbsp; If we are right in this 
                                              view, then Roscoe Pound's 
                                              conception of the law as a tool of 
                                              social engineering could not be 
                                              accurate if the underlying 
                                              assumption of his thesis is that 
                                              the law can, by itself, bring 
                                              about social and economic 
                                              progress.&nbsp; That would be a 
                                              travesty of the true position—a 
                                              metaphysical abstraction of 
                                              reality. The law as a reflection 
                                              of social practice plays a 
                                              promotional role.&nbsp; It gives 
                                              impetus to socio-economic activity 
                                              by liberating and removing all the 
                                              legal impediments to social and 
                                              economic progress.&nbsp; At that level 
                                              of society's development where it 
                                              ceases to mirror social practice 
                                              and thus becomes a letter or a 
                                              clog on further development, new 
                                              laws are required to repeal those 
                                              which have become outmoded. The 
                                              new law then reflects the new 
                                              economic trends and structures, 
                                              thus giving a fillip to 
                                              development.&nbsp; In this sense, the 
                                              law must follow social practice as 
                                              does equity, the law.</span></p>

                                              One of the controversial themes in 
                                              the customary law of Ghana is the 
                                              alleged unaccountability of 
                                              certain persons under the 
                                              indigenous law. It is thus a 
                                              well-known customary principle 
                                              that the main benefit conferred on 
                                              a pledgee under the indigenous 
                                              pledge system is the right to 
                                              exploit the land, the subject of 
                                              the pledge, and enjoy its profits 
                                              without accounting for it. In

                                              principle to specific cases in the 
                                              adjudicative processes of the 
                                              courts, some of the judges would 
                                              seem to conceive of the law in 
                                              metaphysical terms by ignoring the 
                                              social norms and practices of 
                                              which the principle is reflective. 
                                              The principle is often treated in 
                                              its application as if it is an a 
                                              priori proposition existing 
                                              eternally, that is as a category

                                              the socio-economic activity that 
                                              should determine its form, essence

                                              the farm after thirteen years. 
                                              After four years, the appellant 
                                              sought to redeem the mortgage. 
                                              During those four years the 
                                              respondent had made profit of 
                                              between £20 and £60 per annum from

                                              overlooked that in pre-colonial

                                              within the family was

                                              levels. Before the introduction of

                                              cultivation of the soil, land 
                                              values were not high. Even at the 
                                              early periods of European contacts 
                                              and the establishment of

                                              hinterland remained largely 
                                              unaffected by those influences. 
                                              Moreover, the effect of the 
                                              Trans-Atlantic slave trade had not 
                                              only disrupted economic and social

                                              countryside in West Africa.4 This 
                                              made the population to land area

                                              possession was the fruit of his

                                              of large surpluses difficult and 
                                              almost impossible.&nbsp; These material 
                                              conditions were responsible for 
                                              the customary practice whereby the 
                                              pledgor would deliver possession 
                                              to another in return for a loan 
                                              with a right in the pledgee to

                                              calls &quot;old style customary law

                                              land was usually the subject - 
                                              matter of the pledge, the question 
                                              would have been answered in the 
                                              negative without much problem. But 
                                              the problem posed by the question 
                                              is made more complicated by the 
                                              fact that in this case&nbsp; the 
                                              pledgor had planted on the land 
                                              economic trees, a product of his 
                                              own labour.&nbsp; The annual tribute 
                                              was £9, while the annual yield 
                                              from the palm trees was £12, an 
                                              annual gain of £3.&nbsp; The harvesting 
                                              of the palm fruits went on for 30 
                                              years amounting to £360, exceeding 
                                              the original loan by £20.&nbsp; The 
                                              payment of the tribute for which 
                                              the loan was secured had ceased 
                                              altogether. These factors 
                                              introduced new elements not within 
                                              the contemplation of the old style 
                                              customary pledge out of which the 
                                              customary law evolved.</span></p>

                                              Smith CJ said that whenever palm 
                                              trees were given in pledge to 
                                              secure a loan, the amount of 
                                              produce realised from the trees 
                                              should be taken into account and 
                                              some portion of it set aside each 
                                              year against the original debt

                                              the loan was liquidated in this 
                                              way, the pledgor and his 
                                              successors could resume possession 
                                              of the farms.&nbsp; The Chief Justice 
                                              regarded it as &quot;unjust and 
                                              inequitable and opposed to natural

                                              the pledgee should continue

                                              should be paid. For, under the

                                              Justice thought the pledgee might

                                              presents similar problems.&nbsp; The 
                                              plaintiff secured a loan of £35 
                                              from the defendant and pledged his 
                                              shop as security for the loan.&nbsp; 
                                              The pledgee took possession of the 
                                              shop and let it out to a tailor. 
                                              The pledgor sought to redeem the 
                                              shop and claimed an account of the 
                                              rents collected by the defendant 
                                              since October 1952.&nbsp; The trial 
                                              judge acceded to the plaintiff's

                                              which was the subject-matter of 
                                              the transaction.&nbsp; Under an old 
                                              style pledge, the pledgee 
                                              developed the land creating wealth

                                              It is therefore arguable that the

                                              sufficient return on his capital. 
                                              Indeed, he may not as a matter of

                                              the pledgor is nevertheless 
                                              compelled to repay the amount 
                                              which represents a reasonable 
                                              return, then, what equity has the

                                              he thinks that more than

                                              All students of the customary law 
                                              are familiar with the rule that 
                                              the head of family is not liable 
                                              to render accounts to members of 
                                              the family; a rule supposedly 
                                              established in Abude v Onano24 and 
                                              which is claimed to be based on 
                                              the interpretation of Sarbah's 
                                              statement of the law in 1894.25 
                                              The rule is perhaps the most 
                                              criticised aspect of the customary 
                                              law.&nbsp; Few modern commentators on 
                                              the subject have anything to 
                                              commend it.26 But when the 
                                              opportunity was presented in

                                              rule, it was frustrated by the

                                              One of the key issues for 
                                              determination was whether or not 
                                              the trial judge was right in his

                                              three to two, held, inter alia, 
                                              that the customary rule that a 
                                              head of family was not accountable 
                                              in court to the suit of a member 
                                              of the family, whether a principal

                                              still held the status of a head 
                                              was reasonable and justifiable 
                                              because the head should have the 
                                              capacity to handle the routine

                                              at a family meeting for his 
                                              stewardship.&nbsp; Consequently, a

                                              In coming to that conclusion, the 
                                              majority of the Supreme Court 
                                              rejected the more progressive 
                                              dissenting views canvassed by 
                                              Apaloo CJ and Taylor JSC. In the 
                                              opinion of the former, the Supreme 
                                              Court ought to decline clearly to 
                                              follow the Pappoe v Kweku30 and 
                                              Abude v Onano line of cases31 
                                              because the customary rule laid 
                                              down by them was productive of 
                                              injustice and provided a potent 
                                              shield for the breach of fiduciary 
                                              duties.&nbsp; His view is that the law 
                                              must adapt itself to changing 
                                              social conditions and those 
                                              precedents are inapplicable to 
                                              modern conditions. To do otherwise 
                                              would be an exhibition of judicial 
                                              inertia wholly indefensible in our 
                                              day and age.&nbsp; The latter supported 
                                              him ably in these views.&nbsp; 
                                              According to Taylor's dissenting 
                                              opinion, the operation of such a 
                                              rule would be incompatible with 
                                              national aspirations inherent in 
                                              the need to infuse probity and 
                                              accountability into the public and 
                                              private lives of the populace as 
                                              well as the necessity to 
                                              discourage corrupt practices and 
                                              the abuse of power, whether 
                                              discretionary or mandatory, as 
                                              would seem to be prescribed by 
                                              sections 1(1)(c) and 61 of the

                                              Unlike the minority views, the 
                                              majority opinions overlooked the 
                                              fundamental question of the 
                                              relationship between the dynamic 
                                              customary practices of the people 
                                              and the development of the law, ie

                                              interdependence and their

                                              essence and content of the law.&nbsp; 
                                              Some of our judges fail to take 
                                              account of the fact that in modern 
                                              times the concept of accounting in 
                                              the formal sense imports highly 
                                              organised and complex social 
                                              system of production such as that 
                                              towards which our society is 
                                              making progress.&nbsp; Keeping records 
                                              of account is known to the 
                                              socio-economic formations that 
                                              preceded the capitalist system.&nbsp; 
                                              But it was during the industrial 
                                              revolution in Europe that 
                                              accounting as an economic and 
                                              legal concept attained maturity 
                                              reflecting the higher and more 
                                              complex nature of capitalist 
                                              production and services than those 
                                              that preceded it.&nbsp; A system of 
                                              accounting is a necessary 
                                              condition for businessmen whose 
                                              existence depends on the 
                                              maximization of profit.&nbsp; The 
                                              record of receipts and expenditure 
                                              is essential for determining 
                                              business prospects and attainable 
                                              profit margins.&nbsp; It also helps in 
                                              projecting into the future 
                                              decisions regarding future 
                                              investment policy objectives.&nbsp; 
                                              There can be no doubt that the 
                                              social system of production in the 
                                              closing years of the twentieth 
                                              century is capable of 
                                              accommodating that kind of 
                                              development. That is why social 
                                              practice in this modern day and 
                                              age requires accountability.</span></p>

                                              African traditional societies of 
                                              Sarbah's day were, however, 
                                              organised on the family or kinship 
                                              principles of sharing on community 
                                              membership basis. Communal 
                                              ownership of the land, the basic 
                                              means of production, was central 
                                              to such an economic system. Under 
                                              such an economic system, one 
                                              cannot expect the evolution of a 
                                              formal accounting system as an 
                                              economic category. Moreover, the 
                                              written word is a necessary 
                                              condition for that level of 
                                              sophistication in recording 
                                              accounts. Yet in 1894 when Sarbah 
                                              published his research findings, 
                                              writing could hardly have been 
                                              known in Fanti rural communities 
                                              that were organised on the family 
                                              principles of sharing under a 
                                              dominant communally organised

                                              Therefore when Sarbah's work is 
                                              relied upon today as the basis for 
                                              the proposition that under the 
                                              indigenous land the head of the 
                                              family cannot be sued for an 
                                              account, that could only be a 
                                              statement reflecting social norms 
                                              and practice in Sarbah's time. The 
                                              application of such a rule in our 
                                              society today would constitute a 
                                              recipe for open conflict. The 
                                              rationale for the Supreme Court's 
                                              decision would seem to be the need 
                                              to protect the dignity and the 
                                              integrity of the family head as 
                                              the &quot;fountain of honour.&quot; Yet a 
                                              suit against the family head for 
                                              an account brings into question 
                                              his integrity and honour. That is 
                                              why the court, as the independent 
                                              arbiter, would seem to be the best 
                                              institution apt to restore that 
                                              dignity when a clean account is

                                              influence of western education and 
                                              its capitalist ordering of 
                                              society. The legislature on the

                                              the last twenty years or so 
                                              responded positively to these

                                              intervene so as to restore the 
                                              balance between social practice 
                                              and the law. The result is the 
                                              enactment of the Head of Family 
                                              (Accountability) Law, 1985.34 It 
                                              should be pointed out that it is 
                                              not the law which introduced 
                                              formal accounting as an economic 
                                              and legal concept. It is the 
                                              result of social practice of 
                                              producing the material means of 
                                              sustenance. The law's response to 
                                              this is to recognise that fact and 
                                              to adapt itself to it.</span></p>

                                              out that it is not the law which 
                                              introduced formal accounting as an 
                                              economic and legal concept.&nbsp; It 
                                              came about as a result of social 
                                              practice of producing the material 
                                              means of sustenance. The law's 
                                              response to this phenomenon is to 
                                              recognise that fact and adapt 
                                              itself to it. When we turn to

                                              capitalist sector, we find these 
                                              examples of conflicts between 
                                              pristine customary law reflecting

                                              the forts along the coast. For 
                                              reasons of insecurity, inland 
                                              penetration was kept to the barest 
                                              minimum. The frequent internal 
                                              wars, sometimes encouraged by the 
                                              slave trade, prevented Europeans 
                                              from taking the risk of investing 
                                              in mineral exploitation. This 
                                              meant that the production of gold 
                                              and other precious minerals to 
                                              support such a large volume of 
                                              trade for so long a period was 
                                              controlled by the indigenous 
                                              people until the last decade of 
                                              the nineteenth century.39</span></p>

                                              Indigenous mining technology had 
                                              developed to appreciable levels.&nbsp; 
                                              Gold was mined and refined into 
                                              fine qualities. Division of labour 
                                              in the precious metal industry was 
                                              underscored by the development of 
                                              the jewellery industry in which 
                                              blacksmiths featured prominently 
                                              in the manufacture of gold 
                                              ornaments.&nbsp; Thus when the 
                                              Portuguese arrived in 1471, they 
                                              met the chief of Cape Coast 
                                              wearing a golden necklace.40 The 
                                              high level of skills developed in 
                                              the mining industry was 
                                              underscored by the large volume of 
                                              supplies. In 1554 for example, 
                                              Captain Thomas Winham, the first 
                                              Englishman to visit the Gold Coast 
                                              returned to England with 150 lbs 
                                              of gold dust.41 This could be seen 
                                              as the beginning of more than four 
                                              centuries of trade in gold and 
                                              other products between the United 
                                              Kingdom and the Gold Coast. We 
                                              thus find the editor of the 
                                              African Times reporting in 1880 
                                              that the mines of the Gold Coast 
                                              had been the source of supply of 
                                              gold for many years and were among 
                                              the most productive in the 
                                              world.42 The assessment of their 
                                              richness was based on the fact 
                                              that &quot;gold of the value of several 
                                              millions of pounds sterling&quot; 
                                              exported from the ports of the

                                              surface washing of the metal or 
                                              the crude crushing of gold-bearing 
                                              quartz carried on by the &quot;hands of 
                                              the Natives.&quot;43 It should be 
                                              pointed out, however, that 
                                              indigenous skills in the field 
                                              went far beyond the mere surface 
                                              washing of the metal.&nbsp; As the 
                                              paper itself had reported, 
                                              &quot;lacking in scientific skills and 
                                              mechanical appliances, the natives 
                                              had been unable to work below 70 
                                              or 80 feet from that depth.&quot;</span></p>

                                              This implied that they worked up 
                                              to at least 80 feet of depths.&nbsp; 
                                              Indeed the indigenous miners had, 
                                              before the European firms took 
                                              over from them and reduced them 
                                              into labourers, identified the 
                                              most suitable logs for props in 
                                              the mines. Due to its strength and 
                                              durability, the species &quot;Kaku&quot; or 
                                              &quot;fillacopsis kaku&quot;&nbsp; was identified 
                                              and successfully used for that 
                                              purpose. Thus when European miners 
                                              arrived, they adopted similar 
                                              technology. If such levels of 
                                              skills and technology were 
                                              attained before the direct 
                                              involvement of foreign miners, 
                                              what destroyed the indigenous 
                                              mining industry? That is the 
                                              subject to which we should turn 
                                              our attention.</span></p>

                                              Since the transition from the 
                                              medieval to modern times in the 
                                              fourteenth and fifteenth 
                                              centuries, status had gradually 
                                              ceased to be the basis for 
                                              organising economic and social 
                                              life in England. In its place 
                                              developed the law of contract. The 
                                              theoretical, philosophical, and 
                                              the ideological foundations of 
                                              that law were the laissez-faire

                                              competition. It was assumed under 
                                              such ideology that parties to a 
                                              transaction stood on an equal 
                                              bargaining position; and, as it

                                              conclusion of a valid contract, 
                                              either party must look out for 
                                              himself. The maxim is caveat 
                                              emptor. This meant that if a party 
                                              bought an ornament made of brass 
                                              in the mistaken belief that it was 
                                              made of gold while it was not, 
                                              unless the other party had

                                              purchaser was bound by the 
                                              transaction. That was the form,

                                              The effect on the mining rights of 
                                              the indigenous people of the

                                              reception of Anglo-American 
                                              conceptions of tenure and the 
                                              increasing use of their forms and 
                                              techniques of conveyancing in land 
                                              transactions in the traditional 
                                              schema was amply demonstrated by a 
                                              Tarkwa case.&nbsp; In 1888, the chief, 
                                              Kofi Chay, having granted a large 
                                              tract of his stool land to 
                                              Essamang Mining Co, allowed his 
                                              subjects to continue digging gold 
                                              on the land, apparently in genuine 
                                              belief that his subjects still had 
                                              the right to do so.&nbsp; The company 
                                              would most probably have succeeded 
                                              at the regular courts in the 
                                              ensuing action for trespass and 
                                              damages in the sum of £3,000, but 
                                              for the intervention of the 
                                              Governor. The latter intervened on

                                              grant was so one-sided and 
                                              unreasonable that the legal action

                                              speculation.49 As David Kible has 
                                              pointed out, enterprising groups

                                              &quot;source of annoyance to the tidy

                                              Indeed, most of the transactions 
                                              might be perceived by the 
                                              indigenous people as unjust. 
                                              However, there is a direct link 
                                              between the caveat emptor maxim 
                                              under which parties are supposed 
                                              to look up for themselves and the 
                                              doctrine of consideration. Under 
                                              the common law, consideration need 
                                              not be adequate. Hence, if from 
                                              the outward manifestation of the 
                                              parties' intent an agreement could 
                                              be seen to have been reached, the 
                                              parties are held to be&nbsp; bound no 
                                              matter how inadequate the 
                                              consideration might seem to the&nbsp; 
                                              observer.&nbsp; A classic operation of 
                                              this rule was exemplified in the 
                                              negotiation of the Adansi and 
                                              Bekwai concessions which became 
                                              known as the Ashanti Goldfields 
                                              Corporation.&nbsp; The consideration 
                                              for the 100 square miles of

                                              The chiefs' misfortune of 
                                              illiteracy thus became a 
                                              contractual fortune for the 
                                              concessionaire.&nbsp; A chief who 
                                              granted a concession over a 
                                              stretch of land subsequently 
                                              discovered that he ran the risk of

                                              It should be noted that in most of 
                                              the transactions, the 
                                              grantor-chiefs were referred to as 
                                              owners.&nbsp; Surely, under the 
                                              customary schema, the chiefs were 
                                              mere administrators and not owners 
                                              with exclusive dispositive 
                                              rights.&nbsp; It is the stool, the

                                              social group or community, in

                                              Therefore the operative effect of

                                              concessions that could be acquired

                                              The position of the indigenous 
                                              miners was aggravated by the 
                                              introduction of the Gold Mining 
                                              Products Protection Ordinance, 
                                              apparently intended to protect 
                                              concessionaires, rights to gold 
                                              mining products.58 No person shall

                                              mine gold was usurped, the 
                                              jewellery and ornaments industry

                                              undermined.&nbsp; Having been reduced

                                              miners sometimes pay agreed sums 
                                              of monthly allowances to security 
                                              personnel assigned the 
                                              responsibility of checking &quot;galamsay.&quot; 
                                              At any time they fail to honour 
                                              their &quot;obligation&quot;, raid 
                                              operations are carried against 
                                              them and their winnings either 
                                              seized or shared 
                                              disproportionately in favour of 
                                              their captors.65 Under such 
                                              conditions, it does not matter 
                                              whether or not it is the security 
                                              agencies or the &quot;galamsay&quot; miners 
                                              that retain the gold.&nbsp; It finds 
                                              its way outside the country. 
                                              Indeed, there are acknowledged 
                                              dealers in mining products in each 
                                              mining area in the country.&nbsp; They 
                                              buy the minerals from the diggers 
                                              and smuggle them out to be sold in

                                              This is a tragedy for the local 
                                              miners and the country.&nbsp; As the 
                                              business is illegally carried on, 
                                              winnings can only be sold in the 
                                              black market.&nbsp; More often than 
                                              not, the buyers of the gold and 
                                              other precious metals won by the &quot;galamsay&quot; 
                                              miners are the well-established 
                                              illegal dealers and smugglers. 
                                              They are also the financiers of 
                                              the former. Therefore in that 
                                              clandestine, restricted market, 
                                              the dealers are in the position to 
                                              dictate the price as the miners 
                                              stand in a weak bargaining 
                                              position.&nbsp; Under such conditions, 
                                              they become subjects of 
                                              unconscionable exploitation by 
                                              their financiers despite the 
                                              hazardous nature of the industry. 
                                              The real tragedy of this 
                                              phenomenon lies in the fact that 
                                              the dealers who are often aliens 
                                              or having alien connections, 
                                              smuggle their haul to be sold in 
                                              their countries of origin or 
                                              elsewhere in the world.&nbsp; There, 
                                              like the &quot;galamsay&quot; miners, the 
                                              gold is sold below the prevailing 
                                              world market prices.&nbsp; In the 
                                              process, therefore, Ghanaian 
                                              labour is cheaply employed for the 
                                              exploitation and carrying away of 
                                              a large proportion of the 
                                              country's mineral resources to 
                                              enrich other countries over the 
                                              last hundred years or so.</span></p>

                                              It is clear from this provision 
                                              that provided the Secretary

                                              to acquire a mining licence. It 
                                              should be pointed out, however, 
                                              that the material conditions which 
                                              have frustrated the development of 
                                              the indigenous mining industry 
                                              over the years remain unchanged. 
                                              It should be noted that by 1895, 
                                              almost all the fertile mining 
                                              areas from which the indigenous 
                                              people were operating had been 
                                              acquired by European firms and 
                                              their local educated 
                                              intermediaries. What remained had 
                                              been subsequently acquired in the 
                                              manner referred to earlier.&nbsp; The 
                                              present legislative measures could 
                                              thus be seen as closing the stable 
                                              door after the horse has escaped.&nbsp; 
                                              It is therefore not surprising 
                                              that currently, the &quot;galamsay&quot; 
                                              mining is largely carried on in 
                                              already acquired areas despite the 
                                              great risks involved in the 
                                              exercise. What is more, in present 
                                              day conditions, small-scale mining 
                                              is an expensive business. Apart 
                                              from the time-consuming and 
                                              expensive procedures to be gone 
                                              through before the acquisition of 
                                              a licence, the prospective miner 
                                              is expected to build platforms, 
                                              sink new wells to the depths 
                                              limited by the law and provide 
                                              other tools and infrastructure.</span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

                                              These are material conditions 
                                              which the law per se cannot 
                                              improve. It requires practical 
                                              policies and measures directed at 
                                              removing the constraints. It 
                                              should be pointed out that the 
                                              present enactments both in their 
                                              form and content are substantially 
                                              the same as their predecessors. 
                                              Indeed, there had never been any 
                                              law expressly proscribing mining 
                                              by the indigenous people. It was 
                                              the conditions that had to be 
                                              fulfilled, particularly formal

                                              However, one could see two 
                                              significant differences under the 
                                              present legislative measures. 
                                              First, it has paved the way for 
                                              legalising a socio-economic 
                                              practice that was before their 
                                              enactment illegal. Secondly, it 
                                              enables those who manage to obtain 
                                              the prescribed licences to sell 
                                              their products in the open market. 
                                              It also affords those who are 
                                              unable to obtain it the 
                                              opportunity to sell to those 
                                              acquiring such licences, what has 
                                              been mined under &quot;galamsay&quot; 
                                              conditions. This is a very 
                                              important development.</span></p>

                                              attributed largely to the

                                              1680 and 1700, over 300,000 slaves

                                              eighteenth century, the annual 
                                              export amounted to 74,000 of whom 
                                              possibly about half came from the

                                              op cit, 155. It would appear that 
                                              the learned Chief Justice 
                                              over-simplified the issues. Within 
                                              30 years, the pledgee could only 
                                              have made £360 based on the £12 
                                              annual profit.&nbsp; This means that he 
                                              obtained £20 over and above the 
                                              loan in 30 years. What the CJ did 
                                              not take into account was the 
                                              labour expended by the pledgor to 
                                              harvest, sell and distribute and 
                                              clear and maintain the farm. This 
                                              is where an order for account 
                                              becomes necessary if justice 
                                              should be done. The important 
                                              point, however, is that, this case 
                                              departed from the pristine 
                                              customary law.</span></p>
