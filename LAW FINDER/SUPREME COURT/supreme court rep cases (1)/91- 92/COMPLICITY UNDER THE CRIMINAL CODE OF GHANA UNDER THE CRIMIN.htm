                                              Complicity describes the mental 
                                              state of being united with others 
                                              in the commission of a crime 
                                              coupled with acts or omissions 
                                              that further the commission of 
                                              that crime. The persons so united, 
                                              are known as &quot;confederates&quot; or 
                                              &quot;accomplices&quot;1 because they, inter 
                                              alia, share the state of mind of 
                                              the principal offender and, 
                                              consequently, the criminal 
                                              liability.&nbsp; Owing, however, to the 
                                              fact that they are not the 
                                              principal actors during the 
                                              commission of the crime, their 
                                              liability is subject to special 
                                              rules at common law. These common 
                                              law rules, with some 
                                              modifications, have been codified 
                                              under the Ghana Criminal Code, 
                                              1960 (Act 29).2 The law on 
                                              complicity under Act 29 appears to 
                                              be almost taken for granted as 
                                              there is very little to be found 
                                              on the subject in the law 
                                              reports.&nbsp; Even in cases where 
                                              there are issues of complicity, 
                                              these issues are rarely discussed 
                                              as everybody takes it for granted 
                                              that who an accomplice is in any 
                                              given situation, is too obvious to 
                                              require discussion.&nbsp; Hence the 
                                              virile debates on the subject in 
                                              other jurisdictions have generated 
                                              little or no interest in ours.3</span></p>

                                              The apparent lack of interest in 
                                              the subject may have been caused 
                                              by a combination of two related 
                                              factors, namely either an improper 
                                              appreciation of the scope of the 
                                              law on complicity leading to a 
                                              very low rate of prosecution of 
                                              accomplices; or, a dearth of 
                                              appeals from lower court decisions 
                                              on the subject. Even in those 
                                              cases in which issues of 
                                              complicity are raised, the 
                                              discussion, is often confined to a 
                                              specific context; the usual 
                                              context being one in which the 
                                              merits of the appeal of a 
                                              principal offender depended upon 
                                              whether or not sufficient 
                                              complicity of the witness was 
                                              established to warrant the 
                                              evidentiary requirement of 
                                              corroboration. For these reasons, 
                                              there has been very little 
                                              discussion of the substance of the 
                                              provisions of Act. 29 on the 
                                              subject. It would seem, however, 
                                              that there are questions from our 
                                              own jurisdiction which are as 
                                              interesting as the issues being 
                                              discussed elsewhere.</span></p>

                                              The purpose of this article is to 
                                              analyse the Ghanaian law on the 
                                              subject with a view to increasing 
                                              the appreciation of members of the 
                                              profession of the material aspects 
                                              of the offence. This would in turn 
                                              increase the use of the provisions 
                                              of Act 29 on complicity in

                                              discussion of the subject involves 
                                              principally two sections of Act 
                                              29, namely sections 20 and 21. 
                                              Section 20 deals with the modes of 
                                              participation in crime.&nbsp; These are 
                                              described by the single word 
                                              &quot;Abetment.&quot; The provision also 
                                              deals with the manner in which an 
                                              abettor may be tried and punished, 
                                              as well as jurisdictional issues.&nbsp; 
                                              Section 21 deals with situations 
                                              where a different crime from that 
                                              which was abetted takes place, as 
                                              well as other issues of joint 
                                              enterprise. The discussion of 
                                              these provisions is carried out by 
                                              seeking assistance from other 
                                              common law jurisdictions that have 
                                              attempted to deal with problems 
                                              relating to accessorial liability.</span></p>

                                              anyway, the person contributes 
                                              nothing towards making the

                                              sense in which imposing liability 
                                              for the offence is unfair. Thus, 
                                              under Act 29, the act complained 
                                              of must precede or be

                                              commission of the crime. This 
                                              point was taken up and discussed 
                                              in Commissioner of Police v Sarpey 
                                              and Nyamekye.8&nbsp; The case involved 
                                              a policeman who had allowed a 
                                              lorry with stolen goods to pass by 
                                              him unchecked. His conviction for 
                                              the abetment of stealing was 
                                              quashed because the court was of 
                                              the opinion that at the time the 
                                              appellant became involved, the 
                                              stealing had already taken place.&nbsp; 
                                              The act of the appellant had in no 
                                              way enabled the stealing to 
                                              occur.&nbsp; The court therefore came 
                                              to the conclusion that under Act 
                                              29, all acts which constitute 
                                              abetment must be &quot;contemporaneous

                                              some merit, it does appear to 
                                              somewhat exaggerate the importance

                                              cursory look at the provision 
                                              would also indicate that the 
                                              meanings of some of those words 
                                              used in the catalogue of words 
                                              overlap. There is therefore the 
                                              temptation to treat them as 
                                              meaning one and the same thing. 
                                              Such temptation must be resisted. 
                                              The reasoning here is that if 
                                              Parliament in its wisdom thought 
                                              that all those words must be 
                                              included in the list of 
                                              activities, then there is a 
                                              presumption that they are intended 
                                              to mean different things. The 
                                              wisdom of this reasoning has also 
                                              been supported by Lord Widgery CJ,

                                              Parliament may have thought that 
                                              providing one word for all the

                                              this was the motive, they failed 
                                              because the need to prove what

                                              examining each of the words used 
                                              in Act 29, in order to determine 
                                              what Parliament meant to include 
                                              in this category of offence. An 
                                              examination of the words reveals 
                                              that some words indicate some 
                                              physical activity on the part of 
                                              the abettor during the commission 
                                              of the offence, whilst with 
                                              others, it is more a question of 
                                              &quot;remote control.&quot; Thus all the 
                                              activities which would have 
                                              rendered a person a principal in 
                                              the second degree or an accessory 
                                              before the fact in the old mode of 
                                              categorisation, come under the 
                                              omnibus term of &quot;Abetment.&quot;</span></p>

                                              It is consequently appropriate to 
                                              begin this undertaking with the 
                                              word “abet” itself. This word has 
                                              all the connotations of 
                                              &quot;assistance&quot; without conveying any 
                                              particular idea of what activity 
                                              it covers. As Glanville Williams 
                                              observes, it is &quot;... a useful 
                                              technical term for helping in the 
                                              commission of crime . . . but it 
                                              is poor for instructing juries, or 
                                              for a code.&quot;15 If judges in 
                                              England who are native speakers of 
                                              the English language have problems 
                                              explaining this word to other 
                                              native speakers, then the nature 
                                              of the problem in this country can 
                                              be better appreciated. In essence, 
                                              a Ghanaian judge who has to 
                                              explain this word to a Ghanaian 
                                              jury has two main problems: first, 
                                              effectively explaining what kinds 
                                              of assistance are covered by the 
                                              term; and secondly, doing so in 
                                              terms which would not indicate 
                                              that a verdict is being suggested 
                                              to the jury.</span></p>

                                              Giving meaning to the word is 
                                              rendered even more complicated by 
                                              the fact that there is no 
                                              consensus even in the community of 
                                              legal scholars as to what the word 
                                              means.&nbsp; Explaining the various 
                                              words used in the English Offences 
                                              Against the Person Act, 186116 in 
                                              terms of &quot;consensus&quot; and 
                                              &quot;causation&quot;, the learned authors 
                                              of an authoritative text on 
                                              criminal law state that &quot;abetment&quot; 
                                              implies consensus with the 
                                              principal offender, but no 
                                              causation.17 In other words, the 
                                              liability of the secondary party 
                                              lies in showing the criminal 
                                              mental state and communication 
                                              with the principal rather than in 
                                              acts that produce the event. A 
                                              Canadian judge also gave a 
                                              somewhat different definition to 
                                              the word. He held that &quot;To abet is 
                                              to be personally or constructively 
                                              present at the commission of an 
                                              offence and to assist in the 
                                              criminal act.18 Thus he implies 
                                              both consensus and causation, for 
                                              the abettor in the second 
                                              definition does more than simply 
                                              share the criminal mental element 
                                              that the offender has. Neither of 
                                              these meanings seems adequate 
                                              because they do not appear to 
                                              cover the situation in which the 
                                              abettor is actually the instigator 
                                              or the mastermind behind the 
                                              crime. What seems to be made clear 
                                              from the authorities as well as 
                                              these divergent views is that 
                                              &quot;abet&quot; is a word that conveys only 
                                              vague notions of complicity, but 
                                              no clear images.&nbsp; Indeed, it has 
                                              so often been used in conjunction 
                                              with &quot;aid&quot; that it has tended to 
                                              take its colour from that word. 
                                              This is obviously because &quot;aid&quot; is 
                                              so much easier to explain or even 
                                              to conceptualise. The vagueness of 
                                              the word, then, must account for 
                                              the long list of words giving form 
                                              and substance to it. The catalogue 
                                              of words reads as follows: 
                                              &quot;instigate&quot;; &quot;command&quot;; &quot;counsel&quot;; 
                                              &quot;procure&quot;; &quot;solicit&quot;; &quot;aid&quot;; 
                                              &quot;facilitate&quot;; &quot;encourage&quot;; 
                                              &quot;promote&quot;.</span></p>

                                              Our discussion of the several 
                                              activities that constitute 
                                              abetment would begin with 
                                              &quot;instigate&quot; only by reason of it 
                                              being the first on the list.&nbsp; At 
                                              common law, the preference seems 
                                              to be for its synonym, &quot;incite.&quot; 
                                              However, in Act 29, &quot;incite&quot; is 
                                              not used at all in the substantive 
                                              provision although it is used in 
                                              the illustration provided to 
                                              explain the application of the 
                                              provision.19 It would be 
                                              interesting to discover why it was 
                                              that Parliament preferred 
                                              &quot;instigate&quot; to &quot;incite&quot; and yet 
                                              could not abandon the latter term 
                                              completely. Whatever the reason, 
                                              the inconsistency of expression is 
                                              regrettable. For the present 
                                              purposes, however, this leads to 
                                              the conclusion that Parliament 
                                              intended the words to be used 
                                              interchangeably. For this reason, 
                                              the authorities cited are all on 
                                              &quot;incite&quot;, but are equally 
                                              applicable to &quot;instigate.&quot;</span></p>

                                              another's mind in the direction of 
                                              the commission of a crime.&nbsp;

                                              This is a very wide definition 
                                              indeed. It appears to cover all 
                                              forms of communication that can be 
                                              indulged in, in order to influence 
                                              the mind of another in the 
                                              direction of crime. As the 
                                              authorities point out, nothing 
                                              need be done by the person who is 
                                              the focus of the activity. Indeed, 
                                              it has been held that an agreement 
                                              to indemnify a person against any 
                                              fine that may be incurred in the 
                                              future on account of certain acts, 
                                              may be an act of incitement.22 The 
                                              reasoning of the court here may be 
                                              due to the fact that a person with 
                                              the assurance of such an indemnity 
                                              may read into it an invitation to 
                                              go ahead and commit the offence.&nbsp; 
                                              Thus there need be no evidence 
                                              that the person who was the object 
                                              of the incitement was influenced 
                                              one way or the other. It is 
                                              immaterial if the words had no 
                                              effect at all.23 For all material 
                                              purposes, it is the act of the one 
                                              who incites, rather than the 
                                              effect of the incitement on the 
                                              victim, which is the cause of the 
                                              censure. This offence is therefore 
                                              intended to rope in all manner of 
                                              activity that could be the genesis 
                                              of criminal activity.</span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

                                              Next is the word &quot;command.&quot; To 
                                              &quot;command&quot; is more easily 
                                              understood in terms of ordering an 
                                              activity to be carried out. In 
                                              that situation, the offender is 
                                              seen more as a tool than as a 
                                              willing participant. This is 
                                              because implicit in the 
                                              relationship of the commander and 
                                              commanded, is the presumption of 
                                              the superior status of the former 
                                              as against the latter, as well as 
                                              an obligation to obey. It could 
                                              hardly be said of co-equals that 
                                              one had &quot;commanded&quot; the other. 
                                              Hence, it would seem that a person 
                                              who commands bears more moral 
                                              responsibility than the one who is 
                                              commanded.24 In order for a person 
                                              to be guilty of &quot;commanding&quot;, it 
                                              would seem that nothing less than 
                                              a legal duty to obey would be 
                                              enough to establish that 
                                              relationship. This would therefore 
                                              exclude the 
                                              &quot;Your-wish-is-my-command&quot; kind of 
                                              situation which is a situation of 
                                              voluntary submission to the 
                                              authority of another, rather than 
                                              a legal obligation to submit. 
                                              Since the subject matter is the 
                                              commission of an offence, it would 
                                              seem that there is no room for a 
                                              &quot;moral obligation to obey.&quot; A 
                                              &quot;command&quot; must therefore proceed 
                                              from one with lawful authority 
                                              otherwise the act becomes one of 
                                              &quot;instigation.&quot;</span></p>

                                              &quot;Counsel&quot; immediately brings to 
                                              mind the giving of advice.&nbsp; This 
                                              is the ordinary meaning of the 
                                              word which is considered the one 
                                              most reasonable to adopt.25 Any 
                                              other construction would be 
                                              artificial. Thus advice given by 
                                              another which enables an offence 
                                              to be committed would qualify as 
                                              abetment even if it was the 
                                              offender who sought out the 
                                              advisor.&nbsp; It is however not enough 
                                              to establish criminal liability to 
                                              merely prove that the advice was 
                                              given. Unlike &quot;instigation&quot;, an 
                                              offence of a particular nature 
                                              must have been committed in 
                                              pursuance of that advice. As 
                                              Parker LJ explains, &quot;[T]he actual 
                                              offence must have been committed . 
                                              . . by the person counselled.&quot;26&nbsp; 
                                              To this end, there clearly must 
                                              first be contact between the 
                                              parties, and then such a 
                                              connection between the counselling 
                                              and the commission of the offence 
                                              that it would be impossible to 
                                              deny that the offence was 
                                              committed as a result of the 
                                              advice given.&nbsp; This means that a 
                                              person who gives advice to the 
                                              &quot;whole world&quot;, as in a television 
                                              broadcast, would not be guilty of 
                                              counselling, but of incitement.

                                              the crime committed was different 
                                              from that which was counselled. At 
                                              the most, this should be the case 
                                              only when the offence is so 
                                              radically different that there 
                                              could be no relationship at all 
                                              between them. Thus a person who 
                                              counsels rape by demonstrating how 
                                              tactically easy it would be, ought 
                                              not to escape blame if those 
                                              tactics were adopted not to rape, 
                                              but to rob.&nbsp; There is a lot to be 
                                              said for the law's attitude in 
                                              this regard because a different 
                                              attitude might result in otherwise 
                                              innocent people being linked to 
                                              crimes by force of circumstances. 
                                              However, in situations where the 
                                              person could not escape moral 
                                              opprobrium, it seems somewhat 
                                              irrational to adopt so technical 
                                              an interpretation that the purpose 
                                              of the law would be defeated.</span></p>

                                              To &quot;procure&quot; the commission of an 
                                              offence is also a specie of 
                                              abetment. What acts then would 
                                              come under its umbrella? In 
                                              general, one who &quot;procures&quot; the 
                                              commission of an offence is, in a 
                                              causal sense, the one who brings 
                                              about the mental state which 
                                              results in the commission of the 
                                              offence. In the words of one 
                                              commentator on the English Draft 
                                              Code:&nbsp; &quot;What the procurer brings 
                                              about or causes is a state of mind 
                                              on the part of the perpetrator, 
                                              leading him to perpetrate the 
                                              crime.:27 The point was 
                                              demonstrated in the English courts 
                                              when the Attorney-General referred 
                                              a case to the Court of Appeal for 
                                              a ruling because a person 
                                              prosecuted as an accessory to the 
                                              offence of driving under the 
                                              influence of alcohol, had been 
                                              acquitted. The facts leading to 
                                              that reference was that the 
                                              accused person had introduced 
                                              alcohol into the drink of a person 
                                              he knew would shortly be driving. 
                                              When the person was arrested and 
                                              charged, it transpired that it was 
                                              the act of the accused that had 
                                              caused the commission of the 
                                              offence. In consequence, the 
                                              accused was also charged with 
                                              abetment as having procured the 
                                              commission of the offence, but was 
                                              acquitted. Lord Widgery CJ, ruling 
                                              on the issue, held that the act 
                                              did indeed amount to procuring. He 
                                              explained that: &quot;[t]o procure 
                                              means to produce by endeavour. You 
                                              procure a thing by setting out to 
                                              see that it happens and taking 
                                              appropriate steps to produce that 
                                              happening.&quot;28 Thus one who gives 
                                              alcoholic drinks to another whom 
                                              he knows would be driving, abets 
                                              the offence of driving under the 
                                              influence of alcohol.</span></p>

                                              It has been suggested that 
                                              “procure” is “unhelpful and 
                                              misleading”29 and that a better 
                                              word would be “influence.” With 
                                              the greatest respect, it would 
                                              seem that “influence” does not go 
                                              far enough in conveying the full 
                                              meaning of &quot;procure.&quot; The very 
                                              essence of the word &quot;procure&quot; 
                                              indicates that a crime must have 
                                              been committed. It is thus a step 
                                              further than &quot;incite&quot; for it is 
                                              impossible to show that an offence 
                                              was &quot;procured&quot; unless there is 
                                              evidence that there was a 
                                              personality in the background 
                                              pulling the strings.&nbsp; The 
                                              possibility of the activity and 
                                              the offence must go beyond the 
                                              merely coincidental to evidence 
                                              that the activity was &quot;produce[d] 
                                              by endeavour.&quot; Thus, &quot;influence&quot; 
                                              does not convey the same sense of 
                                              purpose that &quot;procure&quot; conveys 
                                              and, in the opinion of the present 
                                              writer, is therefore an 
                                              inappropriate synonym. It seems 
                                              that Lord Widgery's meaning is 
                                              more in accord with the sense in 
                                              which the word is used under our 
                                              Act 29.</span></p>

                                              This does not mean that an act 
                                              that may be lawfully engaged in 
                                              would amount to &quot;procuring&quot;, even 
                                              though it could be foreseen that 
                                              the probable result of that 
                                              activity would be to tempt another 
                                              to commit an offence. This point 
                                              is made in Republic v Tema 
                                              District Magistrate Grade I; Ex 
                                              parte Akotiah.30&nbsp; In that case, 
                                              the applicants had been ordered to 
                                              appear before a magistrate to show 
                                              cause why they should not be made 
                                              to execute a bond to keep the 
                                              peace. The problems leading to 
                                              this order by the magistrate had 
                                              arisen because some persons had, 
                                              in exercise of their lawful right, 
                                              attempted to instal a chief at Ada. 
                                              Their political opponents, who 
                                              claimed to have already installed 
                                              one, brought an application before 
                                              the district magistrate to stop 
                                              the installation of the new chief. 
                                              They alleged that the acts of the 
                                              respondents would induce a breach 
                                              of the peace by their own 
                                              supporters. The magistrate upheld 
                                              this claim, and ordered those 
                                              persons to appear before him and 
                                              to show cause why the application 
                                              should not be granted. It was in 
                                              consequence of this order that the 
                                              instant application for certiorari 
                                              and prohibition was brought to

                                              In granting the application, the 
                                              court held that one could not be 
                                              guilty of procuring the commission 
                                              of an offence by embarking upon a 
                                              course of conduct which was 
                                              lawful, even though it would 
                                              induce a breach of the peace. The 
                                              court applied the English case of 
                                              Beatty v Gillbanks,31 a case which 
                                              involved the Salvation Army and 
                                              its opponents, the Skeleton Army, 
                                              in almost similar circumstances as 
                                              in the instant case.&nbsp; From these 
                                              authorities, the inevitable 
                                              conclusion is that the act which 
                                              &quot;procures&quot; the event should be one 
                                              that is not pursued in exercise of 
                                              one's legal rights.</span></p>

                                              pleading.&quot;32&nbsp; All these 
                                              definitions show one person

                                              down that other's moral

                                              advantage. In the case law, it has 
                                              also been explained to cover the 
                                              tempting of a person, or the 
                                              luring of another into evil.33&nbsp; 
                                              Therefore any act done would 
                                              constitute the offence of 
                                              soliciting, if a person’s 
                                              participation in a crime is

                                              state that those engaging in these 
                                              activities would in most cases not

                                              activities would just make the

                                              The next batch of words are of a 
                                              different genre. These words are 
                                              descriptive of certain activities. 
                                              They also indicate that one way or 
                                              the other, the activities would 
                                              have been done not only with the 
                                              purpose of assisting another to 
                                              commit a crime, but would also 
                                              have taken place during the 
                                              commission of the main crime.&nbsp; The 
                                              acts described are thus in the 
                                              nature of physical assistance 
                                              during the commission of an 
                                              offence, and would at common law 
                                              make a person liable as a 
                                              principal in the second degree.&nbsp; 
                                              Owing to the fact that these acts 
                                              are ordinarily harmless unless 
                                              done with that aim of rendering 
                                              assistance to a person engaged in 
                                              committing a crime, Act 29 uses 
                                              &quot;purposely” to describe their 
                                              actions. This insistence on 
                                              &quot;purpose&quot; is quite logical since a 
                                              person being unaware that the 
                                              commission of a crime is in 
                                              progress, cannot be accused of 
                                              rendering assistance that would 
                                              further that effort.&nbsp; The use of 
                                              that word therefore rules out 
                                              accidental presence, or acts done 
                                              without the requisite mens rea. 
                                              The distinction is made clearer by 
                                              considering the following example. 
                                              Two people are committing a 
                                              burglary whilst a third uses his 
                                              body to block the public view by 
                                              standing in the doorway.&nbsp; In 
                                              almost similar circumstances, two 
                                              people are committing a burglary 
                                              when it begins to rain.&nbsp; The rain 
                                              causes a passer-by without an 
                                              umbrella to take refuge under the 
                                              eaves, in the company of two 
                                              people the passer-by took to be 
                                              workmen.&nbsp; In so doing, the 
                                              passer-by's body blocks the view 
                                              of the public and so the burglary 
                                              is successfully committed and the 
                                              burglars escape.&nbsp; In the second 
                                              instance, it is quite clear that 
                                              although the result of the act was 
                                              the same as the first, the 
                                              presence of the third person was 
                                              entirely accidental.&nbsp; The same 
                                              cannot be said for the person in 
                                              the first instance.&nbsp; The 
                                              difference is that it was the mens 
                                              rea that defined the purpose and 
                                              which in turn dictated the course 
                                              of conduct appropriate for the 
                                              occasion.</span></p>

                                              The discussion of the words which 
                                              describe these activities begins 
                                              with the word &quot;aid&quot;.&nbsp; This word

                                              found in the authorities, but to

                                              To &quot;aid&quot; is to &quot;help&quot; another to 
                                              commit an offence. This was the 
                                              conclusion that the Privy Council 
                                              came to in Thambiah v R.34 This 
                                              was an appeal by a person who had 
                                              been convicted of &quot;aiding&quot; the 
                                              offence of forgery of cheques. The 
                                              appellant had opened a bank 
                                              account under a false name and 
                                              description. The account was later 
                                              used to dispose of forged 
                                              cheques.&nbsp; In dismissing the 
                                              appeal, the court held that the 
                                              conviction had been proper because 
                                              it was the act of the appellant 
                                              that set the stage for the 
                                              commission of the crime. One can 
                                              see clearly here that the 
                                              assistance rendered to the forgers 
                                              made it possible for the offence 
                                              to be committed.&nbsp; The dismissal of 
                                              the appeal meant that one could 
                                              &quot;aid&quot; without being physically 
                                              present. However, since the 
                                              provision of the bank account was 
                                              the necessary tool for the 
                                              completion of the offence, there 
                                              is a sense in which the accused 
                                              could be deemed to have been 
                                              present. From this, one can 
                                              conclude that although a principal 
                                              in the second degree is supposed 
                                              to be present during the 
                                              commission of the offence, 
                                              &quot;presence&quot; can be either physical 
                                              or constructive, depending upon 
                                              the nature of the offence. </span>

                                              The decision in National Coal 
                                              Board v Gamble35 lends credence to 
                                              this view. In that case, a truck 
                                              driver had been arrested for 
                                              driving an overloaded vehicle. The 
                                              load complained of was coal, which 
                                              had been bought from the premises 
                                              of the appellants. The official in 
                                              charge of the weighbridge had 
                                              noticed the overload and drawn the 
                                              driver's attention to it. The 
                                              driver had then said that he would 
                                              take the risk, and the official 
                                              who could have prevented him from 
                                              leaving the premises, handed him 
                                              the ticket which enabled him to do 
                                              so. On the facts, it was clear 
                                              that the servant of the appellants 
                                              enabled the driver to commit the 
                                              offence.&nbsp; The appellants were 
                                              therefore charged with aiding and 
                                              abetting the offence.&nbsp; The 
                                              majority of the court was of the 
                                              opinion that the appeal should 
                                              fail because &quot;[a] person who 
                                              supplies the instrument for a 
                                              crime or anything essential to its 
                                              commission aids in the commission 
                                              of it ... &quot;36&nbsp; It is thus clear 
                                              that a person who opens a bank 
                                              account to enable dishonest 
                                              activities to be carried on, would 
                                              definitely have supplied the 
                                              instrument essential to the 
                                              commission of a range of offences. 
                                              Since the opening of the account 
                                              had been done &quot;purposely&quot;, the 
                                              Code would also support this view 
                                              that such a person had aided the 
                                              commission of the offence.</span></p>

                                              To &quot;facilitate&quot; also means to 
                                              render assistance which makes the 
                                              commission of the offence easier 
                                              for the perpetrator.&nbsp; Thus, it has 
                                              been held that a person who buys 
                                              uncustomed goods facilitates the 
                                              commission of fraud on the 
                                              revenue-collection agencies.37 It 
                                              also seems to be the case that a 
                                              person who &quot;facilitates&quot; must do 
                                              more than remain passive.&nbsp; 
                                              Therefore a private individual who 
                                              sees a crime in progress and does 
                                              not report it, cannot be said to 
                                              have facilitated the commission 
                                              although the fact of not reporting 
                                              may have enabled the crime to be 
                                              completed. This was the holding in 
                                              Apetorgbor v The Republic38 in 
                                              which case a woman who was a

                                              report it was held not to be an 
                                              accomplice.</span></p>

                                              However, the same could not be 
                                              said for a law-enforcement 
                                              official who winks at a situation 
                                              and thereby enables a crime to be 
                                              committed. &nbsp;The kind of conduct in 
                                              contemplation must have gone 
                                              beyond mere indolence or 
                                              negligence to a purposeful act of 
                                              omission. For instance, a 
                                              policeman in uniform who, by his 
                                              presence at the scene of a crime, 
                                              wards off intruders by giving the 
                                              impression that it is a 
                                              police-supervised operation, would 
                                              definitely have facilitated the 
                                              commission of the crime. It is 
                                              equally true that a person whose 
                                              official duty it is to detect or 
                                              prevent the commission of crimes 
                                              may &quot;facilitate&quot; the commission of 
                                              a crime by doing nothing to 
                                              prevent it when the facts come to 
                                              his attention.</span></p>

                                              &quot;encouragement&quot; has given the

                                              approval.39 However a merely 
                                              curious spectator cannot be guilty 
                                              of &quot;encouraging&quot; without the

                                              her presence has the effect of 
                                              doing so.40 It is thus no offence 
                                              of abetment to stand by as a mere 
                                              passive spectator of a crime, even 
                                              of murder.41</span></p>

                                              where the court is required to 
                                              assess conduct which is capable of 
                                              being construed one way or the

                                              who accompanies a friend to 
                                              negotiate for a criminal abortion 
                                              although she utters no word of 
                                              encouragement nor takes any part 
                                              in the negotiation? Although in 
                                              Obeng v The Republic42 the Court 
                                              of Appeal by a majority decision 
                                              of Sowah and Lassey JJA (as they 
                                              then were) held that a woman who 
                                              accompanied a friend twice to 
                                              negotiate for an abortion was not 
                                              an accomplice to the crime of 
                                              illegal abortion, the law seems to 
                                              suggest otherwise.&nbsp; It is true 
                                              there was no evidence of any 
                                              activity beyond offering her 
                                              companionship to her friend as the 
                                              deal was being negotiated.&nbsp; All 
                                              the same, it is curious that the 
                                              majority refused to accept the 
                                              fact of her complicity when the 
                                              evidence showed that she at all 
                                              material times knew what her 
                                              friend desired to do and raised no 
                                              objection thereto. The dissenting 
                                              judgment of Azu Crabbe JA (as he 
                                              then was) puts more emphasis on 
                                              the fact of her voluntary presence 
                                              to hold that she was an 
                                              accomplice.&nbsp; Clearly, the majority 
                                              was wrong on this point because 
                                              the fact of her silence, coupled 
                                              with her non-accidental presence 
                                              on two occasions, rendered her act 
                                              an &quot;encouragement.&quot; </span></p>

                                              This case may be contrasted with

                                              accomplice because he had been

                                              led to the prosecution.&nbsp; The facts 
                                              were that a policeman nicknamed 
                                              &quot;Tiger&quot; was on patrol duty one

                                              room. His suspicions aroused, he 
                                              also went into that room.&nbsp; There, 
                                              he found the first and second 
                                              accused persons, as well as two

                                              subsequently made the second and 
                                              fourth prosecution witnesses

                                              looking very frightened.&nbsp; This 
                                              further deepened his suspicion and 
                                              he therefore proceeded to search 
                                              the room.&nbsp; This search produced 
                                              some police uniforms and other 
                                              accoutrements as well as a

                                              note.&nbsp; Consequent upon these 
                                              discoveries, all the occupants of 
                                              the room were placed under 
                                              arrest.&nbsp; Further police 
                                              investigations resulted in two of 
                                              the persons being released and 
                                              turned into prosecution 
                                              witnesses.&nbsp; During the trial, the 
                                              judge failed to warn the assessors 
                                              that those witnesses were 
                                              accomplices whose evidence 
                                              required corroboration.&nbsp; The 
                                              accused persons were subsequently 
                                              convicted and they brought the 
                                              instant appeal.&nbsp; The appeal was 
                                              allowed because the circumstances 
                                              were such that the witnesses were 
                                              particepts criminis.&nbsp; Crabbe JSC 
                                              was not in doubt that the parties 
                                              were accomplices even though they 
                                              were merely present in that room.&nbsp; 
                                              Their guilty looks suggested that 
                                              they knew what was afoot and it 
                                              was therefore unsafe to convict on 
                                              their evidence. This it is 
                                              submitted, is a correct 
                                              interpretation of the law because 
                                              an accomplice need not do anything 
                                              in particular. It is enough if the 
                                              person's presence is not a 
                                              coincidence, and he or she shares 
                                              the mens rea of the principal 
                                              offender. The existence of this 
                                              authority should therefore have 
                                              inferenced the decision in the

                                              wilfully encouraged and so aided 
                                              and abetted.&quot;</span></p>

                                              Willful encouragement then seems 
                                              to be the butt of this provision.&nbsp; 
                                              The person must know of the

                                              in a typical scene of a street 
                                              fight in Accra, it is not only 
                                              those who shout yii le45 or clap 
                                              their hands in encouragement to 
                                              the fighters, who are abettors. 
                                              Those who, supporting neither 
                                              side, give vent to their 
                                              excitement by uttering the now 
                                              famous Ga expression46 to cheer on 
                                              the fighters would be equally 
                                              guilty. However, those persons who 
                                              are drawn to the spot as a result 
                                              of the commotion and remain to see 
                                              the end of the business would be 
                                              regarded merely as curious 
                                              onlookers. The fact of their 
                                              presence per se would not be 
                                              considered an &quot;encouragement.&quot; 
                                              This is so although the 
                                              authorities hold that the 
                                              non-accidental presence of a 
                                              person at an illegal prize-fight 
                                              constitutes &quot;encouragement.&quot; The 
                                              two situations are distinguished 
                                              by the fact that it is of the 
                                              essence of a prize-fight that 
                                              there be spectators, whilst the 
                                              presence of spectators during an 
                                              ordinary fight is merely 
                                              incidental to the affray.47</span></p>

                                              it was undertaken, but this would 
                                              not be a material fact if it was

                                              committing a crime.&nbsp; For instance,

                                              for the purpose of assisting a 
                                              criminal venture. For example, is

                                              This provision also ensures that

                                              &quot;A Guide to Self-Deliverance&quot; 
                                              which described various ways by 
                                              which suicide might be 
                                              successfully committed. The 
                                              booklet was supplied to a 
                                              strictly-controlled group within 
                                              the membership of the Euthanasia 
                                              Society of which the accused 
                                              persons were also members. The 
                                              Attorney General of England sought 
                                              a declaration, inter alia, that 
                                              the supply of the booklet to 
                                              persons likely to include those 
                                              contemplating suicide, constituted 
                                              an offence or an attempt to aid, 
                                              abet, counsel and procure 
                                              suicide.&nbsp; The English court was of 
                                              the opinion that the act should 
                                              attract criminal liability because 
                                              such a supplier assumes a risk in 
                                              circulating such information to 
                                              various persons, some of whom 
                                              might be contemplating suicide. 
                                              Therefore the fact that the state 
                                              of mind of the actual recipient is 
                                              unknown, is immaterial to the 
                                              liability of the one who gives 
                                              currency to those ideas. The 
                                              court's position was strengthened 
                                              by the fact that some suicides, 
                                              with whom copies of the booklet 
                                              had been found, were outside the 
                                              controlled group to which the 
                                              booklet had been supplied. The 
                                              reasoning is supported by Act 29 
                                              because an act of this nature is 
                                              capable of rendering assistance to 
                                              persons contemplating that crime, 
                                              and it is also undertaken for that 
                                              purpose. It is therefore submitted 
                                              that in such situations, the 
                                              emphasis should shift from a 
                                              physical connection between the 
                                              parties as actors, to that of the 
                                              acts that produce the crime. This 
                                              shift would cover these new 
                                              situations which pose an even 
                                              greater danger to the welfare of 
                                              the society by reason of the sheer 
                                              number of possible recruits to a 
                                              criminal cause that the method of 
                                              mass communication adopted, would 
                                              offer. If a person cannot vouch 
                                              for the state of mind of all the 
                                              recipients of information that is 
                                              dangerous in the hands of the 
                                              uninitiated, that person must bear 
                                              the risk.</span></p>

                                              Under Act 29, a person who abets a 
                                              particular crime is deemed guilty 
                                              of that crime.&nbsp; It is likely that 
                                              even for an offence such as 
                                              manslaughter, the courts in Ghana 
                                              would be minded to follow the 
                                              reasoning in the English case of R 
                                              v Creamer.51&nbsp; The issue in that 
                                              case was whether a person could be 
                                              guilty as an accessory before the 
                                              fact to an unintentional act such 
                                              as manslaughter. The court came to 
                                              the conclusion that in the 
                                              appropriate situation, this would 
                                              be possible.&nbsp; The basis of the 
                                              reasoning was that if a person 
                                              counselled or procured the doing 
                                              of a dangerous act that could 
                                              result in death, then the person 
                                              was liable if death did result. 
                                              This is a defensible position to 
                                              take since such a person should be 
                                              presumed to intend the natural and 
                                              probable consequences of his act. 
                                              If the natural and probable 
                                              consequences of an instigation to 
                                              riot is death, there is no reason 
                                              why the instigator should escape 
                                              liability. </span></p>

                                              Punishment for the act of an 
                                              abettor is the same as that for 
                                              the principal actor, except where 
                                              the punishment is a death 
                                              sentence.&nbsp; This is the case 
                                              probably because they share the 
                                              mens rea, and differ only in terms 
                                              of the actus reus.&nbsp; One fact that 
                                              must be noted is that on occasion, 
                                              it is the abettor who even sows 
                                              the idea of the crime, or converts 
                                              a remote possibility into one with 
                                              better prospects; or makes the 
                                              thought of the crime less 
                                              repulsive; or offers such 
                                              assistance that problems likely to 
                                              impede the successful commission 
                                              of the offence are eliminated. All 
                                              these are acts that, in no small 
                                              measure, give prospective 
                                              offenders the confidence and 
                                              support needed to undertake the 
                                              venture.&nbsp; If all these activities 
                                              make the possibility of the 
                                              commission of the offence more 
                                              certain, then there is good reason 
                                              for punishing the principal 
                                              offender and the abettor to the

                                              Act 29 stops short of the death

                                              though the offence abetted is a 
                                              capital one.&nbsp; There is a lot to be 
                                              said for this attitude since the 
                                              hand that effects the deed carries 
                                              a bigger burden of guilt, than the 
                                              one who assisted it. However, 
                                              since various kinds of activity 
                                              constitute abetment, the rule can 
                                              sometimes work unfairness, 
                                              depending upon the activity in 
                                              issue.&nbsp; Where the abettor is the 
                                              instigator of the offence, 
                                              punishing that person less than 
                                              the principal offender may be 
                                              unfair when consideration is given

                                              the originator of the idea in the 
                                              first place.&nbsp; R v Udo52 
                                              illustrates the point being made. 
                                              In that case, the accused persons 
                                              had committed murder upon the 
                                              exhortation of the chief of their 
                                              village.&nbsp; The chief, one of whose 
                                              subjects had been murdered by 
                                              people from a neighbouring 
                                              village, instructed all his male 
                                              subjects that they were to bring 
                                              the head of any of those villagers 
                                              for the funeral rites of their 
                                              deceased kinsman.&nbsp; The accused 
                                              persons, believing it to be their 
                                              duty to ensure a proper funeral 
                                              for their murdered colleague, 
                                              committed the murder.&nbsp; In a 
                                              situation such as this, is the 
                                              chief any less guilty of murder 
                                              than the people who acted upon 
                                              those instructions?&nbsp; Why then 
                                              should those people be sentenced 
                                              to death whilst the chief gets off 
                                              with a lighter penalty?&nbsp; Much as 
                                              it is appreciated that there are 
                                              degrees of guilt, a blanket rule 
                                              for all abettors unduly favours 
                                              those who use others as tools for 
                                              their own misdeeds, at the expense 
                                              of those who contribute in minor 
                                              ways to the commission of the 
                                              offence.</span></p>

                                              case of abetment stands on its 
                                              own, and therefore the trial of an 
                                              abettor need not be with the 
                                              person abetted or even with the 
                                              co-abettor since each person is 
                                              answerable for the part that he or 
                                              she played in the commission of 
                                              the offence. Owing to the 
                                              operation of this rule, it is 
                                              theoretically possible to be 
                                              convicted of the abetment of an 
                                              offence when the principal 
                                              offender is acquitted in a 
                                              subsequent prosecution. This is in 
                                              spite of the general rule that one 
                                              cannot be guilty of abetting an 
                                              act which is not an offence.53&nbsp; 
                                              The above scenario could occur in 
                                              cases where a material part of the 
                                              offence, eg mens rea, is found to 
                                              be non-existent.&nbsp; In such a 
                                              situation, the offence would not 
                                              have been proved and therefore no 
                                              one ought to be guilty as an 
                                              accessory; but if the alleged 
                                              abettors have already been 
                                              convicted of the offence, the 
                                              incongruous situation described 
                                              would have occurred.54</span></p>

                                              For the same reason, an abettor 
                                              may have the benefit of a defence 
                                              to which none of the other 
                                              participants may be entitled.&nbsp; 
                                              Thus an abettor who was provoked 
                                              by the act of another may, unlike 
                                              the principal offender, have the 
                                              benefit of the defence of 
                                              provocation.55 In other words, an 
                                              abettor could be guilty of a 
                                              lesser charge than the principal 
                                              offender.&nbsp; The question of whether 
                                              the converse is also true has not 
                                              been without its difficulties.&nbsp; 
                                              The issue has by and large been 
                                              settled so that now under English 
                                              law, the same rule makes it 
                                              possible for an abettor to be 
                                              guilty of a greater charge than 
                                              the principal offender.&nbsp; Earlier 
                                              authorities had held that this 
                                              could not be possible since it was 
                                              the principal offence that 
                                              determined the liability attached 
                                              to the adjunct ones.&nbsp; Thus in R v 
                                              Richards56 it was held that one 
                                              who procured the commission of an 
                                              offence could not be guilty of a 
                                              graver offence than the principal 
                                              offender.&nbsp; This case has been 
                                              expressly overruled in R v Howe.57 
                                              Under Act 29, it is unlikely that 
                                              the Richards position would be 
                                              sustainable since provision is 
                                              made for the punishment of 
                                              offences that are not committed 
                                              according to the intent of the 
                                              abettor.&nbsp; Consequently, where the 
                                              offence abetted is more serious 
                                              than what is committed, the 
                                              abettor could be punished for this 
                                              and could thus be guilty of a more 
                                              serious offence than the 
                                              principal.</span></p>

                                              the offence whether or not the

                                              only avail with respect to an 
                                              offence to be committed in [the] 
                                              future, e.g. where a person having 
                                              given instructions to, say, his 
                                              servant, to go and beat up 
                                              someone, and before the servant 
                                              could put the directions into

                                              This therefore implies that timing 
                                              is of the essence because once the 
                                              commission of the offence has 
                                              begun, it is impossible to 
                                              effectively dissociate one's self 
                                              from the event.</span></p>

                                              It is also important to point out 
                                              that it is not every act of 
                                              abetment that relates to future 
                                              conduct.&nbsp; Some acts of abetment, 
                                              such as incitement (instigation), 
                                              are analogous to the offence of 
                                              conspiracy and constitute a 
                                              complete offence the moment they 
                                              are undertaken.&nbsp; In such 
                                              situations, the statement of 
                                              Ollennu JSC in respect of 
                                              conspiracy61 is equally relevant 
                                              because though a conspirator &quot;may 
                                              recant and withdraw from the 
                                              preparation of the substantive 
                                              offence ... he cannot undo the act 
                                              of his previous agreement.&quot;62&nbsp; 
                                              Such a change of heart would have 
                                              come too late to materially affect 
                                              the outcome of the venture.</span></p>

                                              Apart from these situations in 
                                              which the defence would not be 
                                              available, there are other 
                                              circumstances which would enable 
                                              an abettor to escape criminal 
                                              liability.&nbsp; An example is where 
                                              the accused person shows that 
                                              there was such an effective 
                                              countermand of instructions given 
                                              that the principal was not left in 
                                              any doubt that the erstwhile 
                                              abettor had no further interest in 
                                              the commission of the offence.&nbsp; In 
                                              the view of Lawrence J, to escape 
                                              being held guilty as an accessory 
                                              before the fact, the accused must 
                                              establish that he countermanded or 
                                              determined the agreement in such 
                                              clear terms that the&nbsp; subsequent 
                                              conduct could not be laid at his 
                                              door.63 Even in this situation, it 
                                              is clear that the kind of act in 
                                              question would be material in 
                                              showing that there was an 
                                              effective countermand.&nbsp; Where the 
                                              accused is alleged to have 
                                              counselled the commission of an 
                                              offence, it is likely that the 
                                              principal would be difficult to 
                                              dissuade once the criminal 
                                              possibilities have been exposed to 
                                              him or her.&nbsp; Ought a person who 
                                              gave currency to those ideas be 
                                              able to set up such a defence when 
                                              the offence is committed?&nbsp; Since 
                                              the human mind cannot be switched 
                                              on and off like a tape, it may be 
                                              impossible to effectively 
                                              &quot;countermand&quot; some activities 
                                              especially the psychological kind

                                              In dealing with issues of 
                                              complicity, one usually comes up 
                                              against problems that arise when a 
                                              multiplicity of persons undertake 
                                              a joint activity, or act together 
                                              under a loosely-defined 
                                              arrangement. These include 
                                              problems regarding excessive zeal 
                                              on the part of some of the actors, 
                                              impulsive acts that others do 
                                              under pressure, and last minute 
                                              changes in plans which are not

                                              parties.&nbsp; Some of these raise 
                                              issues of varying degrees of 
                                              difficulty.&nbsp; For instance, is a 
                                              person who abets a common assault 
                                              guilty if the principal uses an 
                                              offensive weapon during the 
                                              commission of the offence?&nbsp; What 
                                              is the liability of a person who 
                                              abets a riot if the other parties 
                                              commit murder during the riot?&nbsp; 
                                              Whilst the former problem relates 
                                              to the degree of gravity of 
                                              offence, the latter is a

                                              pointing to the fact that the 
                                              offence under contemplation was 
                                              unlawful rioting and not

                                              on the abettor.&nbsp; In the same vein, 
                                              if the wrong person were killed, 
                                              there would still be liability if 
                                              the evidence showed a plan to 
                                              cause death.&nbsp; The issue of whose 
                                              death had been planned, would be 
                                              of little relevance.67</span></p>

                                              In this particular situation, it 
                                              is the result of the &quot;endeavour to

                                              the focus of attention.&nbsp; Thus if 
                                              the crime that was committed 
                                              happens to be a lesser offence 
                                              than what was planned, the abettor

                                              the principal. This is the 
                                              situation represented by R v

                                              of the offence that is material. 
                                              Therefore the manner of commission 
                                              would not be relevant unless it 
                                              was so different from the one in 
                                              the parties' contemplation that it 
                                              cannot be attributed to the 
                                              influence of the abettor.&nbsp; If for 
                                              instance a person supplies a gun 
                                              for a murder, it would not be 
                                              material if the gun was used to

                                              instead of being fired. The 
                                              important issue would be the 
                                              supply of the murder weapon.&nbsp; 
                                              There would however be a material 
                                              difference if the death was caused 
                                              by poisoning and not by shooting.</span></p>

                                              abettor would be liable under the 
                                              provisions of Act 29 which

                                              committed. Even this would depend 
                                              on the act of the abettor. If it

                                              because liability arises only when

                                              act of the abettor would amount to 
                                              incitement which in turn is 
                                              punishable whether or not anyone 
                                              acts pursuant to the incitement. 
                                              This is not the case where the 
                                              acts done could support a range of 
                                              crimes, though done for a 
                                              particular purpose. In that case, 
                                              the crime committed would not be 
                                              considered to be different from 
                                              the one in the contemplation of 
                                              the abettor.&nbsp; The issue came up in 
                                              Director of Public Prosecutions 
                                              for Northern Ireland v Maxwell69 
                                              in which the appellant was 
                                              convicted of the abetment of 
                                              offences relating to the use of 
                                              explosives.&nbsp; The facts of the case 
                                              were that the appellant had been a 
                                              member of an illegal organisation 
                                              in Northern Ireland which had been 
                                              responsible for some murders and 
                                              bombings.&nbsp; He received orders one 
                                              day from his superiors to lead 
                                              another car to a pub in a certain 
                                              area.&nbsp; He complied with the 
                                              instruction although he did not 
                                              know exactly what was to be done 
                                              there. Unknown to him, the vehicle 
                                              contained explosives that were to 
                                              be used to bomb the pub. When the 
                                              attempted bombing failed, he was 
                                              arrested and charged and convicted 
                                              as an accomplice.&nbsp; He appealed, 
                                              contending that he had no way of 
                                              knowing that there was a bomb in 
                                              the car.&nbsp; Dismissing the appeal, 
                                              the court held that an abettor 
                                              need not know the actual crime 
                                              intended.&nbsp; It is enough if the 
                                              activity he engages in can only 
                                              lead to the commission of a 
                                              crime.&nbsp; Lord Scarman expressed a 
                                              view supported by the Code in the

                                              ways: either a completely 
                                              different crime takes place, or 
                                              one of the parties goes beyond 
                                              what was planned to commit a 
                                              different kind of offence.&nbsp; In 
                                              both situations, Act 29 would 
                                              require evidence that what was 
                                              done was not probable consequence 
                                              of the endeavour. This, as the 
                                              cases show, is not easy because 
                                              the court is apt to be averse to 
                                              drawing strict lines between what 
                                              was intended and what occurred.

                                              In the Puffer case, the facts were 
                                              as follows: three persons planned 
                                              to rob the deceased who had 
                                              invited one of them into his room 
                                              for homosexual activity.&nbsp; One of 
                                              them put a pillow on the face of 
                                              the deceased who was in 
                                              consequence, suffocated to death. 
                                              All three were convicted of the

                                              against their convictions, 
                                              contending that what happened was 
                                              different from what they planned 
                                              to do.&nbsp; The court dismissed the 
                                              appeals, holding that the parties, 
                                              not having strictly defined what

                                              body, the pinioning of hands, the 
                                              tying of feet could be regarded as 
                                              within the plan, but the use of 
                                              the pillow as the gag must be 
                                              looked upon as falling outside the 
                                              plan. Distinctions of this kind 
                                              could lead to a finding that a

                                              declared his intention to &quot;tear 
                                              the place down&quot;, the appellant 
                                              proceeded to help to gather bricks 
                                              and to hurl them through the glass 
                                              into the bar-room.&nbsp; In the 
                                              meantime, those within the pub 
                                              continued the fight till one of 
                                              them stabbed the barman with a 
                                              knife which he carried. The 
                                              appellant was subsequently 
                                              convicted of manslaughter because 
                                              he knew about the knife which his 
                                              friend carried.&nbsp; His appeal was 
                                              dismissed because the judge was of 
                                              the opinion that it was entirely 
                                              within the contemplation of the 
                                              appellant that in the disturbance 
                                              they were creating, anybody who 
                                              tried to stop them would be 
                                              attacked.&nbsp; That being the case, 
                                              his knowledge that one of them had 
                                              a knife made it obvious that the 
                                              knife would be used in any such 
                                              attack.&nbsp; Therefore if the knife 
                                              had been used with deadly results, 
                                              the appellant could not escape 
                                              liability. It is clear that the 
                                              court was refusing to be drawn 
                                              into a line-drawing contest in a 
                                              situation in which clearly the 
                                              parties had all agreed to create a 
                                              disturbance.&nbsp; This is a sensible 
                                              attitude on the part of the court 
                                              since a contrary attitude would 
                                              lead the court into drawing all 
                                              manner of artificial distinctions 
                                              after the fact.</span></p>

                                              It is unlikely that the Ghanaian 
                                              courts would be finicky about 
                                              drawing lines and deciding which

                                              unlawful assembly, Act 29 enjoins

                                              In Chan Wing-Siu, three persons 
                                              attacked a prostitute and her 
                                              husband in their flat.&nbsp; Two of the 
                                              attackers carried knives, but the 
                                              third one did not carry any.&nbsp; The 
                                              husband was stabbed to death and 
                                              the three were convicted of 
                                              murder. The third appellant 
                                              contended that since there had 
                                              been no prior agreement that they 
                                              would take a knife along or use 
                                              it, he had been wrongly convicted 
                                              of murder. The Privy Council held 
                                              that in such circumstances, a 
                                              foreseeability test would be 
                                              applied.&nbsp; Was it foreseeable that 
                                              even though not desired, the event 
                                              would occur?&nbsp; If yes, then the 
                                              criminal culpability is founded on 
                                              the fact that the person took part 
                                              in that enterprise with that 
                                              foresight.&nbsp; </span></p>

                                              This position seems to have been 
                                              challenged by the later case of R 
                                              v Wakely, Symonds, Holy76 in which 
                                              a trial judge was reversed because 
                                              he directed the jury using the 
                                              foreseeability test.&nbsp; The three 
                                              accused persons in that case had 
                                              gone to the house of an elderly 
                                              man to rob the gas meter.&nbsp; One of 
                                              them, against the agreement of the 
                                              others, had taken along an 
                                              axehandle.&nbsp; This weapon was 
                                              eventually used to beat the old 
                                              man to death.&nbsp; In holding that the 
                                              trial judge had misdirected the 
                                              jury, Lord Lane declared that77: 
                                              &quot;The suggestion that a mere 
                                              foresight of the real or definite 
                                              possibility of violence being used 
                                              is sufficient to constitute the 
                                              mental element of murder is prima 
                                              facie, academically speaking at 
                                              least, not sufficient.&quot;&nbsp; This is 
                                              somewhat strange, given the 
                                              circumstances. Even though the 
                                              axehandle had been taken along 
                                              against the agreement of the 
                                              majority, they must have known 
                                              that their colleague intended to 
                                              use it if their attempt to rob was 
                                              resisted. As things turned out, it 
                                              was unclear which of them used the 
                                              axehandle and therefore their 
                                              initial opposition 
                                              notwithstanding, the presence of 
                                              the weapon must have been a source 
                                              of comfort to them as they 
                                              embarked on their criminal 
                                              activity. Lord Lane's statement 
                                              has been criticised by one 
                                              author78 who maintains that Chan

                                              authority on the subject because 
                                              Lord Lane showed some confusion in

                                              not a crime though one of the 
                                              participants does an unlawful act

                                              objective, there would be no 
                                              liability. This situation was

                                              This position makes sense because 
                                              for an act to constitute an 
                                              abetment, it must be done for an 
                                              unlawful purpose.&nbsp; If this were 
                                              not so, virtually every act could

                                              In this paper, an attempt has been 
                                              made to examine the law of 
                                              complicity under the Criminal 
                                              Code, 1960 (Act 29) of Ghana.&nbsp; 
                                              This has been done with the aid of 
                                              decided cases from Ghana as well 
                                              as other common law 
                                              jurisdictions.&nbsp; Although it has 
                                              been noted that there are very few 
                                              Ghanaian authorities on the issues 
                                              discussed, the usefulness of the 
                                              exercise lies in the certain 
                                              knowledge that these questions 
                                              would confront our courts with the 
                                              passage of time.</span></p>

                                              The law on complicity in Ghana can 
                                              therefore be summarised as 
                                              follows: Any person who in any way 
                                              assists or renders assistance in 
                                              the commission of an offence 
                                              incurs criminal liability.&nbsp; This 
                                              does not include mere presence at 
                                              the scene of a crime, if the 
                                              presence is merely accidental or 
                                              does nothing to encourage the 
                                              actors.&nbsp; In like vein, any person 
                                              who does any act for the purpose 
                                              of assisting another in the 
                                              commission of an offence whether 
                                              the act does in fact do so or not 
                                              - is guilty of an offence. This 
                                              may include acts which though 
                                              ordinary, may have been done on a 
                                              particular occasion for the 
                                              purpose of assisting in the 
                                              commission of an offence.&nbsp; It, 
                                              however, excludes the mere fact of 
                                              chancing upon the commission of an 
                                              offence by others, coupled with a 
                                              subsequent failure to report the 
                                              incident.</span></p>

                                              As to issues of joint enterprise, 
                                              it would appear that a person is 
                                              liable for results that are the 
                                              foreseeable consequences of 
                                              criminal acts that are done.&nbsp; This 
                                              would cover crimes that are 
                                              substantially the same as those 
                                              abetted as well as those which 
                                              though different, are foreseeable 
                                              as being possible of commission in 
                                              the course of the abetment. There 
                                              is also criminal liability for the 
                                              one who provides the facilities 
                                              for the commission of a range of 
                                              offences, when any of that range 
                                              of offences is committed. The 
                                              reasoning for this is sound as it 
                                              would be impossible to pin any of 
                                              those crimes on the abettor if 
                                              that were not the case.&nbsp; </span>

                                              fact and principals in the second 
                                              degree is also commendable. This 
                                              not only ensures that moral 
                                              support, material support, as well 
                                              as physical assistance are treated 
                                              the same, but also simplifies the 
                                              task of the prosecution. This is 
                                              because there is no difference of 
                                              substance in moral culpability 
                                              between the one who supplies a 
                                              ladder for a burglary and the one 
                                              who holds it during the commission 
                                              of the crime.&nbsp; Indeed, it is 
                                              arguable that the one who incites 
                                              another to crime is more evil than 
                                              one who acts as a lookout and so 
                                              enables the crime to be committed. 
                                              Therefore, owing to the abolition 
                                              of this distinction, everyone who 
                                              is party to an unlawful enterprise 
                                              is punishable to the same extent.</span></p>

                                              standing by itself, was an act of 
                                              abetment and should have been 
                                              treated as such.&nbsp; This should be

                                              in Boateng the intention was not 
                                              to commit an offence, but to stop 
                                              the girl from feeling sleepy in

                                              her husband badly enough to land

                                              managed to escape with only slight 
                                              injury. The attackers were charged

                                              wounding, whilst the appellant was
