                                              The outgoing three decades have 
                                              seen rapid and vigorous 
                                              nation-building activity on the 
                                              African continent. With the 
                                              possible exception of Ethiopia, 
                                              Egypt, Liberia and the Union of 
                                              South Africa, over 36 countries 
                                              have by now extricated themselves 
                                              from the throes of political and 
                                              legal domination of foreign powers 
                                              and raised their own national flag 
                                              as independent countries. Most of 
                                              them had had very long contracts 
                                              and continuous association with 
                                              many and varied kinds of European 
                                              powers. Ancient writers ascribe 
                                              the first contacts of foreigners 
                                              with West Africa to Egyptians and 
                                              Phoenicians.1 French authors claim 
                                              discovery of the Gold Coast in 
                                              1382 “in which year the merchants 
                                              of Dieppe, with those of Rouen, 
                                              sent three ships to the West 
                                              African coast, one of which, La 
                                              Vierge, they say, went as far as 
                                              Odena in the Gold Coast, which was 
                                              named La Mina because of the large 
                                              quantity of gold there obtained”2 
                                              The Portuguese arrived in&nbsp; the&nbsp;

                                              followed in quick&nbsp; succession by 
                                              the English, the French, Dutch, 
                                              Swedes, Danes and Brandenburgers 
                                              and Germans.4 In common with many 
                                              West African countries, therefore, 
                                              Ghana had had, before her 
                                              independence in March 1957, about 
                                              four and a half centuries of 
                                              economic association, at first 
                                              sporadic, but of steadily growing 
                                              dimensions in the last one and&nbsp; a 
                                              half centuries with Western 
                                              European powers. With England, she 
                                              had three centuries. But only half 
                                              of that time saw the beginnings 
                                              and consolidation of a partnership 
                                              exclusive of other European 
                                              competitors. Within that century 
                                              and a half, trade, at first in 
                                              gold and slaves, then later (as 
                                              from 1847) in other commodities, 
                                              such as ivory, rubber, and in 
                                              1894, cocoa, etc. grew and 
                                              expanded. British courts were 
                                              established, English law was 
                                              introduced, at first within the 
                                              forts and then later in the whole 
                                              countryside, side by side with 
                                              native courts and native law.</span></p>

                                              family would, as now, be resolved 
                                              by a council of elders presided 
                                              over by the head of the family; or 
                                              where such dispute involved two 
                                              branches of a lineage, then at a 
                                              council presided over by the 
                                              lineage head or an arbitrator from 
                                              a nearby friendly and reputable

                                              Few matters are often left to the

                                              centralised states such as 
                                              Ashanti, for example, the Omanhene 
                                              occupies a dual position: (1) He 
                                              is the occupier of the stool of 
                                              the capital city of the whole 
                                              state or federation; to that 
                                              extent, he exercises original 
                                              jurisdiction much in the same way 
                                              and over the same types of cases 
                                              as an odikro or ohene or 
                                              divisional chief. A further 
                                              extension of his jurisdiction at 
                                              first instance over matters 
                                              occurring anywhere in the state 
                                              found its genesis in a procedural 
                                              initiative on the part of any of 
                                              the parties to the suit. The 
                                              swearing of the Omanhene’s great 
                                              oath, or the great oath of the 
                                              state, immediately brought a suit 
                                              into the Omanhene’s Supreme Court. 
                                              (2) As a Supreme Court of the 
                                              land, it acted also as the final 
                                              appellate court in all matters 
                                              dealt with in the courts of the 
                                              state and brought to it on appeal.

                                              common traditional pattern of

                                              merchants combined to urge upon 
                                              the British Government the 
                                              desirability of the central 
                                              government's assuming broader and 
                                              more lasting political control in 
                                              the trading posts. When in 1859 
                                              and 1872 the Dutch transferred all 
                                              their forts to the British and 
                                              left Ghana,6 the stage was set for 
                                              active British Administration in 
                                              Ghana. Before then, however, there 
                                              had been feeble attempts at 
                                              judicial administration. To these 
                                              we will now turn.</span></p>

                                              Sir Charles McCarthy arrived in 
                                              the Gold Coast in 1822 as 
                                              Governor. In that capacity he 
                                              established petty debt courts and 
                                              appointed magistrates from the 
                                              ranks of the local merchants. The 
                                              jurisdiction of these courts was 
                                              limited to the British forts (at 
                                              this time very few indeed) and 
                                              therefore to be exercised, as far 
                                              as the local inhabitants or 
                                              natives were concerned, only upon 
                                              those who worked as assistants in 
                                              the forts. The exigencies of 
                                              British economic interests and the 
                                              appeal of the white man's law to 
                                              the natives soon led the 
                                              magistrates into extending their 
                                              jurisdiction into areas 
                                              immediately around the forts and 
                                              into the immediate countryside. 
                                              Governor George Maclean's report 
                                              of November 1836 acknowledged the 
                                              glaring excess of jurisdiction but 
                                              defended the status quo and

                                              Following upon Dr Madden's Report 
                                              of 1841 the British Settlements 
                                              Act was passed empowering the

                                              institutions and Ordinances, and 
                                              to constitute such courts and 
                                              offices, and to make such 
                                              provisions and regulations for the 
                                              proceedings in such courts, and 
                                              for the administration of justice 
                                              as may be necessary for the peace,

                                              Majesty's subjects and others 
                                              within the said present or future 
                                              settlements respectively, or any

                                              notwithstanding. Thereafter a 
                                              judicial assessor's court was 
                                              established with Governor George 
                                              Maclean as judicial assessor. He 
                                              sat with and acted as adviser to 
                                              an august court of Amanhene. 
                                              Implicit in this development is a 
                                              certain degree of recognition of 
                                              native courts. This court, though 
                                              masquerading as the highest native 
                                              court of the Fanti states, was a 
                                              creation of the British. 
                                              Technically, it was neither a 
                                              British nor a native court. But 
                                              its existence provided a useful 
                                              and fruitful liaison between the 
                                              two systems. It functioned without 
                                              any pretensions to a usurpation of 
                                              the work of native courts. The 
                                              reasons for this are not far to 
                                              seek.</span></p>

                                              subject to the Crown, and British 
                                              magistrates were scattered over 
                                              it, the sooner the native 
                                              authority (were) destroyed, the 
                                              better.”9 The eastern states, 
                                              mostly beyond the Volta River, 
                                              were&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mainly in the hands of the 
                                              Danes and the Germans. During the 
                                              period under consideration, 
                                              therefore, British influence

                                              Bond of 1844 and the directives to 
                                              the judicial officers established 
                                              a clear presumption in favour of 
                                              customary law unless it was 
                                              “barbarous”, or an “abomination” 
                                              and therefore “contrary to law” or 
                                              where it was incompatible with the 
                                              lay of England.15</span></p>

                                              On 4 April 1856 the Crown issued 
                                              an Order-in-Council under the

                                              and Falklands Act, 1843 extending

                                              articles with regard to the 
                                              administration of estates”17 were 
                                              stipulated as the courts’ new 
                                              areas of jurisdiction. 
                                              Considerable doubt prevailed, 
                                              however, as to what such articles 
                                              were. As Sarbah remarked, “What 
                                              that jurisdiction (i.e. in

                                              administration of estates) was it 
                                              is difficult to say, but as the 
                                              chief Justice was also Judicial 
                                              Assessor there would not have been 
                                              any conflict.”18 Section 3 of the 
                                              Order-in-Council emphasised, as 
                                              before, that equitable regard be 
                                              paid to local customs by all 
                                              judicial officers. No clear 
                                              conflictual rules emerge from such 
                                              a confusing situation. While it 
                                              may be said that a clear 
                                              presumption was established in 
                                              favour of customary law, the 
                                              limitations and qualifications 
                                              surrounding its application were 
                                              such as to allow a judicial 
                                              officer, if he chose to, to apply 
                                              English law by stigmatising a 
                                              particular customary law rule as 
                                              barbarous, abominable, contrary to 
                                              natural justice, equity and good

                                              however, the way was cleared for a

                                              involvement in the administration

                                              It will be remembered that on the 
                                              amalgamation of the Gold Coast 
                                              administration with that of Sierra 
                                              Leone in 1866 the courts of the 
                                              judicial assessor and magistrates 
                                              continued to operate. The Supreme 
                                              Court Ordinance of 1876 cleared 
                                              this dead-wood away.26 and 
                                              transferred the powers of these 
                                              courts to the new Supreme Court. 
                                              New magistrate courts were 
                                              established27 deriving their birth 
                                              entirely from the Supreme Court 
                                              Ordinance of 1876. Their only link 
                                              with the passing era would seem to 
                                              be the retention of the old 
                                              geographical limits. Their 
                                              personnel was mainly district 
                                              commissioners, for, by then, the 
                                              ranks of qualified lawyers were 
                                              still very small indeed.28 
                                              District commissioners, authorised 
                                              to exercise judicial powers, were 
                                              therefore constituted ex officio 
                                              commissioners of the Supreme Court 
                                              and invested with authority to 
                                              exercise the powers of a judge of 
                                              the Supreme Court.29</span></p>

                                              Thus at the beginning of 1877 the 
                                              pattern of courts would seem to be 
                                              a rigid dichotomy between the 
                                              British and customary courts. 
                                              Indeed, in spite of the useful 
                                              liaison provided by the Judicial 
                                              Assessor's Court, there was, until 
                                              1877, no fusion of courts. The 
                                              Chief Justice of the pre-1866 era 
                                              did not preside over a fused 
                                              court. As judicial assessor he 
                                              acted merely as adviser to native 
                                              chiefs although in time he tended 
                                              to act more and more like the 
                                              president of the court.30 From 
                                              1877, however, our chiefs played 
                                              an advisory role in the British 
                                              courts whenever the British judges 
                                              needed their advice on questions 
                                              touching on customary law.31 The 
                                              lingering desire to see native 
                                              courts fall into desuetude had

                                              Two points call for comment here: 
                                              (1) the limitation of local 
                                              jurisdiction and circumstances 
                                              import a territorial limitation; 
                                              and (2) customary law was not to 
                                              be ignored since it formed part of 
                                              the local circumstances. This

                                              The significance of these 
                                              provisions in the development of 
                                              customary law and ultimately, of 
                                              the common law of Ghana is very 
                                              far-reaching indeed. Recording of 
                                              decisions and adherence to stare 
                                              decisis led to a greater and 
                                              growing degree of certainly and 
                                              uniformity in decisions touching 
                                              principles of customary law. For 
                                              the ascertainment of such 
                                              principles, English tests as to 
                                              when a custom could qualify as or 
                                              matured into law were applied, 
                                              leading sometimes to the denial of 
                                              legal force to certain customs 
                                              which customary law itself would 
                                              have enforced as law.35</span></p>

                                              It is not clear what reasons of 
                                              policy or convenience dictated the 
                                              total silence of the Supreme Court 
                                              Ordinance on native courts in 
                                              1876. However, for some time prior

                                              official preference had been 
                                              running in favour of their 
                                              complete abolition.36 Success in

                                              control which followed seemed to 
                                              strengthen in the British mind the 
                                              case for abolition37 The 
                                              Order-in-Council of 6 August 1876

                                              by conquest.38 It would appear 
                                              then that when in 1876 the Supreme 
                                              Court Ordinance was being passed 
                                              to establish judicial institutions 
                                              for the country, a clear but

                                              decided against any recognition of 
                                              native courts. But could the

                                              Two significant observations about 
                                              this designation of subject matter 
                                              jurisdiction must be noted here: 
                                              (1) The native courts had no 
                                              jurisdiction in suits relating to 
                                              succession to the land of deceased 
                                              natives. Suits relating to 
                                              ownership and possession are land 
                                              suits, and a land suit is not a 
                                              succession suit unless the claim 
                                              to ownership and/or possession is 
                                              based upon the right to succeed an 
                                              owner or possessor whose title is 
                                              not in dispute or in issue.46 
                                              Thus, a native court's decision 
                                              touching succession to land could 
                                              be attacked for excess of 
                                              jurisdiction. The native court 
                                              itself was obligated to refer such 
                                              matters to the “Commissioner” 
                                              (which means the Secretary for 
                                              Native Affairs, or other officer 
                                              appointed by the Governor for the 
                                              consideration of all or any 
                                              matters relating to or in dispute 
                                              respectively in the native 
                                              tribunals).47 Appeals also lay to 
                                              the commissioner who might divert 
                                              them to a superior native 
                                              tribunal; and (2) Personal suits 
                                              and suits relating to succession 
                                              to goods of deceased natives were 
                                              not expressly limited to suits in 
                                              which the law involved is 
                                              customary law. Hence, native 
                                              courts could apply English law, 
                                              especially where the nature of the 
                                              transaction on which the suit was 
                                              based contemplated the application 
                                              of English law; or in the case of 
                                              wills under the Wills Act for the 
                                              disposition of the personally 
                                              acquired goods of a native, or in 
                                              the case of suits relating to the 
                                              succession to the goods of a 
                                              deceased native married under the 
                                              Marriage Ordinance. The mere fact 
                                              then that the law involved was 
                                              English law would not be 
                                              sufficient to bring the case 
                                              within the reference provisions of 
                                              section 21. Although the 
                                              presumption would be that only 
                                              customary law would apply in the 
                                              native courts, nothing prevented 
                                              any such court from a pretension 
                                              to sophistication and the 
                                              application of English law. 
                                              Whether or not these possibilities 
                                              were present to the minds of the 
                                              legislators may be debatable. But 
                                              the provisions relating to 
                                              jurisdiction over persons reveal 
                                              skepticism about the quality of 
                                              customary law itself as a just 
                                              system of law and doubt as to the 
                                              judicial competence of those who 
                                              administered it.48</span></p>

                                              courts any jurisdiction over the 
                                              Crown except upon the 
                                              Attorney-General's fiat.49 Native 
                                              courts had no such jurisdiction 
                                              under any circumstances, provided 
                                              the Crown was a party and/or the 
                                              suit was brought “for the 
                                              protection of the revenue.”50 Very 
                                              nice distinctions could arise 
                                              under such provisions. In England, 
                                              the denial of jurisdiction where 
                                              the Crown was a party to a suit 
                                              often led to suits against the 
                                              wrongdoer personally. A servant is 
                                              always primarily liable for his 
                                              torts, for example, and inability 
                                              to reach and enforce a judgment 
                                              against his master does not 
                                              extinguish the servant’s 
                                              liability. If a servant were 
                                              personally sued before the native 
                                              courts for a debt, damage or 
                                              demand arising from his own acts, 
                                              though performed in the course of 
                                              his employment, he would be unable 
                                              to avoid the court’s jurisdiction 
                                              because the Crown would not be a 
                                              party to the suit. Secondly, any 
                                              suit to recover money from the 
                                              crown even if revenue is not 
                                              involved would seem to be outside 
                                              the native courts' jurisdiction 
                                              because the Crown would be a 
                                              party.</span></p>

                                              The system of native judicial 
                                              administration thus established 
                                              was clearly a half-way measure, 
                                              reluctantly introduced to operate 
                                              only in areas where British 
                                              Administration was still merely 
                                              incipient and therefore requiring 
                                              a larger measure of local 
                                              participation or co-operation. As 
                                              Sarbah notes, “The settled policy 
                                              of the government has been, not to 
                                              extend the provisions of the

                                              stationed.”56 Secondly, the native 
                                              courts were largely kept within a 
                                              rigid system of their own with 
                                              appeals to the Commissioner for 
                                              Native Affairs as an absolute 
                                              prerequisite to any appeal to a 
                                              British court.57 While a British 
                                              court could directly refer to 
                                              native courts cases properly 
                                              cognisable by them, references 
                                              from native courts, must first 
                                              pass through the Commissioner for 
                                              Native Affairs. In land cases, 
                                              i.e. for ownership or possession, 
                                              the commissioner could refuse an 
                                              appeal to a Divisional Court only 
                                              if the Queen's Advocate agreed 
                                              with him. In the event of a 
                                              disagreement between these two 
                                              functionaries, the matter was 
                                              referred to the Governor, or, at 
                                              the Governor's discretion, to the 
                                              Chief Justice; the decision of the 
                                              Governor or the Chief Justice was 
                                              final. In the areas (generally 
                                              along the coastal belt) where the 
                                              administration's native courts 
                                              were not established, the 
                                              traditional native tribunals 
                                              continued to function, but 
                                              apparently shorn of certain powers 
                                              in the official hope that they 
                                              might by gradual disuse, become 
                                              unimportant and fall into 
                                              desuetude. This trend of events 
                                              reflects, to some extent, the 
                                              cautious recognition which in 1872 
                                              Chalmers thought the native courts

                                              the jurisdictional structure that

                                              Administratively, Togoland was 
                                              divided into a northern79 and a 
                                              southern section.80 For 
                                              convenience, the northern section 
                                              was administered as part of the 
                                              Northern Territories, and the 
                                              southern section as part of the 
                                              Eastern Province of the Gold 
                                              Coast.81 Therefore, with minor 
                                              administrative modifications, the 
                                              British courts' pattern existing 
                                              in the Colony and the Northern 
                                              Territories became the model for 
                                              Togoland. With a Divisional Court 
                                              at Keta, however, only a district 
                                              commissioner's court was 
                                              established at Ho for the southern 
                                              section of Togoland with power to 
                                              exercise the same kind of 
                                              jurisdiction as was exercised by 
                                              the district commissioner of the 
                                              Keta-Ada District of the Colony 
                                              when sitting at Keta. 
                                              Occasionally, the court's 
                                              personnel included the provincial 
                                              commissioner himself or his deputy 
                                              who, because of their higher 
                                              political status, became thereby 
                                              invested with power to try 
                                              offences ranging up to 
                                              “man-slaughter by negligence,”82 
                                              where in the opinion of the said 
                                              court, the offence was one which 
                                              could adequately be dealt with by 
                                              a sentence of imprisonment, with 
                                              or without hard labour, for a term 
                                              not exceeding two years.83 The 
                                              chief commissioners’ courts, 
                                              presided over by the Chief

                                              were established in the two areas 
                                              as their highest British

                                              judges were appointed to these 
                                              courts,85 but the courts continued 
                                              to be styled the chief 
                                              commissioner's court. With the 
                                              appointment of circuit judges, the 
                                              jurisdiction of the chief

                                              to include divorce and matrimonial

                                              One significant departure from 
                                              practice in the Colony has to be 
                                              noted here. It is common practice

                                              an accused person. This procedure 
                                              prevailed in the Colony. In

                                              courts.99 They administered mainly

                                              traditional rulers; but provision 
                                              was made for the appointment of an

                                              mainly customary law; but under

                                              Further evidence that the court

                                              found in section 15(b) which 
                                              permitted the court to apply “the

                                              court could still assume

                                              replaced.103 The application by 
                                              native courts of a law other than 
                                              customary law was itself no novel 
                                              provision in 1958. It was 
                                              perfectly possible under the very 
                                              first enactment regulating native 
                                              courts.104 Subsequent legislation 
                                              prior to 1958 also gave native 
                                              courts jurisdiction over “personal 
                                              suits in which the debt, damage or 
                                              demand does not exceed one hundred 
                                              pounds.”105 Legislative history 
                                              clearly shows that the native 
                                              courts in Ghana were never at any 
                                              time intended to be, and the 
                                              native courts did not personally 
                                              consider themselves to be, mere 
                                              customary courts applying only 
                                              customary law. After the military 
                                              coup d'etat in February 1966, the 
                                              National Liberation Council 
                                              repealed the Courts Act, 1960 (CA 
                                              9) and promulgated in its place a 
                                              new Courts Decree, 1966.106</span></p>

                                              The most revolutionary development 
                                              under this Decree was the 
                                              disappearance of local courts. In 
                                              their place district or 
                                              magistrates’ courts were 
                                              established. The division of these 
                                              magistrate's or district courts 
                                              into grades I and II creates the 
                                              unfortunate picture of the 
                                              continuation of the local courts 
                                              in a new garb. This may well be 
                                              the discerning lawyer's analysis 
                                              hinged on lingering memory. And 
                                              such observation appears to 
                                              receive telling emphasis from the 
                                              fact that while lay magistrates 
                                              may preside over the district 
                                              courts grade II they cannot try 
                                              cases pending before district 
                                              courts grade I: such a trial will 
                                              result in a nullity.107 The Courts 
                                              Act, 1971 (Act 372) has not

                                              As has been noted earlier, a lay 
                                              magistrate cannot try a case in a 
                                              district court grade I. This does 
                                              not prevent such a magistrate from 
                                              presiding over a grade I court. 
                                              But while sitting in such grade I 
                                              court the lay magistrate can 
                                              apparently only postpone or 
                                              adjourn proceedings for trial by a 
                                              grade I magistrate or a circuit 
                                              judge or a judge of the superior 
                                              court. Although lay magistrates 
                                              can therefore still be found on 
                                              the bench, various legislative 
                                              enactments indicate a growing 
                                              trend towards their gradual 
                                              phasing-out and complete 
                                              elimination from the ranks of the 
                                              judiciary.108 This development 
                                              follows the recommendations of the 
                                              Korsah Commission of 1950 and 
                                              constitutes the clearest break

                                              committee's decision, there has

                                              and distinct courts and not, as 
                                              before, a Supreme Court consisting 
                                              of a Court of Appeal and a High 
                                              Court. Under the Constitution, 
                                              1969, however, three superior 
                                              courts were established. These 
                                              were the Supreme Court, the Court 
                                              of Appeal and the High Court. 
                                              After the 1972 coup d’etat the 
                                              Supreme Court was abolished on the 
                                              argument that the small volume of 
                                              work undertaken by it between July 
                                              1969 and January 1972 did not 
                                              justify its existence. Indeed, 
                                              since its functions were designed 
                                              to be mainly structured around 
                                              conflicts involving the 
                                              Constitution, it was felt also 
                                              that its raison d'etre was 
                                              seriously eroded by the suspension 
                                              of the Constitution, 1969.</span></p>

                                              Circuit courts which had been

                                              introduced in 1960 and have now 
                                              become a permanent rung in the

                                              of concurrent jurisdiction with

                                              The Constitution, 1979 preserves 
                                              the pattern of courts established 
                                              since 1960. In particular, the 
                                              Supreme Court abolished in 1972 
                                              was re-established. These 
                                              developments have substantially 
                                              survived the 31 December 1981 
                                              military coup d’etat and 
                                              revolution. Section 1 of the 
                                              Provisional National Defence 
                                              Council (Establishment) 
                                              Proclamation, 1981 preserved all 
                                              courts in existence immediately 
                                              before 31 December 1981 with the 
                                              same powers, duties and functions 
                                              under the existing law subject to 
                                              the Proclamation and laws issued 
                                              thereunder. Two laws subsequently 
                                              enacted under the Proclamation 
                                              dealt with the regular courts. 
                                              These are the Courts (Amendment) 
                                              Law, 1983 (PNDCL 47)111 and the 
                                              Courts (Amendment) Law, 1987 (PNDCL 
                                              191). These enactments did not 
                                              effect any changes whatsoever in 
                                              the existing basic structure of 
                                              the regular courts; instead, they 
                                              merely made relevant adjustments 
                                              (taking the dramatic and drastic 
                                              fall in money values into 
                                              consideration) in the amounts 
                                              which set out the limits of the 
                                              jurisdiction of the district and 
                                              circuit courts.112 In order to 
                                              remove the necessity for frequent 
                                              central government legislative 
                                              amendment to the Courts Act in 
                                              this regard, power to make 
                                              relevant adjustments in the 
                                              currency values delimiting the 
                                              jurisdiction of the courts was now 
                                              vested in the Chief Justice.113 
                                              Furthermore, district courts grade 
                                              I114 and circuit courts115 were 
                                              for the first time given 
                                              jurisdiction to grant probate or 
                                              letters of administration. This 
                                              new policy relieves very 
                                              substantially the work-load and 
                                              pressure on the High Courts in 
                                              respect of such applications. In 
                                              addition it affords an opportunity 
                                              for these applications to be 
                                              presented and processed in the 
                                              courts closer than before to the 
                                              last known place of abode of the 
                                              deceased. An opportunity was taken 
                                              also to re-arrange and refine the 
                                              language of the various sections 
                                              of the principal enactment, Act 
                                              372, delineating the allocation of 
                                              appellate competences between the 
                                              various courts.116 In many cases 
                                              an appeal lies “as of right” 
                                              either from the High Court to the 
                                              Court of Appeal or from the Court 
                                              of Appeal to the Supreme Court.117 
                                              Generally, however, the High Court 
                                              and the Court of Appeal may refuse 
                                              leave for further appeal from 
                                              their decisions where such 
                                              decision confirmed the decision of 
                                              the court from which the appeal 
                                              was presented. But such a refusal 
                                              is not final because the aggrieved 
                                              party may apply to the next 
                                              appellate court for the leave.118</span></p>

                                              national radio, newspaper 
                                              publication or national television 
                                              or other notice in any medium of 
                                              mass communication,”134 and, if 
                                              the accused fails to appear, try 
                                              him in his absence.135 A regular 
                                              court cannot proceed to trial by 
                                              any of these methods, if an 
                                              accused, duly served with notice 
                                              to attend, fails to appear, the 
                                              court can only issue a bench 
                                              warrant, keep the case in view and 
                                              wait for the police to arrest and 
                                              bring the accused to court on the 
                                              warrant.136 Generally, a regular 
                                              court does not admit relevant 
                                              evidence if it is hearsay or 
                                              prejudicial. A public tribunal is 
                                              enjoined to receive “all relevant 
                                              evidence in proof or disproof of a 
                                              charge against the accused . . .” 
                                              The only restriction on the use of 
                                              such “relevant&quot; evidence is that 
                                              &quot;the accused shall not be 
                                              convicted on hearsay evidence 
                                              alone.”137 A tribunal possesses 
                                              power to convict an accused if it 
                                              “is satisfied that all things 
                                              considered, the offence was 
                                              committed by the accused.”138 This 
                                              bland fiat permits the trial 
                                              tribunal to act on a kind of hunch 
                                              and a certain consideration of 
                                              social justice rather than rigidly 
                                              subject the evidence to the 
                                              ingredients of the specific 
                                              offence charged. Indeed, a 
                                              tribunal is permitted to act, in 
                                              the course of a trial, in 
                                              accordance with what “appears to 
                                              it to be just having regard to the 
                                              circumstances.”139</span></p>

                                              It has been observed that the 
                                              Supreme Court Ordinance, 1876 laid 
                                              the foundations of the modern 
                                              system of courts. The foregoing 
                                              analysis has shown, however, that 
                                              since 1876, much change and 
                                              adaptation has been effected, 
                                              sometimes very revolutionarily, to 
                                              meet constitutional exigencies and 
                                              to achieve efficiency. A single 
                                              national system of courts now 
                                              emerges from these changes. But 
                                              the changes in some directions at 
                                              least invoke some disturbing

                                              The term “Supreme Court” has often 
                                              been used to refer to a composite 
                                              cluster of courts that has not 
                                              consisted of the same number of 
                                              courts on each occasion, eg the 
                                              Court of Appeal was established 
                                              for the first time in 1960 and 
                                              made part of the Supreme Court. 
                                              This quite clearly creates 
                                              confusion in the use of the term

                                              suggested that the term be 
                                              reserved solely for the highest 
                                              court of the country - in other 
                                              words, the&nbsp; Supreme Court should

                                              to varying dimensions since 1876. 
                                              Under the 1876 Ordinance, each 
                                              Divisional Court exercised 
                                              jurisdiction only within a 
                                              particular province or territory 
                                              geographically delineated. This

                                              geographical area was abolished in 
                                              1971 with the result that the High 
                                              Court was considered to be a

                                              regional capitals. Recent 
                                              legislation has created a return 
                                              to the distinct geographical

                                              policy considerations underlie 
                                              these chameleon-like changes. 
                                              Obviously, the 1971 conceptual 
                                              picture of the High Court as “the 
                                              High Court”, a single court with 
                                              branches in other parts of the 
                                              country appears to be a more 
                                              desirable alternative in 
                                              structuring. It prevents technical 
                                              objections to venue, prevents loss 
                                              of filing fees if the papers are 
                                              initially filed in the wrong 
                                              geographical jurisdiction. If the 
                                              objection is that the single court 
                                              concept might lead to too many 
                                              cases in places like Accra, such 
                                              difficulties can be solved through 
                                              appropriate transfers of cases.145</span></p>

                                              These have been the magistrates’ 
                                              courts under the Supreme Court 
                                              Ordinance, 1876. Native courts 
                                              (later changed into local courts) 
                                              have now been fused with them into 
                                              a single court at the bottom of 
                                              the ladder of courts. But the 
                                              present district court is two 
                                              courts rolled up in one - and 
                                              distinguished into grades I and 
                                              II. This is unfortunate in two 
                                              respects. Firstly, it is 
                                              reminiscent of a continuing 
                                              cleavage between native courts and 
                                              British courts. Secondly, it 
                                              creates the impression of an 
                                              inferior and superior court 
                                              between the grade I and grade II 
                                              courts. This impression is 
                                              presently strengthened by the fact 
                                              that lay magistrates can try cases 
                                              only in grade II courts. It is 
                                              suggested that steps be taken 
                                              immediately to legislate for a 
                                              single gradeless district court.</span></p>

                                              Article 125(2) of the

                                              Republic provides nostalgically, 
                                              however, that “Citizens may

                                              the administration of justice

                                              seems a recipe for the revival of 
                                              native tribunals - institutions 
                                              that had been drained out of the 
                                              judicial system for more than 30 
                                              years now. If they should be 
                                              established, the question would 
                                              arise as to the level of the 
                                              courts’ hierarchy at which they 
                                              could be perched—either at the 
                                              same level as or below the 
                                              district courts grade II? Indeed, 
                                              a more fundamental question would 
                                              be whether such cluster and 
                                              proliferation at the bottom is 
                                              desirable. Article 126(1)(b) which 
                                              enumerates the courts forming the 
                                              corpus of the judiciary drops the 
                                              term “customary tribunals.” With 
                                              respect to the inferior courts, it 
                                              provides that they shall consist 
                                              of “such lower courts or tribunals 
                                              as Parliament may by law 
                                              establish.” Perhaps, articles 
                                              125(2) and 126(1), read together,

                                              One of the interesting 
                                              developments underway in the 
                                              personnel of the judiciary was the 
                                              gradual phasing-out of lay 
                                              magistrates who preside over some 
                                              of the district courts grade II. 
                                              The Korsah Commission of 1950 
                                              recommended the abolition of lay 
                                              magistrates. That the lay 
                                              magistrates continue to function 
                                              is clearly due to difficulties in 
                                              persuading trained lawyers to go 
                                              on the bench in the required 
                                              numbers. This clearly indicated 
                                              policy of abolishing adjudication 
                                              by lay persons in the regular 
                                              courts is laudable and obviously 
                                              progressive. The public tribunals 
                                              system as it currently operates, 
                                              is a substantial negation of this 
                                              policy. The principle of lay 
                                              judges has now been accepted for 
                                              the Regional Tribunal and any 
                                              lower tribunals which may be 
                                              established.146 In the opinion of 
                                              this writer, lay participation in 
                                              the superior courts should have

                                              Presumably, also, the special 
                                              public prosecutor, the assistant 
                                              special public prosecutor and the

                                              remain. The Constitution, 1992 of 
                                              the Fourth Republic says nothing 
                                              about them. Like the 
                                              Attorney-General and his staff, 
                                              the public prosecutors would not 
                                              constitute part of the personnel 
                                              of the courts. It is not clear 
                                              whether, in the Fourth Republic, 
                                              they would then become part of the 
                                              Attorney-General’s Department and 
                                              be controlled by the 
                                              Attorney-General. Whether or not 
                                              such control is exercised is, 
                                              however, an administrative matter 
                                              that does not concern the 
                                              structure of the courts or the 
                                              judiciary.</span></p>

                                              The creation of the public 
                                              tribunals has drawn mixed 
                                              reactions and much criticism. The 
                                              Ghana Bar Association is on record 
                                              as having advised its members to 
                                              refrain from appearing before 
                                              them. Opposition to the tribunals 
                                              lies in their short-shrift 
                                              procedures, trials in absentia, 
                                              stiff (purportedly deterrent) 
                                              sentences, undue control and 
                                              possible direction from the PNDC 
                                              as to the outcome of trials and a 
                                              feeling among the public that a 
                                              man, once accused, is guilty even 
                                              before he is heard. Opposition 
                                              revolved also around the separate 
                                              existence of the public tribunals, 
                                              totally independent of the regular 
                                              courts and wholly insulated from 
                                              the supervisory jurisdiction of 
                                              the superior courts in the 
                                              national system. The Committee of 
                                              Expects (Constitution) on proposal 
                                              for a Draft Constitution for Ghana 
                                              empanelled under PNDCL 252 
                                              deprecated the separate existence 
                                              of the tribunals and recommended 
                                              their abolition or integration 
                                              into the regular national courts 
                                              system.151 The latter alternative 
                                              has now been accepted by the 
                                              Consultative Assembly and indorsed 
                                              by the Ghanaian electorate in the 
                                              constitutional referendum of 28 
                                              April 1992. In the Fourth 
                                              Republic, therefore, the tribunals 
                                              will, up to the level of the High 
                                              Court, remain a system within a 
                                              system. In the view of this 
                                              writer, this symbiotic existence 
                                              is undesirable. If the numbers of 
                                              the regular courts are felt to be 
                                              inadequate, they can be added to. 
                                              If work in the regular courts is 
                                              lethargic because of their 
                                              procedures, the procedures can be 
                                              reviewed. In this regard, the 
                                              procedures now available to the 
                                              tribunals can be placed at the 
                                              disposal of numerically increased 
                                              regular courts. If the reasons for 
                                              the introduction of more lay 
                                              adjudicators is to inject into 
                                              decisions considerations of social 
                                              justice rather than strict 
                                              adherence to rules of substantive 
                                              law and procedure, the 
                                              requirements of the qualifications 
                                              for the personnel of the regular 
                                              courts can be correspondingly 
                                              amended. Courts enforce law, and 
                                              no regular court will refuse to 
                                              follow new rules of substantive 
                                              law and procedure if duly enjoined 
                                              to do so.</span></p>

                                              Another interesting observation is 
                                              that, in the Fourth Republic, the 
                                              tribunals will function merely as 
                                              special criminal divisions of the 
                                              regular courts of their respective 
                                              levels. Why then can they not 
                                              simply bear the names of the 
                                              regular courts at their levels? 
                                              The word “tribunal” means “a court 
                                              of justice.” So, why not maintain 
                                              consistency in nomenclature?</span></p>

                                              more courts and arbitral or 
                                              dispute settlement institutions. 
                                              As we have seen, five levels of 
                                              courts have grown up in response 
                                              to this need: these are (1) the 
                                              district courts; (2) the circuit 
                                              courts; (3) the High Court, (4) 
                                              the Court of Appeal; and (5) the 
                                              Supreme Court. A three-tier 
                                              appeals system exists within this 
                                              five-rung ladder of courts, that 
                                              is from the inferior courts to the 
                                              High Court, from the High Court to 
                                              the Court of Appeal and, finally 
                                              from the Court of Appeal to the 
                                              Supreme Court. It seems clearly a 
                                              case of unwarranted proliferation 
                                              and therefore undesirable to 
                                              further load up the bottom of all 
                                              this gradation with district,

                                              Fortunately, it is not mandatory 
                                              that Parliament establish these 
                                              lower tribunals; and it is 
                                              suggested that they should not be 
                                              established. The need to bring 
                                              justice to the doorsteps of the 
                                              people can be achieved by

                                              is what has been created under the 
                                              legislation referred to in note 
                                              144 above. But as the decision in 
                                              Yaro v Duho (supra) shows, the 
                                              High Court cannot even report the 
                                              case to the Chief Justice for 
                                              transfer to the appropriate 
                                              regional High Court if the 
                                              defendant promptly files an 
                                              objection to the jurisdiction of 
                                              the wrong regional High Court. It 
                                              is suggested that the present 
                                              legislation is too much weighted 
                                              in favour of the defendant. A 
                                              better provision would be to 
                                              permit the suit either in the 
                                              court of the region where the 
                                              plaintiff resides and does 
                                              business or in the court of the 
                                              region where the defendant resides 
                                              and does business. The plaintiff 
                                              would then have the discretion to 
                                              sue in any one, not both of 
                                              course, of the two places.</span></p>
