                                              Ghana, like most nations, is made 
                                              up of a number of ethnic 
                                              communities, each with its own 
                                              deep-rooted customary practices 
                                              and offences handed down from 
                                              generation to generation. Within a 
                                              particular tribe, there are as 
                                              many varied customs as there are 
                                              communities. Some of the customary 
                                              practices and offences are related 
                                              to the history of the founding

                                              lifetime of the people, others to 
                                              marriage and puberty rites of the 
                                              women, and others to the day to

                                              There are certain communities 
                                              where it is forbidden to work in 
                                              the farms on certain days; where 
                                              certain animals are not to be 
                                              reared; where the eating of yams,

                                              music are forbidden at certain 
                                              periods of the year. In certain 
                                              parts of the Volta Region, for 
                                              example, it is a punishable 
                                              customary offence to invoke a 
                                              fetish on another person without 
                                              the prior consent of the chief of 
                                              the community; again where a 
                                              person is accused of using juju to 
                                              kill someone, and the person 
                                              accused refuses to undergo a trial 
                                              by ordeal to prove his innocence, 
                                              he is subjected to heavy customary 
                                              sanctions.1 It is also a serious 
                                              customary offence in Kadjebi area 
                                              for anyone to collect stone 
                                              particles in front and around the 
                                              palace of the chief.2 Among the 
                                              Krobos, it is an unpardonable 
                                              customary offence for a female who 
                                              reaches the age of puberty to 
                                              become pregnant if she had not 
                                              gone through a customary rite 
                                              called &quot;dipo.&quot; Such a female is

                                              but she is liable to be banished 
                                              from home and disowned by her 
                                              parents.3</span></p>

                                              In almost every community, it is a 
                                              serious customary offence for 
                                              anyone to commit adultery. And 
                                              Taylor J (as he then was) in Billa 
                                              v Salifu4 pointed out four 
                                              categories of adultery in Dagomba 
                                              custom, viz first, taking 
                                              someone's wife away and carnally 
                                              knowing her; secondly, carnally 
                                              knowing someone's pregnant wife; 
                                              thirdly, carnally knowing 
                                              someone's wife whose newly born 
                                              child is dead; and finally, 
                                              carnally knowing a woman who since 
                                              her delivery had not slept with 
                                              her husband. The rationale

                                              offences is easily discernible 
                                              while others defy any intelligible 
                                              rationalisation.</span></p>

                                              of a traditional area lost his 
                                              mother. He asked a carpenter to 
                                              make a fitting coffin for her 
                                              burial. The carpenter built a 
                                              beautiful coffin and submitted his 
                                              bill. A year after the burial of 
                                              the woman, when the carpenter 
                                              realised that the chief was not 
                                              making any effort to settle the 
                                              bill, he called on him at his 
                                              palace and respectfully demanded 
                                              his money. The chief who was at 
                                              that time with his linguist and 
                                              few friends, immediately retired 
                                              with his linguist for 
                                              consultation. They returned and 
                                              the linguist informed the 
                                              carpenter that his demand had 
                                              reminded the chief of the death of 
                                              his mother, and thus caused grief 
                                              to him. He went on to inform the 
                                              carpenter that such a conduct was 
                                              a serious customary offence, and 
                                              therefore he was liable to provide 
                                              six bottles of schnapps, a carton 
                                              of minerals, a sheep, tubers of 
                                              yam and ¢5,000 cash. 
                                              Notwithstanding all pleadings from 
                                              the carpenter that he was not 
                                              aware of any such customary 
                                              offence and that his intention was 
                                              not to cause such grief, he was 
                                              ordered to go and bring the items 
                                              before his bill would be 
                                              considered. The carpenter 
                                              immediately ran to my chambers for 
                                              legal advice since he felt that 
                                              the alleged custom, if it existed 
                                              was oppressive. The letter written 
                                              to demand the settlement of the 
                                              bill quickly cautioned the chief 
                                              to settle same without demanding 
                                              the fines for the alleged 
                                              customary offence. Indeed the 
                                              settlement of the bill prevented 
                                              me from issuing a writ to 
                                              determine how far such a customary 
                                              offence could aid the chief in 
                                              refusing to settle the carpenter's 
                                              bill. It would have been 
                                              interesting for the issue to be 
                                              determined as to whether a court 
                                              could have ordered the chief to 
                                              settle the bill and at the same 
                                              time ordered the carpenter to 
                                              provide the items imposed on him 
                                              as fines for the breach of that 
                                              alleged custom.</span></p>

                                              Now the object of this paper is 
                                              not to embark upon a critical 
                                              examination of these customs and 
                                              their offences with a view to 
                                              determining their validity. Our 
                                              task is to examine the 
                                              jurisdiction and attitude of the 
                                              courts when they, ie the courts, 
                                              are called upon to punish or 
                                              indorse the punishment meted out 
                                              to those alleged to be in breach 
                                              of these customary practices. In 
                                              other words, to what extent are 
                                              the courts prepared to assume 
                                              jurisdiction, when called upon to 
                                              do so, to enforce or not to

                                              practices? It will in this regard 
                                              be instructive, to look briefly at

                                              Before the introduction of British

                                              or kings held the supreme power

                                              from physical and spiritual 
                                              invaders. In consultation with

                                              were tried before a tribunal of

                                              Effee7 the defendant was accused 
                                              of having charged the plaintiff 
                                              with practising witchcraft and 
                                              with having thereby caused the 
                                              death of a child. The plaintiff 
                                              partially succeeded in proving his 
                                              case and the defendant was fined 
                                              and ordered to pay costs. The 
                                              defendant was further ordered that 
                                              neither he nor his family should 
                                              trouble the plaintiff in future 
                                              under a penalty of four ounces of 
                                              gold. In Beddomassoo v Bossoo,8 
                                              the defendant was accused of going 
                                              to the house where one of the 
                                              plaintiff's captains stopped, and 
                                              called down a fetish to kill the 
                                              plaintiff. The court found this to 
                                              be a serious customary offence and 
                                              accordingly found him guilty and 
                                              was fined four acks with costs.</span></p>

                                              replaced in 1883 by another

                                              1883 Ordinance gave chiefs of 
                                              specified status power to create 
                                              bye-laws, breaches of which they 
                                              had jurisdiction to try as 
                                              criminal offences. Ordinance No 7 
                                              of 1910 amending the 1883 
                                              Ordinance, made the Native

                                              Following the political 
                                              disturbances in 1948 the Watson 
                                              Commission was appointed to 
                                              inquire into the situation. The 
                                              commission recommended that there 
                                              should be constitutional reforms. 
                                              The Coussey Committee which 
                                              undertook the task recommended the 
                                              development of local 
                                              administration and further pointed 
                                              out some defects in the native 
                                              courts' system. The Sir Arku 
                                              Korsah Commission which was 
                                              subsequently tasked with the 
                                              examination of the native courts' 
                                              system, recommended the setting up 
                                              of local courts. And the Local 
                                              Courts Act, 195814 was accordingly 
                                              passed to implement Korsah's 
                                              recommendation. The 1958 Local 
                                              Court Act abolished the native 
                                              tribunals and in their place 
                                              created a number of local courts 
                                              presided over not by chiefs any

                                              Local Government took over the

                                              which stripped the chiefs of their

                                              traditional rulers lost completely 
                                              all their ancient powers and

                                              superseded by the Chieftaincy Act, 
                                              1961 (Act 81) which consolidated

                                              relating to chieftaincy. Act 81 
                                              took pains to ensure that the 
                                              tribunals created under it, did

                                              It is therefore clear that the

                                              traditional rulers have since 1958 
                                              been confined to determining

                                              no institution of the State nor

                                              Constitution, 1969 and the 
                                              Constitution, 1979 gave power to 
                                              Parliament to establish such

                                              established. If such courts had 
                                              been established, they might 
                                              naturally have been the 
                                              appropriate courts to take over

                                              Constitution, 1992 does not talk 
                                              of establishing traditional 
                                              courts, but it gives Parliament 
                                              power in article 126(b) to 
                                              establish such lower courts and

                                              However, we must point out that 
                                              the various Chieftaincy Acts did 
                                              not deprive our traditional rulers 
                                              of their customary authority to 
                                              arbitrate in disputes. Thus 
                                              section 5 of Act 81 for example 
                                              provided:</span></p>

                                              extra-judicially as an arbitrator 
                                              under customary law in any dispute 
                                              in respect of which the parties 
                                              thereto consent to his so acting 
                                              is hereby preserved.&quot;16a</span></p>

                                              We do not have the above provision 
                                              in either the Houses of Chiefs 
                                              Act, 1958 nor the present Act 370. 
                                              But the power mentioned in section 
                                              5 of Act 81 is not exclusively 
                                              confined to the institution of 
                                              chieftaincy alone but extends to 
                                              every individual who agrees to 
                                              adjudicate on a dispute between 
                                              parties who have voluntarily 
                                              consented to that effect. Thus its 
                                              absence in Act 370 will not 
                                              disable&nbsp; any chief from so acting

                                              do so by the litigants. Indeed the 
                                              power of a chief to act as an 
                                              arbitrator when so requested was 
                                              regarded as part of the inherent 
                                              customary functions of a chief 
                                              during the passing of Act 370. For

                                              &quot;I would like to demonstrate this 
                                              distinction between customary 
                                              functions and statutory functions 
                                              with a few examples. Pouring

                                              important festivals, serving as

                                              disputes, receiving customary

                                              and performing all religious 
                                              duties incidental to chieftaincy 
                                              are functions which lie 
                                              exclusively within the province of 
                                              customary law. But exercising 
                                              appellate jurisdiction over

                                              law. No paramount chief has 
                                              appellate jurisdiction over 
                                              another paramount stool. The only 
                                              basis for the exercise of such 
                                              appellate jurisdiction is the 
                                              Constitution and statute.&quot;17</span></p>

                                              But this power to act as a

                                              in breach of customary practices. 
                                              For from the language of section 5 
                                              of Act 81 and a long line of 
                                              respectable authorities, no one 
                                              can be forced to submit to the 
                                              jurisdiction of any arbitrator. 
                                              Therefore for any fine or award 
                                              made at such an arbitration to be 
                                              enforceable, it must be proved 
                                              that the parties voluntarily

                                              There is certainly an air of 
                                              oddity surrounding a suggestion 
                                              that a chief sitting as a 
                                              customary arbitrator can 
                                              legitimately try and punish a 
                                              customary offender. Which offender 
                                              would voluntarily offer himself to 
                                              be punished? How fair would the 
                                              chief and his elders be in view of 
                                              the fact that they are the 
                                              custodians and guardians of the 
                                              alleged custom? The obvious 
                                              likelihood of the chief and his 
                                              elders being the prosecutors and 
                                              judges at such an arbitration are 
                                              so glaring as to vitiate the award 
                                              of the arbitration. For an 
                                              arbitration proceeding must

                                              explained that he was going to use 
                                              them in manufacturing grinding 
                                              stones. He was reported to the 
                                              linguist of the paramount chief 
                                              and &quot;arrested&quot; in the customary 
                                              manner and brought before the 
                                              paramount chief and his elders on 
                                              the ground that his conduct in 
                                              collecting the stone particles 
                                              from the street in front of the 
                                              paramount chief's palace was 
                                              against custom. And 
                                              notwithstanding his explanation 
                                              that he was not aware of any such 
                                              custom and that he was going to 
                                              use the stone particles in 
                                              manufacturing grinding stones for 
                                              a living, the paramount chief and 
                                              his elders found his conduct to be 
                                              in breach of the custom and fined 
                                              him four bottles of schnapps, one 
                                              live sheep and a pot of palm wine.</span></p>

                                              The quantity of stones he was 
                                              alleged to have collected was not 
                                              produced. In fact, he was alleged 
                                              to have abandoned the stones he 
                                              was collecting. Yaw Debrah found 
                                              the rationale underlying the fines 
                                              difficult to appreciate and so he 
                                              refused to pay them. All attempts 
                                              by the elders to get him pay the 
                                              fines after the proceeding proved 
                                              futile. And so he was reported to 
                                              the police. The police charged him 
                                              with the offence of disrespect to 
                                              a chief contrary to section 53(a) 
                                              of Act 370, and arraigned him 
                                              before the Magistrate Court Grade 
                                              1, Kadjebi. The chief alleged to 
                                              have been insulted was the 
                                              paramount chief who sat with his 
                                              elders, tried and imposed the 
                                              fines on him. At the trial the 
                                              police did not know which conduct 
                                              of the accused constituted 
                                              disrespectful conduct. The police 
                                              investigator was asked in 
                                              cross-examination:</span></p>

                                              because of his refusal to pay the

                                              said proceedings. But it was quite 
                                              glaring from the record of 
                                              proceedings that the appellant, 
                                              apart from collecting stone

                                              during the alleged arbitration. 
                                              However he did indicate after the 
                                              fines were imposed that he did not 
                                              see his way clear in paying the 
                                              fines, and consequently refused to 
                                              pay the fines. But he was indeed 
                                              reported to the police because the 
                                              chief and his elders were peeved 
                                              at his refusal to pay the fines, 
                                              and they hoped that the police 
                                              intervention would bring fear into 
                                              him to pay the fines. Yaw Deborah

                                              But assuming that the proceedings 
                                              were customary arbitration, does 
                                              its enforcement consist in 
                                              reporting the appellant to the 
                                              police? Certainly not. Who was the 
                                              complainant with whom he 
                                              voluntarily submitted to the

                                              where the chief and his elders

                                              at the same time? This case 
                                              clearly demonstrates the legal

                                              As pointed out earlier on, the 
                                              position after 1966 is that the 
                                              customary offences which were 
                                              within the jurisdiction of the 
                                              native courts and later the local 
                                              courts, were not retained in our 
                                              statute books to be tried and 
                                              punished by an individual nor the 
                                              present courts. The only customary 
                                              offence which is still found in a 
                                              statute is that of disrespect of a 
                                              chief, found in section 53(a)of 
                                              Act 370. But then we all know that 
                                              day in and day out, at the 
                                              self-created tribunals of our 
                                              traditional rulers and elders, the 
                                              citizens are punished for various 
                                              customary offences as it happened 
                                              in Yaw Debrah's case. The 
                                              punishment imposed on the 
                                              offenders are sometimes so harsh 
                                              and out of proportion to the 
                                              offence. The punishment takes the 
                                              form of fines of a certain number 
                                              of schnapps, sheep, foodstuffs and 
                                              money. And sometimes the offender 
                                              is banished from the locality.</span></p>

                                              made up of various ethnic 
                                              communities traditionally brought 
                                              up along their own peculiar 
                                              customs and practices. The impact 
                                              of colonial administration and way

                                              Thus the institution of 
                                              chieftaincy for example had been

                                              chieftaincy is so closely bound up 
                                              with the life of our communities 
                                              that its disappearance would spell 
                                              disaster. Chiefs and what they 
                                              symbolize in the society are so 
                                              vital that the subject of their

                                              greatest caution. No African of

                                              admiration for the best aspects of 
                                              chieftaincy and all would loathe 
                                              to do violence to it any more than

                                              there have been, but none coming 
                                              from responsible people whom we 
                                              have known or met is directed 
                                              towards the complete effacement of

                                              We cannot therefore pretend not to 
                                              appreciate that our chiefs, like 
                                              the central government, must in 
                                              the exercise of their traditional 
                                              functions, have some authority to 
                                              maintain their dignity, and demand 
                                              punishment of those found to be in 
                                              violation of the various customs 
                                              and practices which they 
                                              superintend. Hence the claim to 
                                              inherent authority of chiefs to 
                                              try and punish violations of 
                                              customary practices. And this is 
                                              the reason why those who are 
                                              punished at the various tribunals 
                                              of our chiefs, in reverence to the 
                                              chief, obediently comply with the 
                                              terms of the punishment, although, 
                                              as we have shown above, there is 
                                              no statutory justification for 
                                              such punishments. The courts are 
                                              therefore impotent to accept and 
                                              enforce such punishments.</span></p>

                                              faulty. For whereas a chief is 
                                              installed by his subjects who have 
                                              a right to destool him, a parent 
                                              is not installed nor created by 
                                              his children. Furthermore, whereas 
                                              the right of a parent to punish 
                                              his children has statutory 
                                              recognition and justification 
                                              under section 31(i) of Act 29, the 
                                              right of a chief to punish his 
                                              subjects has no such statutory 
                                              recognition. Nowhere under section 
                                              31 of Act 29 is force justified if

                                              has violated any customary

                                              The principle surfaces in various

                                              principles of human rights, and is 
                                              further enshrined in the criminal

                                              stands with regard to the criminal 
                                              law; otherwise to punish him for

                                              cruelty. Punishment in all its

                                              offence is derived from the

                                              could be legislated for all the 
                                              country. In the Colony and 
                                              Southern Section of Togoland, 
                                              seven such offences were specified 
                                              in the Schedules to the 
                                              Ordinances. For the native courts 
                                              in Ashanti and the Northern 
                                              Territories, the Governor had to 
                                              specify in an order, the native 
                                              customary offences which the 
                                              courts were empowered to handle. 
                                              The local courts which replaced 
                                              the native courts were empowered 
                                              to handle only three of the 
                                              previous customary offences - 
                                              which have already been set out 
                                              above. A single enactment setting 
                                              out uniform customary offences and 
                                              their punishments for the entire 
                                              nation, therefore, is a difficult

                                              Thus the solution lies first, in 
                                              the making of bye-laws by the 
                                              various district assemblies on 
                                              what constitutes customary

                                              from a few district councils 
                                              whether there are bye-laws on the 
                                              various bans imposed in the

                                              assigned to the district. And the 
                                              councils can, in pursuance of 
                                              these objectives, enact the

                                              The second mode of achieving 
                                              codification is that a traditional

                                              The procedure as set out in the 
                                              relevant sections are simple: Each 
                                              traditional council is empowered 
                                              to consider the customary rule of

                                              if that rule of practice is 
                                              uncertain or it is considered 
                                              desirable to be modified, the 
                                              council must make proposals to its 
                                              regional house of chiefs which 
                                              shall study the proposals and 
                                              forward same to the National House

                                              them if necessary. The National

                                              in pursuance of these provisions 
                                              of Act 370 have yielded no

                                              the olden days. Barrenness in

                                              real purpose. First, the 
                                              authorities who would codify the 
                                              said offences would satisfy 
                                              themselves that the said offences 
                                              are in line with the general law 
                                              of the land. Secondly, the 
                                              codification itself would satisfy 
                                              the requirements of section 8 of 
                                              Act 29 and thereby afford every 
                                              citizen the opportunity to know 
                                              beforehand the nature and 
                                              punishment for such an offence. 
                                              For once our various communities 
                                              are no longer inhabited solely by 
                                              the indigenous people but also by 
                                              others who are compelled by 
                                              national assignments and other 
                                              vocations, there is the need for 
                                              some certainty in what is and what 
                                              is not an offence in the area.</span></p>

                                              We have so far dealt with the 
                                              subject as if it is only through 
                                              the criminal jurisdiction of the 
                                              courts that breaches of customary 
                                              practices can be remedied. But 
                                              just as a stealing case can be the 
                                              subject matter of a civil action 
                                              for conversion, so can a person 
                                              who is affected or feels aggrieved 
                                              by any breach of customary 
                                              practice institute an action for 
                                              compensation, declaration or any 
                                              appropriate relief. And of course 
                                              in a civil suit there is no need 
                                              for the codification of the 
                                              customary practice in question. 
                                              What is important in such a civil 
                                              suit is for the plaintiff to 
                                              succeed in proving his case or the 
                                              defendant in establishing his 
                                              defence. Let us take the example 
                                              of a community which believes that 
                                              it is a taboo for a man to grow 
                                              beard and that any man who 
                                              violates this taboo would have to 
                                              provide drinks and sheep to pacify 
                                              the gods. Mr A, a bearded man, had 
                                              just been transferred to the 
                                              community. He is approached by the 
                                              elders of the community to shave 
                                              his beard but he refuses. An elder 
                                              of the community who stays with 
                                              this man in the house believing 
                                              that his refusal to shave is a bad 
                                              omen to his household, issues a 
                                              writ at the court claiming an 
                                              order to compel Mr A to shave his 
                                              beard,&nbsp; ¢100,000 damages for 
                                              breach of a customary practice, an 
                                              injunction restraining him from 
                                              further growing beard and so on. 
                                              Are the courts bound to award the 
                                              elder his reliefs if he succeeds 
                                              in proving his claim? To answer 
                                              this question let us look at one 
                                              or two relevant decided cases.</span></p>

                                              In Abaye v Akatia29 the

                                              backyard garden were destroyed by 
                                              the defendants during the funeral 
                                              rites of the Tufuhene of the area. 
                                              It was an accepted custom in the 
                                              area that whenever a Tufuhene died 
                                              the people while performing the 
                                              customary funeral rites could go 
                                              on a rampage slaughtering goats, 
                                              sheep and destroying food crops 
                                              grown in the backyard of houses. 
                                              The trial magistrate found that 
                                              the custom was an established one 
                                              in the area and dismissed the 
                                              plaintiff's claim. On appeal to 
                                              the High Court, the plaintiff 
                                              argued that the alleged customary 
                                              practice was illegal and obnoxious 
                                              and therefore unenforceable. The 
                                              High Court dismissed same, holding 
                                              that any required change in the 
                                              custom was to be effected by those 
                                              who practised it and not by the 
                                              court. His lordship said30a:</span></p>

                                              conduct a research into the 
                                              time-honoured practices in order

                                              The court obviously had in mind

                                              of Act 370 which empower 
                                              traditional councils to make 
                                              representations for a change or

                                              at that time was a question of 
                                              fact and its enforceability by the

                                              But since 1960 such customary 
                                              rules of practice are part of the

                                              a question of fact. And the test 
                                              of equity, natural justice and 
                                              good conscience which they had to

                                              justice and good conscience used 
                                              in the colonial and pre-Republican 
                                              days for measuring their validity 
                                              were not re-enacted after their 
                                              repeal. Obviously our Republican 
                                              legislature must have considered 
                                              these colonial yardsticks as an 
                                              affront to the integrity of our 
                                              customary laws and not in keeping 
                                              with the dignity of a modern 
                                              sovereign state. As a result after 
                                              1 July 1960, the customary laws of 
                                              the various tribal communities 
                                              became part of the law of the 
                                              country and the only test for 
                                              their validity is whether they 
                                              fulfil those conditions which 
                                              under the general law of Ghana 
                                              must be satisfied by all customary 
                                              laws.&quot;</span></p>

                                              satisfied? Certainly the customary 
                                              rule must not be inconsistent with 
                                              the general law. Thus where the 
                                              general law forbids an intentional 
                                              killing of a human being on

                                              of Act 29, and a rule of customary 
                                              practice in a particular community 
                                              sanctions an intentional killing 
                                              of any woman who has grown hairs 
                                              on her chin, it is doubtful 
                                              whether notwithstanding the fact 
                                              that rules of customary practices 
                                              are part of the law of the land, 
                                              such a customary rule would be 
                                              accepted by the courts as part of 
                                              the customary law of Ghana.</span></p>

                                              to Grunshie custom, an adulterer 
                                              is entitled to institute 
                                              proceedings to claim the child of 
                                              the adulterous union . . . Such an 
                                              action by an adulterer is no doubt 
                                              contrary to public morality and 
                                              decency but I would venture to 
                                              suggest that if the categories of 
                                              public policy are not yet closed, 
                                              such an action is clearly contrary 
                                              to public policy that unashamed 
                                              adulterers should be permitted by 
                                              the courts to demonstrate without 
                                              any sense of compunction their

                                              are in conformity with the general 
                                              law of the land, and that they

                                              respectful view that when the High

                                              Thus in the problem posed earlier 
                                              on, there is no doubt that the 
                                              landlord's claim against Mr A is 
                                              one touching on the fundamental 
                                              rights of Mr A in deciding to grow 
                                              or not to grow a beard. And since 
                                              it is one of the national 
                                              aspirations of the government to 
                                              protect such fundamental liberties

                                              landlord's action appears to be in

                                              A's beard is a breach of the 
                                              customary practice, the landlord

                                              We began by alluding to the fact 
                                              that there are numerous ethnic 
                                              communities with their varied 
                                              tribal taboos and offences in this 
                                              country. Some of these taboos have 
                                              laudable objectives, others have 
                                              been demonstrated by scientific 
                                              researches to be based on 
                                              ignorance and therefore not worthy 
                                              of commendation. For example, the 
                                              Krobo custom of &quot;dipo&quot; is aimed at 
                                              ensuring that girls lead virtuous 
                                              lives before they reach the age of 
                                              puberty. And in the face of the 
                                              present campaign against 
                                              promiscuous sexual practices to 
                                              stop the spread of the AIDS 
                                              epidemic, no custom can be more in 
                                              keeping with such a national 
                                              objective than the &quot;dipo&quot; custom. 
                                              However one wonders whether the 
                                              harsh punishment for its breach is 
                                              realistic and in accord with the 
                                              fundamental right of the girls 
                                              concerned.</span></p>

                                              On the other hand, the custom of 
                                              female circumcision practised in a 
                                              number of communities is severely

                                              the females. To what extent then, 
                                              should the court be prepared to

                                              custom if a female refuses to be 
                                              circumcised in such a community? 
                                              As already pointed out, it is not 
                                              the duty of the courts to change 
                                              customs. It is for the elders and 
                                              traditional rulers who insist on 
                                              compliance with these customs to 
                                              be alive to the truth that society

                                              ordeal at a fetish shrine and was 
                                              exonerated, the community refused 
                                              to accept the result. The accused 
                                              finding the reaction of the 
                                              community to his acquittal very 
                                              hostile took action at the High 
                                              Court against the chiefs of the 
                                              community for damages for 
                                              defamation and malicious 
                                              prosecution. The particulars of 
                                              the malicious prosecution being 
                                              that he was maliciously prosecuted 
                                              before the fetish shrine by the 
                                              chiefs, and that since he had been 
                                              acquitted at the said trial, he 
                                              was entitled to damages for his 
                                              prosecution. The High Court was 
                                              therefore called upon to examine, 
                                              inter alia, whether in the face of 
                                              our modern notions of fair trial, 
                                              a trial by ordeal was one which 
                                              deserved the recognition of the 
                                              courts so as to enable the 
                                              plaintiff to be entitled to his 
                                              damages for malicious

                                              The Constitution, 1992 of the

                                              far-reaching provisions which are 
                                              bound to punctuate the enforcement 
                                              of most customary practices and 
                                              offences. Article 1(2) of the 
                                              Constitution unambiguously lays it

                                              supreme law of the land and any 
                                              other law (which of course 
                                              includes customary laws) found to

                                              that this constitutional provision 
                                              at once cast into a crucible . . . 
                                              all the laws of the land and 
                                              subjected them to the test of 
                                              constitutional propriety. All 
                                              those that failed the test became 
                                              void and the task of an 
                                              interpreter and therefore of a 
                                              Ghanaian judge became to some 
                                              extent simplified: It is to search 
                                              in the crucible for the relevant 
                                              remnants of the inconsistent 
                                              provisions so that he can refuse 
                                              to give effect to them. Thus the 
                                              concept of legislative supremacy, 
                                              which necessarily colours judicial

                                              hardly apply here. Our legislature

                                              our courts must bow as well to our

                                              are chapters 5 and 6. Chapter 5

                                              rights and freedoms, while chapter 
                                              6 deals with the Directive 
                                              Principles of State Policy. 
                                              Article 12 enjoins all persons in

                                              legislature and judiciary to

                                              liberty and property, equality

                                              conviction of any person of a

                                              For if after 1960 the court did 
                                              not have power to pass judgment on 
                                              the validity of such practices, as 
                                              contended in Abaye v Akatia 
                                              (supra), there is no doubt that 
                                              under the Fourth Republican 
                                              Constitution, 1992, the courts 
                                              have been given ample authority 
                                              not only to declare a customary 
                                              practice as invalid, but also to 
                                              order its abolition. Society is 
                                              dynamic and such provisions are 
                                              necessary to enable the rejection 
                                              of archaic and obsolete customs 
                                              with a view to keeping pace with 
                                              the ever changing patterns of 
                                              development.</span></p>

                                              It is however gratifying to note 
                                              that our chiefs were among the 
                                              category of persons who had the 
                                              greatest number of representatives 
                                              at the Consultative Assembly which 
                                              drafted the Constitution, 1992. 
                                              Their knowledge of the provisions 
                                              of chapters 5 and 6 is thus 
                                              presumed. And it behoves our 
                                              chiefs to ensure that the 
                                              provisions of the said chapters 
                                              are respected and applied to all 
                                              citizens not only by the central 
                                              government but also by them in 
                                              their dealings with their 
                                              subjects. The chief and his elders 
                                              forming the traditional government 
                                              in our various localities are, 
                                              like the central government, bound 
                                              by the provisions of the 
                                              Constitution. This Constitution 
                                              has received the widest publicity 
                                              in the rural areas than any 
                                              previous Constitution of this 
                                              country. It has been simplified 
                                              for the understanding of the 
                                              ordinary man. It has also been 
                                              translated into various local 
                                              languages for the benefit of those 
                                              who cannot read English. The 
                                              public's awareness of their rights 
                                              under the Constitution cannot thus 
                                              be underrated. Any attempt 
                                              therefore to subject individuals 
                                              to obnoxious and unhealthy 
                                              customary practices, are likely to 
                                              be resisted in the courts.</span></p>

                                              The fundamental human rights 
                                              guaranteed in the Constitution, 
                                              1992 are neither novel nor too 
                                              difficult to be respected. They 
                                              are rights which had had their 
                                              beginnings from the days of the 
                                              great Biblical prophets. When 
                                              Moses brought the Ten Commandments 
                                              down from Mount Sinai, he 
                                              published to his tribes not only 
                                              commandments against wrongdoing 
                                              but a proclamation of fundamental 
                                              rights. Apart from the 
                                              commandments relating to the 
                                              deity, the following related to 
                                              man: Thou shalt not kill; Thou 
                                              shalt not steal; Thou shalt not 
                                              bear false witness; Thou shalt not 
                                              covert thy neighbour's house nor 
                                              his wife, nor his manservant, nor 
                                              his maidservant nor his cattle, 
                                              nor any of his things. In other 
                                              words everyone is entitled to be 
                                              free from arbitrary and unlawful 
                                              interference.</span></p>

                                              But one of the areas where the 
                                              fundamental rights of citizens of 
                                              this nation are much abused is in 
                                              the arbitrary sanctions and 
                                              punishments imposed for breaches 
                                              of alleged customary offences. 
                                              This may be due to the fact that 
                                              some of our chiefs believe that 
                                              they still possess the ancient 
                                              powers of their predecessors to 
                                              adjudicate and impose punishments 
                                              on their subjects. But we have 
                                              demonstrated in this paper that 
                                              apart from the power to adjudicate 
                                              in chieftaincy disputes, they were 
                                              rid of all such powers as far back 
                                              as 1958. The Constitution, 1992 is 
                                              an emphatic road-block to the 
                                              exercise of any such arbitrary 
                                              power. Its provisions on the 
                                              individual rights and freedoms 
                                              create moral, social and legal 
                                              obligations on our traditional

                                              dealings with their subjects, and
