                                              Kofi Tetteh, then Editor of the 
                                              Ghana Law Reports, who in a report 
                                              which he submitted to the General 
                                              Legal Council spelled out the 
                                              problems facing law reporting in 
                                              Ghana and indicated possible 
                                              solutions. He subsequently 
                                              published it as an article.4 In 
                                              that article, he succeeded in 
                                              demonstrating in an overwhelmingly 
                                              convincing manner the need for the 
                                              establishment of a Council for Law 
                                              Reporting in Ghana. In further 
                                              effort, he succeeded in pressing 
                                              the then Attorney-General, Mr 
                                              Victor Owusu, to prevail on the

                                              the idea. His tenacity bore fruit

                                              have deliberately drawn attention 
                                              to these reports as a preface and 
                                              an introduction to my discussion 
                                              of the doctrine of judicial 
                                              precedent in Ghana. I have done 
                                              this because any meaningful 
                                              exposition of the application of 
                                              the doctrine is predicated on the 
                                              reporting of cases and the 
                                              availability of such reports. It 
                                              is not just the reporting of a 
                                              single case on a matter or an 
                                              issue but rather the reporting of 
                                              a series of cases on the matter or 
                                              the issue, with such cases 
                                              illustrating a relevant rule of 
                                              law running through the cases and 
                                              applicable logically without 
                                              straining their import to the 
                                              matter or the issue. And the rule 
                                              of law so identified and 
                                              illuminated must be in accordance

                                              principles which inform the common

                                              The concept of stare decisis is 
                                              therefore merely a rule or maxim 
                                              which many persons on occasions 
                                              find convenient and indeed feel 
                                              constrained by the logic of a 
                                              particular situation to resort to 
                                              in resolving problems. Clearly, 
                                              although the terms judicial 
                                              precedent and stare decisis are 
                                              often interchanged in the 
                                              nomenclature of legal writers, it 
                                              would seem that the terms are 
                                              inherently not identical. Implicit 
                                              in my approach is a dichotomy of 
                                              the rule of stare decisis and the 
                                              doctrine of judicial precedent. 
                                              Stare decisis I perceive as a 
                                              general philosophical concept 
                                              embodying a normal human tendency 
                                              which can be said to be a rule or 
                                              tool of universal application in 
                                              the reasoning process of mankind.

                                              concept and a particular and

                                              Precedents serve to illustrate

                                              In 1859 the date of Beamish v 
                                              Beamish, the Supreme Court 
                                              Ordinances of 1853 and 1856 had 
                                              already been passed and the 
                                              judicial assessors were 
                                              endeavouring to dispense justice 
                                              in the English fashion30 and they 
                                              continued to do so31 until the 
                                              Supreme Court Ordinance 1876 came 
                                              into force. Although the basis of 
                                              their jurisdiction is not very 
                                              clear, it must be remembered that 
                                              Beamish v Beamish was decided 15 
                                              years after the Bond of 6 March 
                                              1844. By the terms of the Bond 
                                              some of the chiefs of the country 
                                              accepted for themselves and their 
                                              subjects, the jurisdiction of 
                                              Queen of Great Britain and Ireland 
                                              within their various territories. 
                                              They in fact specifically conceded 
                                              to the British Crown the power of 
                                              moulding the customs of the 
                                              country to the general principles 
                                              of British law.32 It will be 
                                              recalled that the doctrine of 
                                              judicial precedent as propounded 
                                              by Lord Campbell LC was a 
                                              fundamental general principle of 
                                              British law and he specifically 
                                              indicated that the doctrine was 
                                              applicable to the British Empire.</span></p>

                                              &quot;. . . I am prepared to say... 
                                              that a decision of this House once 
                                              given upon a point of law is 
                                              conclusive upon this House 
                                              afterwards, and that it is 
                                              impossible to raise that question 
                                              again as if it were res integra 
                                              and could be reargued, and so the 
                                              house be asked to reverse it’s own 
                                              decision. That is a principle 
                                              which has been, I believe, without 
                                              any real decision to the contrary, 
                                              established now for some

                                              Earlier in his speech Lord 
                                              Halsbury had considered the 
                                              situation where a decision of the 
                                              House of Lords had been given in 
                                              ignorance of a statute relevant to 
                                              the ratio of the decision. He 
                                              proffered the answer that this 
                                              would be a mistake of fact and 
                                              that the decision founded on such 
                                              a mistake would not be binding. It 
                                              would seem however that until it 
                                              is reversed, such a decision will 
                                              bind the parties to the suit and 
                                              those claiming through them in 
                                              view of the principle of res 
                                              judicata. However, under the 
                                              principle derivable from English

                                              in the celebrated case of Mosi v

                                              positions. In his study of this 
                                              English doctrine, Sir John 
                                              Salmond45 draws a sharp 
                                              significant distinction between 
                                              declaratory and creative 
                                              precedents. A declaratory 
                                              precedent under his classification 
                                              is one that a court had applied in 
                                              fact situations of past cases, 
                                              which are similar to the case in 
                                              hand. A creative precedent on the 
                                              other hand is one which having 
                                              regard to the logic of the 
                                              situation and other legal and 
                                              non-legal but pertinent 
                                              considerations in the instant

                                              for the first time to the fact 
                                              situation in the instant case. A 
                                              declaratory precedent is therefore 
                                              applied because it is a precedent 
                                              controlling the instant case. A

                                              a potential precedent for future

                                              and which the Privy Council with

                                              than to encapsulate in a neat and

                                              the old principle was being 
                                              abandoned for a novel principle. 
                                              The only reference was article 42 
                                              (2) which was the constitutional

                                              one would think a new legal order

                                              set in. One school of thought took 
                                              the view that at the time of the 
                                              Republican Constitution our 
                                              superior courts were bound &quot;to the

                                              matter has created some unresolved 
                                              and needless doubts. The problem

                                              The above opinion of Justice 
                                              Ollennu has been criticised by Dr 
                                              Asante on the grounds that the 
                                              wording of article 42 (4) is 
                                              against the Ollennu position.70 
                                              This criticism seems to find 
                                              support in the views of Bennion 
                                              and Justice Azu Crabbe71 and in a

                                              controversy regarding the 
                                              application or non-application of 
                                              the doctrine of judicial precedent

                                              because the authority of a

                                              declaratory precedent, is founded

                                              It seems the 1960 position 
                                              reflected the English practice as 
                                              at that date. This was the 
                                              apparently rigid principle 
                                              enunciated in rather peremptory 
                                              language by the two Lord 
                                              Chancellors in Beamish v Beamish97

                                              case98 respectively, but which was 
                                              competently explained by Parke J 
                                              in Mirehouse v Rennell.99 The 
                                              apparent conflicting 
                                              pronouncements of the English 
                                              courts are explicable on the 
                                              simple ground that in fact the 
                                              doctrine is not and has not been 
                                              all that rigid. Indeed, when Parke 
                                              J formulated it in 1833 he 
                                              specifically indicated that the 
                                              legal rules which qualify as 
                                              judicial precedents are only 
                                              applicable&quot; where they are not

                                              of Parke J, it will be recalled 
                                              that in the London Street 
                                              Tramways100 case Lord Halsbury 
                                              suggested that a decision given by 
                                              the House of Lords in ignorance of 
                                              a statute is an erroneous decision 
                                              in fact and one that would not 
                                              bind the house. By plain 
                                              unreasonable, I am inclined to 
                                              think that over the years this has 
                                              been accepted to apply to cases 
                                              which to most persons, especially

                                              studied and mastered the substance 
                                              of the law, are obviously 
                                              erroneous as running counter to 
                                              fundamental principles which lie 
                                              at the root of the judicial

                                              sense of injustice is a grievous 
                                              thing.” The pre-1960 application 
                                              of judicial precedent did reflect 
                                              the English position and the 
                                              post-1960 position made no 
                                              difference. However, article 104 
                                              (2) of the Constitution, 1969 
                                              which is now contained in both the 
                                              Constitution, 1969107 and the 
                                              Constitution, 1992108&nbsp; introduced, 
                                              as already pointed out, a new 
                                              stare decisis rule, specific and 
                                              unequivocal. The effect of the new 
                                              rule is that the Supreme Court 
                                              &quot;may depart from a previous 
                                              decision where it appears right so 
                                              to do.&quot; The use of the word right, 
                                              an antonym of wrong, introduced a 
                                              moral yardstick into the whole 
                                              equation. The new rule throws us 
                                              back to the old debate under new

                                              already accepted this new stare

                                              The majority decision in 
                                              Liversidge v Anderson ran counter 
                                              to a stream of cases which have 
                                              for years been accepted as 
                                              precedents for a fundamental 
                                              principle of the English common 
                                              law. That principle is that any 
                                              person imprisoning or causing the 
                                              imprisonment of a citizen has the 
                                              onus of justifying his action in a 
                                              court of law. The Rossminster case 
                                              in overruling Liversidge v 
                                              Anderson, repaired the deep crack 
                                              which the Halliday and Liversidge 
                                              types of cases had caused by 
                                              breaching this fundamental 
                                              principle. The principle was

                                              study of how the superior courts 
                                              in Ghana have carried out their 
                                              functions under the two stare 
                                              decisis regimes mandated by the 
                                              Constitution, 1960 and the 
                                              Constitution, 1969 having regard 
                                              to the common law principle 
                                              contained in this English

                                              decide was Re Akoto.120 That case 
                                              postulated a Liversidge v Anderson 
                                              situation in a habeas corpus 
                                              application where the High Court 
                                              had refused the application. On 
                                              appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed 
                                              the refusal. The Supreme Court had 
                                              access to the impeccable reasoning 
                                              of Lord Radcliffe in the Nakkuda 
                                              Ali case renouncing the Liversidge 
                                              ratio and although with us the 
                                              Privy Council decisions are 
                                              hierarchically more authoritative 
                                              than those of the House of Lords, 
                                              the Supreme Court nevertheless 
                                              apparently rejected the Nakkuda 
                                              Ali case and followed the 
                                              Liversidge ratio. The Supreme 
                                              Court did this in spite of the 
                                              fact that the fundamental

                                              all the law must adapt itself to

                                              of the transitional provisions of 
                                              the Constitution, 1979. The

                                              It would appear from the wording 
                                              that what is proscribed in this 
                                              ouster clause is &quot;executive, 
                                              legislative or judicial action, 
                                              taken or purported to have been 
                                              taken.&quot; The action must prima 
                                              facie be either executive, or 
                                              legislative or judicial, before 
                                              the question whether it was taken 
                                              or purported to have been taken 
                                              arises. On this analysis a 
                                              criminal or unlawful act is 
                                              outside the purview of this ouster 
                                              clause. And when faced with the 
                                              provision, almost all the judges 
                                              in the lower superior courts had 
                                              no difficulty in holding in case 
                                              after case that unlawful and 
                                              criminal acts are completely 
                                              outside the purview of the 
                                              transitional provisions. There are 
                                              some instances136: In Darkwa v The 
                                              Republic, Charles Crabbe JSC,

                                              and Edusei JA held in effect that 
                                              the transitional provisions did 
                                              not cover and protect illegal 
                                              acts. In Armah v Ghana Water and

                                              conclusion. That conclusion was 
                                              also followed by Sarkodee J in

                                              to a similar conclusion in

                                              case, virtually on all fours with 
                                              the Kwakye case, it was alleged 
                                              that the applicant was tried by 
                                              the AFRC. But the only document

                                              detention of the applicant in the

                                              the court was a photostat copy of

                                              undecipherable signature of an 
                                              unidentifiable person. The 
                                              applicant claimed he had never 
                                              been tried. Cecilia

                                              The manner in which the Supreme

                                              provisions is reminiscent of the 
                                              vacillation of the early English 
                                              courts. In the Kwakye case on 22 
                                              March 1981 it had held quite 
                                              unambiguously that the provisions 
                                              did not oust its jurisdiction.138 
                                              Barely nine months later, it held,

                                              provisions oust its jurisdiction; 
                                              such a volte face is normally

                                              acquiesced in a proposition of

                                              Furthermore, the Supreme Court in 
                                              the Kwakye case acquiesced in a 
                                              proposition, clearly fallacious, 
                                              that a group of persons under oath 
                                              of secrecy to remain anonymous can 
                                              conduct a secret trial, without 
                                              indicating the authority under 
                                              which they act, and by virtue of 
                                              such secret trial they can 
                                              lawfully convict a Ghanaian 
                                              citizen. On such conviction the 
                                              superior court further agreed that 
                                              such a Ghanaian citizen can 
                                              lawfully be imprisoned and 
                                              presumably executed if so 
                                              sentenced. This surely undermines 
                                              a fundamental and paramount 
                                              principle which is the very 
                                              foundation of our criminal justice 
                                              system. Such a precedent 
                                              reminiscent of the Liversidge case 
                                              is aberrant and like that case can 
                                              hardly survive the ravages of 
                                              time. Such an interpretation of 
                                              the transitional provisions would 
                                              seem to be frowned upon by the 
                                              Ghanaian public including those 
                                              who have no pretensions to 
                                              knowledge of our law. Glance 
                                              through Ghanaian newspapers from 
                                              28 April 1992 to the date of this

                                              where the Chairman of the PNDC, 
                                              Flt-Lt J J Rawlings gave as his 
                                              opinion that the transitional 
                                              provisions do not protect criminal 
                                              and unlawful acts.141 If you had 
                                              listened to the lecture by the

                                              Honourable Martin Amidu,142 you 
                                              could realise that like the 
                                              Chairman of the PNDC, he was also 
                                              of the view that the transitional 
                                              provisions do not protect criminal 
                                              and illegal acts.</span></p>

                                              There is a respectable school of 
                                              thought in the country that 
                                              decisions of the final appellate 
                                              court should be always respected 
                                              and followed by the lower superior 
                                              courts and that those courts 
                                              should not criticise the final 
                                              appellate court.143 The number of 
                                              cases in which lower courts have 
                                              criticised higher courts are very

                                              criticism has been good for the 
                                              law, it has enabled the court to 
                                              take a second look at earlier 
                                              decisions and rationally consider 
                                              whether in the light of the 
                                              criticism, it can in the interest

                                              have the extraordinary situation 
                                              in which the view of the law taken 
                                              by the Supreme Court judges and 
                                              one Court of Appeal judge is set 
                                              aside by three Court of Appeal 
                                              judges. This is clearly 
                                              unsatisfactory. Hopefully with the

                                              vested in the Supreme Court. This

                                              final judicial power in the State 
                                              given to one Supreme Court, it

                                              Brenan, stated the position with 
                                              regard to courts like our Supreme 
                                              Court when he described the 
                                              decision making process in the US 
                                              Supreme Court saying that their

                                              one panel may conflict with the 
                                              decision of another. A more

                                              exclusively vested in the 
                                              judiciary with the Supreme Court 
                                              in complete control of this power. 
                                              The judicial power of the State so 
                                              vested is total and can be 
                                              regulated but it cannot be 
                                              restricted by rules of court which 
                                              are merely the products of the 
                                              exercise of powers by bodies 
                                              inferior to the legislature and 
                                              the Constitution. Even the 
                                              legislature under the Constitution 
                                              cannot restrict the exercise of 
                                              judicial power by the Supreme 
                                              Court. Indeed under article 117 
                                              (2) of the Constitution, 1979 
                                              (repeated in article 131 (2) of 
                                              the Constitution, 1992), the 
                                              Supreme Court has constitutional 
                                              power to entertain an application 
                                              for special leave to appeal and 
                                              grant leave accordingly. Moreover 
                                              the Supreme Court itself in 
                                              exercise of its inherent 
                                              jurisdiction as a court of record

                                              Republic v Appiah161 clearly 
                                              misconceived the meaning of

                                              The majority decision also of the 
                                              Supreme Court in Ababio v Mensah 
                                              is cleared a nullity as it is a

                                              ignored the relevant and decisive 
                                              provisions of the Chieftaincy Act, 
                                              1971 (Act 370). The majority 
                                              decision in Kwakye is another 
                                              case. It sanctioned secret trial

                                              subversive of the criminal law 
                                              regime in Ghana. And it put

                                              convicted of a criminal offence

                                              of the people. It is to make 
                                              periodic reports through the Law 
                                              Reform Commission to the President 
                                              and the legislature. The Law 
                                              Reform Commission is to make its 
                                              own recommendations on the report 
                                              thus submitted to Parliament as to 
                                              how the situation can be 
                                              constitutionally rectified. I am 
                                              not advocating a super Supreme 
                                              Court to review Supreme Court 
                                              decisions. I am rather thinking of 
                                              a committee that will seek to 
                                              eliminate injustice in the society 
                                              where it is abundantly clear that 
                                              a Supreme Court decision has 
                                              without doubt created injustice. 
                                              For instance, in the case of an 
                                              injustice in a criminal case 
                                              resulting in imprisonment or a 
                                              death sentence, a recommendation 
                                              from the committee may enable the 
                                              President to exercise his powers 
                                              of mercy by pardoning the victim 
                                              without interfering with the 
                                              Supreme Court decision. In civil 
                                              cases, the legislature may work 
                                              out and forge by the legislative 
                                              process, a strategy by which 
                                              victims of injustice certified by 
                                              the committee can be compensated 
                                              from state funds, a strategy that 
                                              can in appropriate cases be 
                                              extended to victims of the 
                                              criminal justice system.</span></p>
