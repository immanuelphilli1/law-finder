                                              The purpose of this paper is to 
                                              attempt to trace the growth of our 
                                              customary law and its survival in 
                                              spite of the many challenges it 
                                              has encountered over the years. 
                                              Since the success story of its 
                                              survival cannot be told without 
                                              noting the contribution of the 
                                              system of law reporting, it would 
                                              be churlish not to pay tribute to 
                                              the efforts of the Council for Law 
                                              Reporting since its establishment

                                              publication of the decisions of 
                                              the judges in the Ghana Law

                                              It can hardly be disputed that if 
                                              our written sources of customary 
                                              law had been limited to the 
                                              documentary records standing in 
                                              the name of early European writers 
                                              who only had brief encounters with 
                                              the people of the then Gold Coast, 
                                              customary law would have been 
                                              dismissed by lawyers as primitive 
                                              because some aspects of the law 
                                              were presented by the foreign 
                                              writers in a manner which tended 
                                              to make them appear ridiculous. 
                                              One example is the statement which 
                                              equated the payment of dowry with 
                                              the purchase price of the bride.2&nbsp; 
                                              Tribute must therefore be paid to 
                                              the pioneering effort of the 
                                              venerated John Mensah Sarbah who 
                                              saw the need to record the 
                                              decisions of the courts and 
                                              published the first law reports in 
                                              Part II of his book Fanti 
                                              Customary Laws under the title &quot;Fanti

                                              Emizang, Esq of Elmina, Sarbah

                                              expressed his thanks to Sir Joseph 
                                              Turner Hutchinson, then Chief 
                                              Justice of the Gold Coast, &quot;who 
                                              readily gave permission when I 
                                              applied to him to take notes from 
                                              the records of the Court at Cape 
                                              Coast Castle.&quot; In the course of 
                                              his selection of cases, Sarbah 
                                              recounts how he &quot;suddenly received 
                                              an intimation from the Registrar 
                                              that the Chief Justice had 
                                              withdrawn his permission.&quot; 
                                              Consequently he appealed to his 
                                              readers to pardon him for any 
                                              errors which might be detected in 
                                              the reported cases.</span></p>

                                              There was a monkey who wanted to 
                                              get some nuts that were hot and 
                                              afire; he got a cat, and used her 
                                              hands to pull the nuts out of the 
                                              fire. The monkey got the nuts, and 
                                              the cat burnt her fingers. Anthony

                                              The origin of our customary law 
                                              must be as old as the history of 
                                              the ancient states of our 
                                              fatherland which were founded as a 
                                              result of ethnic migration, trade 
                                              and ethnic warfare. By this 
                                              process our country was peopled by 
                                              inhabitants who settled here from 
                                              various parts of the African 
                                              continent. Historians suggest that 
                                              the Mole-Dagbane states of 
                                              Mamprusi, Dagomba, Gonja and the 
                                              Mossi states of Yatenga and 
                                              Wagadugu were among the earliest 
                                              of the kingdoms to emerge in 
                                              Northern Ghana. The area below 
                                              Northern Ghana or the middle belt 
                                              of Ghana saw the founding of such 
                                              ethnic groups as the Banda, Adansi, 
                                              Denkyira, Fante, Akyem and Asante 
                                              collectively described as the Akan 
                                              people who moved south rather than 
                                              accept the religion of Islam5&nbsp; It 
                                              is estimated that nearly 50 per 
                                              cent of the population of Ghana 
                                              are members of this group. Oral 
                                              traditions affirm that as the 
                                              Akans continued their migration 
                                              down south they came into contact 
                                              with peoples living in the coastal 
                                              districts who were linguistically 
                                              and culturally different from 
                                              them. The western coast consisted 
                                              of the Guan and the eastern coast 
                                              comprised the Ga, the Adangbe, the 
                                              Shai, Krobo and the Ewe. In the 
                                              light of the diverse ways by which 
                                              our country was built, it is not 
                                              surprising that the process of 
                                              settlement spawned traces of 
                                              customary law whose sources were 
                                              as diverse as the different people 
                                              who founded the country. Some 30 
                                              years ago, Lord Denning found a 
                                              fitting description of the variety 
                                              of laws which prevailed on the 
                                              continent of Africa with these 
                                              words:</span></p>

                                              pieces much like a jig-saw. One 
                                              group of pieces is founded on the 
                                              customs of the African peoples, 
                                              which vary from territory to 
                                              territory and from tribe to tribe. 
                                              Another group of pieces is founded 
                                              on the law of Islam, with all its 
                                              many schools and sects. Yet 
                                              another group is founded on the 
                                              English common law. Another on the 
                                              Roman-Dutch law. Another on Indian 
                                              Statutes. And so forth.&quot;</span></p>

                                              There can be no doubt that British 
                                              colonialism posed the first 
                                              challenge to the existence of our 
                                              customary laws. Colonial rule in 
                                              this country began in earnest in 
                                              1821 when the corporation of the 
                                              Company of Merchants trading in 
                                              Africa was dissolved and all its 
                                              possessions including the forts 
                                              and castles on the then Gold Coast 
                                              were vested in His Majesty, his 
                                              heirs and successors forever.7</span></p>

                                              The judicial system at the time of 
                                              the assumption of British rule was 
                                              far from satisfactory. The only 
                                              civil authority was vested in 
                                              individuals who acted as justices 
                                              of the peace and commissioner of 
                                              requests and adjudicated over 
                                              small claims. After 1821 when the 
                                              Gold Coast was administered as a 
                                              dependency of Sierra Leone, the 
                                              administration of justice became 
                                              more cumbersome as serious 
                                              criminal suspects had to be 
                                              transported there for trial. This 
                                              arrangement was resented by both 
                                              the citizens and the 
                                              administrators. The individual 
                                              justices were therefore compelled 
                                              by sheer force of circumstances to 
                                              exercise irregular jurisdiction 
                                              extending beyond their legal 
                                              limits.8 Eventually the Gold 
                                              Coast's dependency upon Sierra 
                                              Leone was terminated and she was 
                                              raised as a separate and distinct 
                                              colony under the British 
                                              Settlements Act, 1843.9 The law 
                                              had had a two-fold purpose. First, 
                                              it enabled the British Crown to 
                                              make laws and establish courts for 
                                              the preservation of order and the 
                                              administration of justice. 
                                              Secondly, it made it lawful for

                                              &quot;Bond&quot; whereby they acknowledged 
                                              the power and jurisdiction of the 
                                              British Queen. They also renounced

                                              barbarous practices. Finally, they

                                              other crimes should be tried by

                                              Some historians interpret the Bond 
                                              as a unilateral declaration by 
                                              which certain Gold Coast rulers 
                                              voluntarily acknowledged British 
                                              law and jurisdiction by renouncing 
                                              part of their sovereignty. This 
                                              view of the matter can only be 
                                              accepted for what it is worth; for 
                                              the juristic basis of the right of

                                              dependency stemmed not from the

                                              With the right of British rule 
                                              firmly established, the Gold Coast 
                                              was on 24 July 1874 proclaimed a 
                                              British Colony and given its own 
                                              colonial executive and legislative 
                                              council body and a Supreme Court. 
                                              The new Court Ordinance passed by 
                                              the colonial legislature provided 
                                              not only for the application by 
                                              the Supreme Court of English 
                                              common law, the doctrines of 
                                              equity and so much of the statutes 
                                              of general application which were 
                                              in force in England on 24 July 
                                              1874, but also it made elaborate 
                                              provisions as to the terms and 
                                              conditions under which &quot;native law

                                              enforced by the court.13</span></p>

                                              various conditions by which

                                              &nbsp;&quot; . . . they are speaking of a 
                                              custom, if custom it can be 
                                              called, which not only does not 
                                              date from 'a time to which the 
                                              memory of man runneth not to the 
                                              contrary,' but actually dates from 
                                              a time which is in the memory of 
                                              men now living. How can this be 
                                              called a custom? I know we are to 
                                              give effect to native law and 
                                              custom as it existed at the date 
                                              of the passing of the Supreme 
                                              Court Ordinance, viz. 1876. But 
                                              the man who drafted that Ordinance 
                                              was a lawyer, and I have no reason 
                                              to suppose that when he spoke of 
                                              'customs' he meant anything more 
                                              or less than the word imparts to 
                                              legal ears.&quot;</span></p>

                                              and that is, that the Courts 
                                              should do all that is in their 
                                              power to fix these fugitive

                                              In other words, although the court 
                                              was to give effect to native 
                                              customs it was only to do so when 
                                              the customs existed at the date of 
                                              the passing of the Supreme Court 
                                              Ordinance, and were customs which 
                                              dated from a &quot;time whereof the

                                              immemorial customs according to

                                              The second condition is this, even 
                                              when the court had been satisfied 
                                              of the existence of a particular

                                              opinion it was &quot;repugnant to

                                              applied in any particular case.16&nbsp; 
                                              Indeed the question by what 
                                              criterion customary law was to be 
                                              recognised, yielded different 
                                              answers to different individual 
                                              judges or colonial administrators. 
                                              Some officials were emphatic that 
                                              in order that it might be 
                                              recognised, it had to conform with 
                                              English colonial notions of 
                                              justice and not African 
                                              conceptions of these; for an 
                                              Englishman because he is an 
                                              Englishman and not someone quite 
                                              different, cannot adopt some other 
                                              person's conception of justice.17 
                                              Statements such as this, coming 
                                              from the lips of a top colonial 
                                              legal officer helped to lower the 
                                              standing of customary law in the 
                                              eyes of the colonial powers; but 
                                              the value of customary law was not 
                                              lost on all colonial officials. As 
                                              far back as 1887, Chief Justice 
                                              Macleod expressed his faith in 
                                              customary law with these words: &quot;I

                                              good and intelligible reasons,

                                              The rule that customary law was to 
                                              be treated as foreign law on its 
                                              own soil must have been drafted 
                                              for the benefit of the expatriate 
                                              colonial judges who were deemed to 
                                              be ignorant of the rules of 
                                              customary law, hence the 
                                              insistence on frequent proof of 
                                              customary law so that the court 
                                              might take judicial notice of 
                                              them. Although the rule was 
                                              subjected to criticism on national 
                                              grounds, there is no doubt that 
                                              the doctrine of judicial ignorance 
                                              of customary law contributed much 
                                              to the process which led to the 
                                              recording of customary law in the 
                                              pages of the law reports. 
                                              Therefore when the time came for 
                                              the Courts Ordinance to be 
                                              replaced by the Courts Act, 
                                              1960,27 it was easy for the 
                                              legislature to provide that &quot;Any 
                                              question as to the existence or

                                              is a question of law for the Court 
                                              and not a question of fact.&quot;&nbsp; 
                                              Under the new law, the court was

                                              In spite of these stringent 
                                              conditions, customary law has 
                                              survived. The main reason for its 
                                              survival is that it was handed 
                                              down to us by our forefathers not 
                                              in the form of a Code, but in the 
                                              form of living law. Its growth was 
                                              therefore evolutionary rather than 
                                              revolutionary. Even though it has 
                                              been exposed to social, economic, 
                                              political and external influences, 
                                              its essential features remain with 
                                              us. It can safely be described as 
                                              the embodiment of our tradition. 
                                              It may be difficult to give it a 
                                              precise legal definition. The 
                                              various Constitutions we have had 
                                              have described customary law to 
                                              mean the rules of law which by 
                                              custom are applicable to 
                                              particular communities. This is 
                                              not an adequate definition.28 
                                              Nevertheless its features are 
                                              easily identifiable. </span></p>

                                              customary law is that it is not 
                                              static and therefore has been able

                                              largely unwritten, and hence it 
                                              was able to adapt itself to all

                                              The fourth characteristic of 
                                              customary law is found in the 
                                              communal nature of its 
                                              application. Maintenance of the

                                              related by kinship has been its 
                                              main objective. A logical 
                                              consequence of the recognition of 
                                              the kinship basis of the society 
                                              gave rise to the development of 
                                              customary law on communal lines. 
                                              Marriage, for example, was seen

                                              native ideas. Land belongs to the

                                              be sustained and enlarged not 
                                              necessarily by birth, but rather 
                                              by the absorption of strangers 
                                              within its circles.39&nbsp; That 
                                              conception give way to the 
                                              formation of a family group which 
                                              was founded on consanguinity or 
                                              kinship. The movement of the 
                                              &quot;progressive societies&quot; gradually 
                                              led to the dissolution of family 
                                              dependency, and the growth of 
                                              individual obligation in its 
                                              place.40&nbsp; The disparate evolution 
                                              of the family is confirmed by 
                                              other studies: Engels wrote

                                              In English law, the law relating 
                                              to the family is said to be of 
                                              recent origin. Lord Scarman wrote

                                              family life was not the law's 
                                              concern, but the business of the 
                                              church.42 Wickens VC described it 
                                              as &quot;a popular and not a technical

                                              had its critics as well as its 
                                              favourites. Samuel Butler, the 
                                              19th century novelist, was of the 
                                              view that the family is a survival 
                                              of the principle which is more 
                                              logically embodied in the compound 
                                              animal. He argued that the family 
                                              was a primitive or positively

                                              family has persisted as a popular

                                              family's role and individual 
                                              responsibility. He identified the

                                              institutions on which all others

                                              another on the basis that they are 
                                              either lineally descended from a 
                                              common ancestress in the female 
                                              line such as the Akan, or a common 
                                              ancestor in the male line such as 
                                              the Ewe. That relationship arises 
                                              generally by birth and in 
                                              exceptional cases by adoption but 
                                              not because of marriage. The Akan 
                                              have a word for the term &quot;family.&quot; 
                                              It is ebusua which is a

                                              group. In that family, the wife 
                                              and children of a married man were 
                                              supposed to belong not to his 
                                              family but to the wife's mother's 
                                              family. Among the patrilineal Ewe, 
                                              a word used to describe the family 
                                              is dzotinu,50 which is meant to 
                                              denote a lineal blood relationship 
                                              through a common male ancestor 
                                              whereby children were said to 
                                              belong to his family and a wife 
                                              considered to be a member of her 
                                              father's family. That word is 
                                              literally translated as a burning 
                                              piece of firewood to signify its 
                                              expensive characteristic.</span></p>

                                              two Akan proverbs. The first is

                                              Admittedly, there is much to be 
                                              said for the custom of allowing a 
                                              head of family to discharge his 
                                              numerous duties without undue 
                                              interference from meddlesome and 
                                              disgruntled members of the family 
                                              because suits in a court of law 
                                              are bound to have a deleterious 
                                              effect on the smooth running of 
                                              the family's affairs. Having said 
                                              that, it has to be recognised that 
                                              the conferment of immunity from

                                              misappropriation of family funds 
                                              could, if not put under scrutiny, 
                                              have led to an abuse of the very

                                              Commission, the government in 1985 
                                              enacted a law called The Head of 
                                              Family (Accountability) Law, 
                                              1985.54&nbsp; It is a very short piece 
                                              of legislation consisting of only 
                                              three sections. Section 1 provides 
                                              that: &quot;any head of family or any 
                                              person who is in possession or

                                              any family property shall be 
                                              accountable for such property to 
                                              the family to which the property 
                                              belongs.&quot; To that end, a duty is 
                                              also imposed on a family head to 
                                              cause and file an inventory of all 
                                              such family property. The second 
                                              section provides a remedy to the 
                                              members who might feel aggrieved. 
                                              But before any such suits may be 
                                              entertained by the court, the 
                                              challenging member is required to 
                                              satisfy it (a) that he has a locus 
                                              standi or a beneficial interest in 
                                              the matter, and (b) that he has 
                                              taken steps to settle the matter 
                                              within the family and that all 
                                              such attempts have failed. The 
                                              third section empowers the courts 
                                              to make an order to compel the 
                                              head of a family to render an 
                                              account in respect of family 
                                              properties in his control or

                                              These reforms are welcome. In 
                                              Ghana there is a gradual movement 
                                              towards this objective that the 
                                              modern family exists for its 
                                              members and not the other way

                                              has improved the public perception

                                              The institution of marriage has 
                                              met with a number of challenges 
                                              both external and internal as a 
                                              result of socio-economic 
                                              pressures. In spite of these 
                                              factors, the family continues to 
                                              play a useful role in marriage.55 
                                              Whereas in most European 
                                              countries, marriage is considered 
                                              to be the basis of the family in 
                                              accordance with the Christian 
                                              decree that &quot;a man shall leave his 
                                              father and mother and unite with 
                                              his wife, and the two will become 
                                              one,&quot;55a in Ghana it would be more 
                                              accurate to describe marriage as 
                                              an institution which has its roots 
                                              in the family rather than the 
                                              family being rooted in 
                                              marriage.56&nbsp; In the Akan system as 
                                              explained by Fortes.57 &quot;there is a

                                              Indeed, one leading editorial in a 
                                              local newspaper in 1885 expressed 
                                              the view that the Ordinance was &quot;a 
                                              mere pretentious measure&quot; adding

                                              legislation.59&nbsp; It cannot be 
                                              seriously denied that the main aim 
                                              of the Ordinance was to confer on 
                                              the parties married under it 
                                              certain material benefits which 
                                              were denied to them under 
                                              customary law. One reason was that 
                                              the customary law conception of 
                                              marriage did not regard wives as 
                                              forming part of the husband's 
                                              economic unit so as to entitle 
                                              them to a separate beneficial 
                                              interest in the assets of the 
                                              marriage. As Sarbah wrote: 
                                              &quot;Whatever a wife helps her husband 
                                              to acquire is the sole property of 
                                              the husband.&quot;60&nbsp; This view of the 
                                              law was given a judicial 
                                              indorsement by Ollennu J (as he 
                                              then was) who said this in Quartey 
                                              v Martey&quot;61 &quot;The proceeds of this

                                              and/or children, and any property 
                                              which the man acquires with such 
                                              proceeds, are by customary law the 
                                              individual property of the man.&quot; 
                                              The fact that customary law was 
                                              clearly lagging behind social 
                                              realities in this context was 
                                              brought out in a series of court 
                                              cases.61a But gradually the 
                                              different legal incidents that 
                                              flowed from a marriage under 
                                              customary law on the one hand and 
                                              a marriage under the Ordinance on 
                                              the other, were marginalised 
                                              partly by judicial decisions and 
                                              partly by legislation.</span></p>

                                              the compulsory registration of 
                                              customary marriages and divorce 
                                              before a state official. The 
                                              application for registration may 
                                              be made at any time after the 
                                              marriage has been contracted. The 
                                              essential requirements for the 
                                              validity of the marriage in 
                                              accordance with the particular 
                                              customary law are, however, left 
                                              to be resolved by the parties and 
                                              their families. The omission to 
                                              spell out the essential 
                                              requirements of customary marriage 
                                              does not detract from the value of 
                                              that legislation, for over the 
                                              years, the courts have, in a 
                                              number of cases, laid down the 
                                              minimum requirements comprised in 
                                              all such marriage contracts. Thus, 
                                              in the case of Yaotey v Quaye65

                                              preserved. It can safely be 
                                              concluded that customary law 
                                              marriages have survived in spite 
                                              of the introduction of statutory

                                              Thus in theory, among the

                                              children were excluded, whilst in 
                                              the case of an Ewe male the 
                                              children enjoyed an interest in

                                              inherited the property of a 
                                              deceased intestate subject to some

                                              of inheritance which needed to be 
                                              reformed in order to ensure its 
                                              survival in our legal system was, 
                                              firstly, the rule that gave a 
                                              lion's share of the estate of a 
                                              deceased individual to his family, 
                                              and secondly, the Akan rule that 
                                              excluded the widow and children 
                                              from enjoying an indefeasible

                                              The first attempt at reform was 
                                              made by statute and was inserted 
                                              into the Marriage Ordinance, 1884 
                                              which provided that where any 
                                              person who is subject to native 
                                              law or custom contracted a 
                                              monogamous marriage under the 
                                              Ordinance and died intestate, 
                                              two-thirds of his property was to 
                                              devolve on his widow and children 
                                              and the remaining one-third was to 
                                              be given to his family (by blood). 
                                              Given the fact that only a small 
                                              number of Ghanaians were prepared 
                                              to contract their marriage under 
                                              the Ordinance, this reforming 
                                              measure benefited only a small 
                                              section of the society.</span></p>

                                              This limited statutory measure was 
                                              followed by a series of campaigns 
                                              mounted by religious and youth 
                                              leaders and chiefs for the reform 
                                              of the law on inheritance. 
                                              However, it had a limited effect 
                                              on the populace.73&nbsp; For example, 
                                              some churches passed their own 
                                              bye-laws on inheritance; but they 
                                              were observed by their members 
                                              only. Besides, the bye-laws did 
                                              not have the force of law. In the 
                                              absence of legislative initiative, 
                                              the challenge for reform fell on 
                                              the shoulders of the judiciary. In 
                                              In re Kofi Antubam (Decd); Quaico

                                              focus public attention once more 
                                              on the anomalies in the regime of 
                                              our inheritance laws.</span></p>

                                              father's family is contrary to all 
                                              biological principles, alien to 
                                              well-known doctrines of all

                                              customary rule is that because 
                                              children are not considered 
                                              members of the father's family,

                                              this exclusion does not make sense 
                                              then the exclusion itself cannot

                                              faces challenges, the more it 
                                              demonstrates its enduring 
                                              features. Indeed, we can say with

                                              the process of democratisation of 
                                              our family system will ensure its
