                                              deemed struck out under rule 
                                              13(2)? That is the question which

                                              The plaintiffs in this case 
                                              successfully sued in the High 
                                              Court, Accra for a declaration 
                                              that a judgment obtained by the 
                                              defendants in the High Court, Ho 
                                              was a nullity and therefore a 
                                              subsequent judgment of the Court 
                                              of Appeal founded on it was 
                                              equally null and void.&nbsp; An appeal 
                                              by the defendants from the High 
                                              Court decision was dismissed by 
                                              the Court of Appeal.&nbsp; The 
                                              defendants again appealed to the 
                                              Supreme Court from that decision 
                                              and fulfilled all the conditions 
                                              of appeal.&nbsp; Subsequently they were 
                                              informed by the Registrar of the 
                                              Supreme Court that the record of 
                                              appeal was ready.&nbsp; However they 
                                              failed to file the statement of 
                                              their case within three weeks of 
                                              being notified that the record of 
                                              appeal was ready as mandatorily 
                                              required by rule 13(1).&nbsp; 
                                              Consequently, the registrar 
                                              informed the parties that the 
                                              appeal had been struck out in 
                                              accordance with rule 13(2).&nbsp; The 
                                              defendants therefore brought an 
                                              application under rule 66(1) for 
                                              an order, inter alia, to “relist

                                              sought an order that their

                                              should be waived under rule 66(1) 
                                              and the appeal be heard on the 
                                              merits.</span></p>

                                              Two issues arose for determination 
                                              by the Supreme Court.&nbsp; First, 
                                              whether the defendant-applicants 
                                              had given good cause for not 
                                              complying with the rule 13(1)?&nbsp; In 
                                              other words, whether the 
                                              non-compliance was not wilful and 
                                              that in the interests of justice 
                                              it should be waived. Secondly, 
                                              whether as contended (on a 
                                              preliminary objection by the 
                                              plaintiffs) the Supreme Court had 
                                              no jurisdiction under rule 66(1) 
                                              to extend the time for filing the 
                                              statement of claim and thus 
                                              restore an appeal struck out under 
                                              rule 13(1).&nbsp; In support of the 
                                              second issue, it was argued by the 
                                              plaintiff-respondents that the 
                                              words “a party to an action” in 
                                              rule 66 meant that the rule was 
                                              applicable only to matters brought 
                                              before the court in the exercise 
                                              of its original jurisdiction2, 
                                              that the words “a party to an 
                                              action” in rule 66(1) were 
                                              distinct from “a party to an 
                                              appeal” as used in some other 
                                              parts of CI 13 and therefore 
                                              “appeals” did not fall within the 
                                              definition of “actions” in rule 66 
                                              and therefore were not affected by 
                                              rule 66(1).</span></p>

                                              connoted both original and

                                              It is interesting to observe that 
                                              soon after the majority in Darke 
                                              had handed down its interpretation 
                                              of rule 66 on 8 July 1991, ie on 
                                              the same day, the Supreme Court 
                                              (differently constituted) in In re 
                                              Oppong (Decd)8 was again called

                                              facts as in Darke. Thus in In re 
                                              Oppong (Decd), an application for 
                                              grant of probate was dismissed by 
                                              the High Court, Kumasi. An appeal 
                                              from that decision to the Court of 
                                              Appeal was equally dismissed. The 
                                              applicants were granted special 
                                              leave to appeal to the Supreme

                                              appeal record was ready.&nbsp; However 
                                              like the applicants in Darke they 
                                              failed to file their statement of

                                              required by rule 13(1) of the 
                                              Rules.&nbsp; They were accordingly 
                                              informed by the registrar that the 
                                              appeal had been struck out under

                                              (Decd) needs to be closely

                                              even consider the issue of whether 
                                              or not to depart from the previous 
                                              majority decision in Darke which 
                                              was binding upon it under article 
                                              116(3) of the Constitution, 1979.&nbsp; 
                                              Although his lordship Wuaku JSC in 
                                              his opinion rightly took the view 
                                              that in a subsequent case the 
                                              Supreme Court would be entitled to 
                                              depart from a previous decision 
                                              “when it is very clear that the 
                                              previous view or decision was 
                                              given per incuriam,” no attempt 
                                              whatsoever was made to show that 
                                              the previous decision of the 
                                              Supreme Court in Darke given 
                                              earlier on the same day, was given

                                              understandably excusable because 
                                              it appears the attention of his

                                              the fact that the issue of 
                                              jurisdiction founded on rule 66 
                                              had been affirmatively decided by

                                              important factor which admittedly 
                                              was not brought to the attention 
                                              of their lordships but which 
                                              nevertheless clearly negates the 
                                              interpretation placed on the words 
                                              “a party to an action” by the 
                                              majority in In re Oppong (Decd).&nbsp; 
                                              The interpretative clause in CI 
                                              13, ie rule 70, defines a “party” 
                                              as including “any party to an 
                                              appeal or other proceeding and his 
                                              counsel.”&nbsp; It is therefore clearly 
                                              illogical for the legislature, ie 
                                              the Rules of Court Committee, to 
                                              define the word “party” in rule 66 
                                              as including an appellant, ie &quot;a 
                                              party to an appeal&quot; and for the 
                                              majority in In re Oppong (Decd) to 
                                              hold that the Rules of Court 
                                              Committee did not intend that the 
                                              phrase &quot;a party to an action&quot; 
                                              should include an appellant.</span></p>

                                              since rule 70 of CI 13 defines

                                              when in his dissenting opinion in 
                                              Darke he said: “The Supreme Court

                                              that ‘a party to an action’ is not 
                                              the same as ‘a party to an

                                              JSC in Darke contrasted the words

                                              63(1) with the words “a party to 
                                              an action” in rule 66.&nbsp; The said 
                                              rule 63(1) provides for the 
                                              calling of new evidence by “a

                                              defensible because rule 63(1)

                                              rule 63(2) also provides that the

                                              jurisdiction under rule 66 because 
                                              the court’s discretionary power 
                                              under the rule was to be exercised 
                                              only when the appeal itself could 
                                              be said to be properly pending 
                                              before the court.&nbsp; It was thus 
                                              held that where the appeal had 
                                              been filed out of time - by only 
                                              48 hours - that constituted a 
                                              fundamental defect - affecting the 
                                              very foundation of the appeal.</span></p>

                                              Consequently, there was, 
                                              notionally, no appeal before the 
                                              court for which the court might 
                                              exercise its jurisdiction under 
                                              rule 66.&nbsp; It follows logically 
                                              that if (as in the subsequent 1991 
                                              decisions in Darke and In re 
                                              Oppong (Decd)) the appeal in the 
                                              1985 Darke decision had been filed 
                                              within time, the Supreme Court 
                                              might have exercised its 
                                              discretionary jurisdiction under 
                                              rule 66 to waive non-compliance 
                                              with the rules.&nbsp; This is the 
                                              clearest binding authority yet 
                                              that the words “a party to an

                                              66 includes an appellant, ie “a

                                              We may conclude that in the 
                                              context of the Rules, the 
                                              interpretation placed on rule 66 
                                              by the majority in the 1991 Darke 
                                              decision appears to be the better 
                                              view.&nbsp; Besides, In re Oppong 
                                              (Decd) suffers from the disability 
                                              of being a per incuriam decision 
                                              for failing to consider the 
                                              earlier 1985 and 1991 binding 
                                              decisions in Darke.&nbsp; It is also 
                                              very interesting to note that even 
                                              though the issue of the Supreme 
                                              Court’s jurisdiction under rule 66 
                                              was in Darke affirmed by a 
                                              majority decision in favour of the 
                                              applicants, the application for 
                                              extension was nevertheless by a 
                                              majority decision dismissed on the 
                                              merits. However, in In re Oppong 
                                              (Decd), the issue of the court’s 
                                              jurisdiction under rule 66 was by 
                                              majority decision disaffirmed 
                                              against the applicants but the 
                                              application for extension of time 
                                              was also by a majority decision 
                                              granted.&nbsp; In any case in the 
                                              subsequent 1992 decision in 
                                              Botchway v Appiah,15 the Supreme 
                                              Court unanimously dismissed, on 
                                              the merits, an application for an 
                                              extension of time within which to 
                                              file a statement of case as 
                                              required by rule 13 of CI 13.&nbsp; 
                                              Unlike the earlier conflicting 
                                              decisions in Darke and In re 
                                              Oppong, the court in Botchway v 
                                              Appiah did not specifically refer 
                                              to the issue of whether or not it 
                                              has jurisdiction under rule 66 of 
                                              CI 13 to grant the application.&nbsp; 
                                              The court simply assumed 
                                              jurisdiction.&nbsp; It considered and 
                                              dismissed it on its merits -
