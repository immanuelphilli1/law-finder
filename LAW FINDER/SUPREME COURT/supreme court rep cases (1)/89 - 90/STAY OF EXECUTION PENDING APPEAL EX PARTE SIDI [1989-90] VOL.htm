                                              One of the ways in which a 
                                              judgment-debtor could frustrate a 
                                              judgment-creditor’s hope of 
                                              reaping the fruits of a judgment 
                                              is by using the rules of court and 
                                              procedures established over the 
                                              years to delay payment as long as 
                                              possible.&nbsp; In this regard one of 
                                              the most effective weapons in his 
                                              arsenal would be the use of the 
                                              appeal system within the hierarchy 
                                              of the courts.&nbsp; He would appeal 
                                              against the decision and 
                                              subsequently apply to the court to 
                                              be granted a stay of execution 
                                              pending the determination of the 
                                              appeal.&nbsp; When such an application 
                                              is granted, depending on the terms 
                                              of the grant, payment of the 
                                              substantive award together with 
                                              costs in the cause could remain 
                                              suspended until the determination 
                                              of the appeal.&nbsp; Having regard to 
                                              the acknowledged delays in our 
                                              adversary system of adjudication, 
                                              this weapon could be effective 
                                              indeed where the judgment-debtor 
                                              decides to exhaust the appeal 
                                              system including recourse to the 
                                              review powers of the Supreme Court 
                                              which are nowadays frequently 
                                              restored to.</span></p>

                                              It is in order to avoid such 
                                              injustice that the courts usually 
                                              grant stays of execution pending 
                                              appeals on terms, balancing the 
                                              interest of both parties on two 
                                              firmly established principles, 
                                              among others. These principles 
                                              are: firstly, that a successful 
                                              party ought not to be prevented 
                                              from enjoying the fruits of the 
                                              judgment, and secondly, that an 
                                              appeal, if successful, must not be 
                                              rendered nugatory.&nbsp; However, in a 
                                              recent decision of a strongly 
                                              constituted Supreme Court in 
                                              Republic v Court of Appeal, Accra: 
                                              Ex parte Sidi,1 there were 
                                              statements made accepting the 
                                              contention by a judgement-debtor, 
                                              that the terms imposed on him in a 
                                              grant of stay of execution pending 
                                              appeal being inconvenient and 
                                              difficult for him to fulfil, 
                                              should be viewed as a refusal of 
                                              the application and therefore 
                                              entitling him to repeat it at the 
                                              Court of appeal under the Court of 
                                              Appeal Rules.2 This would seem to 
                                              run counter to the main stream of 
                                              authorities established over the 
                                              years.&nbsp; The statutory enactments 
                                              governing the determination of 
                                              applications for stay of execution 
                                              pending appeals and the case law 
                                              developed thereon as well as the 
                                              literature on the subject are 
                                              well-known to legal 
                                              practitioners.3&nbsp; The purpose of 
                                              our comment is therefore not to 
                                              describe them in detail but to

                                              Until the Court of Appeal decision 
                                              in Ghassoub v Bibiani Wood Company 
                                              Ltd,4 it would seem, no one had 
                                              ever questioned seriously the 
                                              terms on which the judges have 
                                              been granting stay of execution 
                                              pending appeal in the exercise of 
                                              their discretion over the years.&nbsp; 
                                              Provided the judge had exercised 
                                              his discretion judicially by 
                                              balancing the interests of both 
                                              parties, the application was 
                                              accepted to have been granted, the 
                                              nature of the terms imposed 
                                              notwithstanding.&nbsp; A classic 
                                              example is provided by the 
                                              decision of Apaloo J, as he then 
                                              was, in the celebrated case of 
                                              Saunders v Awudu.5 There, the 
                                              plaintiff recovered judgment for 
                                              £6,000 damages against the 
                                              defendant who had applied to the 
                                              court to be granted a stay of 
                                              execution pending the 
                                              determination of the appeal he had 
                                              filed against the decision.&nbsp; The 
                                              ground for the application was 
                                              that the successful 
                                              judgment-creditor had no visible 
                                              means and it might not be possible 
                                              to recover the sum from her if the 
                                              appeal was successful.</span></p>

                                              It should be noted that the

                                              plaintiff did not prevent the 
                                              court from granting the stay on 
                                              condition that payment of the

                                              case of Joseph v Jebeile.7 There, 
                                              the Supreme Court ordered the

                                              judgment debt of £1,450 into court

                                              appeal.&nbsp; The authority of this 
                                              case has never been questioned on 
                                              any ground that the terms were 
                                              “onerous,” “inconvenient” or

                                              fulfil.&nbsp; What the decisions show 
                                              is that the interests of either 
                                              party require that the amount 
                                              adjudged to be payable should be 
                                              adequately secured so that during 
                                              the pendency of the appeal neither 
                                              party could take advantage of the 
                                              other.&nbsp; Payment into court in the 
                                              interim would seem to be the most 
                                              reasonable compromise the courts 
                                              have been resorting to all along.</span></p>

                                              It is clear therefore that the

                                              In the Oppan case, the plaintiff 
                                              obtained judgment against the 
                                              applicant in the total sum of 
                                              ¢130,500.&nbsp; Dissatisfied with the

                                              the Court of Appeal and 
                                              subsequently applied to the High 
                                              Court praying to be granted a stay 
                                              of execution pending the 
                                              determination of the appeal. The 
                                              court ruled that execution would 
                                              be stayed on condition that the 
                                              whole of the judgment debt and

                                              ruling.&nbsp; Apparently encouraged by 
                                              the decision in the Ghassoub case 
                                              upon which he rested his case, the 
                                              defendant repeated the application 
                                              at the Court of Appeal claiming 
                                              that the conditions imposed by the 
                                              High Court were onerous, 
                                              inconvenient and virtually 
                                              amounted to a refusal of his 
                                              application. For these reasons, he 
                                              thought he was entitled to repeat 
                                              the application under rule 28 of 
                                              the Court of Appeal Rules, 1962

                                              It is crystal clear from rule 27 
                                              that where a judgment is declared

                                              consequent award of a sum of money

                                              defendant; the former could take 
                                              steps prescribed by law to execute 
                                              the judgment so as to reap the 
                                              fruits of the judgment, an appeal 
                                              by the defendant 
                                              notwithstanding.11 But where the 
                                              latter is desirous of preventing 
                                              the immediate exercise by the 
                                              former of his acknowledged right 
                                              to execute the judgment, he would 
                                              have to come under rule 28 of LI 
                                              218. As Adade JSC rightly pointed 
                                              out in his judgment, rule 28 as 
                                              amended by LI 618 clearly gave the 
                                              judgment-debtor the right to apply 
                                              to the Court of Appeal for stay if 
                                              a previous application to the High 
                                              Court was refused.&nbsp; Surely, it 
                                              cannot be disputed by any rule of 
                                              logic that the refusal or the 
                                              dismissal of the application by 
                                              the High Court is the condition 
                                              sine qua non for repeating it at 
                                              the Court of Appeal within the 
                                              meaning of the rules. As Adade JSC 
                                              rightly observed in Bisi v Tabiri 
                                              alias Asare,12 Holmes has given us 
                                              the classic phrase “’the life of 
                                              the law has not been logic’. . . 
                                              but I am yet to read that 
                                              illogical reasoning is a virtue at 
                                              law.” It must also be observed 
                                              that as the High Court has

                                              The problem faced by the applicant 
                                              in the Oppan case therefore was to 
                                              prove that his application at the 
                                              High Court was dismissed and 
                                              therefore was entitled to repeat 
                                              it at the Court of Appeal as a 
                                              fresh one in accordance with the 
                                              rules. The applicant sought to 
                                              discharge this obligation by 
                                              claiming merely that as he found 
                                              the conditions imposed by the 
                                              alleged grant to be onerous, 
                                              inconvenient and difficult to 
                                              fulfil, the application was 
                                              virtually dismissed. As he put it, 
                                              “to pay the whole judgment debt 
                                              into court as ordered by the High 
                                              Court would mean [that] I have to 
                                              sell my landed property as I do 
                                              not have the liquid cash for this 
                                              colossal sum, and this will create 
                                              great hardship on me.” But as 
                                              there was in existence a long 
                                              standing formidable array of 
                                              authorities backed by practice 
                                              indicative of the fact that stays 
                                              of execution pending appeals have 
                                              been granted over the years on 
                                              terms, apparently much more 
                                              onerous than that about which the 
                                              applicant was complaining, the 
                                              task confronting him was obviously 
                                              formidable. But he found solace in 
                                              the Ghassoub case.</span></p>

                                              application had been satisfied and 
                                              that the mere fact that a 
                                              defendant-judgment-debtor might 
                                              find payment inconvenient or

                                              the court.&nbsp; The application, he 
                                              pointed out, would have been 
                                              granted on terms; for as long as 
                                              the order subsisted the 
                                              plaintiff-judgment-creditor was

                                              execution. His lordship referred 
                                              to the solid authorities of Joseph

                                              reinforce his argument. He pointed 
                                              out convincingly that the £6,000

                                              one million cedis in 1983 and 
                                              therefore about ten times the

                                              add that the terms imposed in the

                                              and many other cases could be seen 
                                              to be far more stringent than the 
                                              one complained of in the Oppan 
                                              case.&nbsp; Yet no one has ever 
                                              suggested that those orders were 
                                              either invalid or amounted to a 
                                              refusal of the application.</span></p>

                                              the High Court (Civil Procedure) 
                                              Rules, 1954.&nbsp; He found support in 
                                              Fitouri Krekchi v United Africa Co 
                                              Ltd15 in which the West African 
                                              Court of Appeal used the terms, 
                                              “stay of execution” and suspending 
                                              execution interchangeably. But if 
                                              it is agreed that the effect of 
                                              any grant of stay of execution 
                                              whether on terms or not, does

                                              determined, can it be said in 
                                              reality that the grant on terms 
                                              which compel the applicant to pay

                                              Apparently encouraged by the 
                                              decision in the Ghassoub case, the 
                                              defendant repeated the application 
                                              in the Court of Appeal contending 
                                              that the terms were harsh and 
                                              onerous and therefore should be 
                                              construed as a refusal.&nbsp; The Court 
                                              of Appeal followed the reasoning 
                                              in the Oppan case and held that 
                                              the application had not been 
                                              refused but had been granted on 
                                              terms and that if the defendant 
                                              was dissatisfied with those terms, 
                                              his remedy lay in an appeal 
                                              against those terms. Being 
                                              dissatisfied, he brought an 
                                              application before the Supreme 
                                              Court for, inter alia, certiorari 
                                              to quash the decision of the Court 
                                              of Appeal and for mandamus to 
                                              order the Court of Appeal to hear 
                                              the application.</span></p>

                                              Granting the application 
                                              unanimously and severely 
                                              criticising the decision in the 
                                              Oppan case, the Supreme Court held 
                                              that when an applicant in Ghana 
                                              applied for stay of execution of a 
                                              judgment debt, he was asking the 
                                              court to suspend the actual 
                                              payment of the debt pending the 
                                              outcome of the appeal. If he was, 
                                              in effect, asked to pay the whole 
                                              of the judgment debt, whether into 
                                              court or not, he would justifiably 
                                              consider it an abuse of language 
                                              and an indulgence in 
                                              technicalities to argue that he 
                                              had been granted his application 
                                              for stay. Consequently, an alleged 
                                              grant having attached to it 
                                              onerous conditions stultifying the 
                                              substantive expectation of an 
                                              applicant was a refusal. Hence the 
                                              High Court order that the whole of 
                                              the judgment debt of one million 
                                              cedis be paid into court within 
                                              three months was, in the 
                                              circumstances of the case and 
                                              within the context of Ghanaian 
                                              conditions, tantamount to a 
                                              virtual dismissal of the 
                                              application because the average 
                                              Ghanaian could not fulfil them and 
                                              was therefore a “refusal ab initio.”</span></p>

                                              payment of the said debt pending 
                                              the outcome of the appeal.”&nbsp; He

                                              the applicant was unable to obtain 
                                              the colossal sum of ¢1,000,000 to 
                                              be paid into court, then the order

                                              judgment-creditor would be 
                                              entitled to go into execution.&nbsp;

                                              respectful view difficult to

                                              These views were apparently 
                                              expressed as a criticism of the 
                                              reasoning by which the Court of 
                                              Appeal in the Oppan case came to 
                                              the conclusion that the 
                                              application in question was 
                                              granted on terms.&nbsp; With the 
                                              greatest respect, and in humility, 
                                              the Supreme Court would seem to 
                                              have been at cross-purposes with 
                                              the Court of Appeal here.&nbsp; The 
                                              premises of the Court of Appeal in 
                                              the Oppan case was to conceive of 
                                              a “grant of stay” as restricting 
                                              or delaying the exercise of the 
                                              right by the successful 
                                              judgment-creditor to go into 
                                              execution within seven days after 
                                              the award, in accordance with 
                                              Order 42.&nbsp; Surely, whether or not 
                                              the judgment-debtor, on the orders 
                                              of the court on terms, pays the 
                                              whole or part of the amount 
                                              awarded into court, it does not 
                                              thereby free the judgment-creditor 
                                              from the fetters that limit his 
                                              freedom of action to recover 
                                              payment.&nbsp; In this sense then, a 
                                              stay would have been granted 
                                              despite the conditions which might 
                                              compel the former to pay some 
                                              money into court.&nbsp; The Court of 
                                              Appeal’s conclusions in the Oppan 
                                              case thus follow logically and 
                                              validly from that premise; and it 
                                              must be conceded that such 
                                              conclusions were consistent with 
                                              all the authorities that have 
                                              expounded the law on the issue 
                                              ante-dating the Chassoub thesis. 
                                              Of course, it is conceded that the 
                                              corollary of the Oppan premises 
                                              might be true of the Ex parte Sidi 
                                              premises in some cases.&nbsp; This must 
                                              be so because so long as the 
                                              plaintiff is prevented from going 
                                              into execution so would the 
                                              defendant’s obligation to pay be 
                                              suspended. That was the premise of 
                                              the Supreme Court. However, this 
                                              is not a necessary condition for 
                                              maintaining that the two premises 
                                              are one and the same thing.&nbsp; The 
                                              primary reason for this conclusion 
                                              is that the cases do not support 
                                              the premise of the Supreme Court 
                                              in Ex parte Sidi.&nbsp; If they did, 
                                              there would have been no place for 
                                              cases such as Saunders v Awudu; 
                                              Joseph v Jebeile, etc, just to 
                                              mention a few.&nbsp; Applications for 
                                              stay in cases of that nature would 
                                              all have been regarded as having 
                                              been refused.&nbsp; If we are to accept 
                                              the Supreme Court’s premise, which 
                                              conceives of a stay as 
                                              “suspending” payment by the 
                                              judgment-debtor simpliciter, and 
                                              not, as the Court of Appeal 
                                              regarded it in the Oppan case, as 
                                              the restricting or suspending the 
                                              exercise of right by the 
                                              judgment-creditor to go into 
                                              execution, then all the cases in 
                                              which the defendants had been 
                                              ordered to pay the whole or part 
                                              of the judgment debt into court in 
                                              the interim would now be regarded 
                                              as having been overruled and no 
                                              longer good authority.&nbsp; Certainly, 
                                              the Supreme Court could never have 
                                              intended to stretch its logic that 
                                              far.&nbsp; That is why it held that to 
                                              obviate protracted litigation the 
                                              court would order the judgment 
                                              debt and costs to be stayed upon 
                                              more favourable terms pending the 
                                              hearing and the determination of 
                                              the appeal before the Court of 
                                              Appeal.&nbsp; The court thus went ahead 
                                              and granted stay on condition that 
                                              the defendant paid into court 
                                              ¢200,000.&nbsp; It is submitted that as 
                                              the condition imposed involved the 
                                              payment of money before the 
                                              determination of the appeal the 
                                              grant was in conformity with 
                                              previous authorities but was 
                                              inconsistent with the Supreme 
                                              Court’s own premise that conceives 
                                              a grant of stay as a “suspension” 
                                              of payment by the applicant.&nbsp; 
                                              Whatever be the case, we believe 
                                              that the Supreme Court did not, by 
                                              the decision in Ex parte Sidi, 
                                              seek to abolish grants of stay on 
                                              terms that require the 
                                              judgment-debtor to pay the whole 
                                              or part of the judgment debt 
                                              before the determination of the 
                                              appeal.&nbsp; But the Supreme Court 
                                              itself had never made this clear 
                                              in its judgment.</span></p>

                                              that the Supreme Court had 
                                              confused the premise of its 
                                              interpretation of “stay of 
                                              execution” in Ex parte Sidi, with 
                                              those of the Court of Appeal in 
                                              the Oppan case.&nbsp; This mainly 
                                              accounted for the different 
                                              conclusions in both cases. We 
                                              submit further that for reasons to 
                                              be elucidated below, the Oppan 
                                              premise is to be preferred not 
                                              only because it is supported by 
                                              precedent, experience and 
                                              practice, but it provides a 
                                              sounder basis for balancing the 
                                              interest of the parties.</span></p>

                                              Another aspect of the Supreme 
                                              Court decision which deserves 
                                              comment is its disagreement with 
                                              the decision in the Oppan case 
                                              that the mere fact that a 
                                              defendant-judgment-debtor might 
                                              find payment inconvenient or 
                                              onerous could not be construed as 
                                              a refusal of the application by 
                                              the court and that the application 
                                              would have been granted on terms.&nbsp; 
                                              In terms of the Supreme Court’s 
                                              logic that where the applicant is 
                                              required to pay the judgment debt, 
                                              then payment would not have been 
                                              “suspended” and therefore a stay 
                                              would have been refused, the Court 
                                              of Appeal would have been wrong.&nbsp; 
                                              But in the light of precedent and 
                                              experience and the way in which 
                                              the courts have, over the years 
                                              treated the grant of a stay on 
                                              terms as a grant and not a 
                                              refusal, particularly because the 
                                              successful party’s right to go 
                                              into execution would have been 
                                              suspended, the Court of Appeal 
                                              would be right.</span></p>

                                              But the Supreme Court’s decision 
                                              was not only based on the logic of

                                              applicant into court, either in 
                                              whole or in part.&nbsp; It held 
                                              additionally that where the 
                                              alleged grant had attached to it 
                                              onerous conditions that stultified 
                                              the substantive expectation of an 
                                              applicant, that would amount to a 
                                              refusal.&nbsp; In the particular case 
                                              at hand the applicant’s claim that 
                                              the payment of the one million 
                                              cedis plus the ¢5,000 costs within 
                                              three months was onerous and harsh 
                                              and therefore amounting to refusal 
                                              was acceded to by the Supreme 
                                              Court.&nbsp; This would seem to be an 
                                              introduction of a new principle 
                                              into the rules for determining 
                                              applications for stay of execution 
                                              pending appeals. Innocuous as it

                                              Firstly, it must be pointed out 
                                              that the courts do not exist to 
                                              satisfy the expectations of 
                                              applicants.&nbsp; They do exist to do 
                                              justice as between the parties.&nbsp; 
                                              In doing so they apply the law to 
                                              the evidence before them 
                                              regardless of the expectations of 
                                              the parties.&nbsp; Each party’s 
                                              expectation is that the court 
                                              should give a decision favourable 
                                              to him.&nbsp; In this regard their 
                                              expectation would normally be in 
                                              conflict.&nbsp; Hence a decision one

                                              convenient to him; and in the

                                              linked, but over which we have no

                                              It could be noticed from the above 
                                              quotation that the application 
                                              would have been granted not 
                                              (refused) on the condition that 
                                              the judgment debt be paid into 
                                              court.&nbsp; But where the application 
                                              is refused and the 
                                              judgment-creditor becomes entitled 
                                              to go into execution, then he is 
                                              requested to give security to the 
                                              satisfaction of the court, for the

                                              Therefore a grant of stay on 
                                              conditions, no matter how onerous 
                                              cannot be interpreted as a

                                              In the light of the above, and in 
                                              the interest of justice, we agree 
                                              with the suggestion made in the 
                                              judgment of Francois JSC that we 
                                              adopt the English practice of “the 
                                              losing party paying the judgment 
                                              debt on security from the winning 
                                              party of repayment if the appeal 
                                              is successful.&nbsp; Besides, securing 
                                              undertakings by counsel are also 
                                              resorted to.”&nbsp; That suggestion is 
                                              in accord with what our courts 
                                              have been traditionally accustomed 
                                              to doing all along. We should add 
                                              that in such cases, the 
                                              judgment-creditor should be 
                                              compelled and made to understand 
                                              that where the appeal succeeds he 
                                              is liable to refund the money 
                                              received together wit not be 
                                              earlier than the statutory grace 
                                              period of seven days normally 
                                              allowed the judgment-debtor.&nbsp; This 
                                              position is justifiable because as 
                                              soon as a judgment is declared 
                                              against a party and awards are 
                                              made, his liability to pay arises, 
                                              his financial circumstances 
                                              notwithstanding. It is an 
                                              obligation imposed by law. Until 
                                              declared bankrupt according to law 
                                              these obligations cannot be 
                                              changed to suit his personal

                                              From this view point, it follows 
                                              that the controversial question 
                                              which arose concerning the remedy

                                              terms that require payment of the 
                                              amount with security as suggested, 
                                              the obligation to pay would arise 
                                              without a right of appeal against
