                                              a superior court judge for a 
                                              period of 31 years cannot be lost 
                                              on the people of 
                                              Ghana—particularly Honourable 
                                              Members of the legal fraternity in 
                                              Ghana. It is conceded on all sides 
                                              that he was a successful and a 
                                              distinguished judge and an eminent 
                                              jurist. His integrity and honesty 
                                              both in his personal and public 
                                              life were publicly 
                                              acknowledged—and in fact he passed 
                                              the acid test—when he willingly 
                                              and fearlessly presented himself 
                                              before Parliament for vetting and 
                                              approval as Justice of the Supreme 
                                              Court in compliance with article 
                                              127(1) of the 1979 Third 
                                              Republican Constitution. By his 
                                              judicial decisions and 
                                              pronouncements he exhibited the 
                                              sterling traits of being 
                                              forthright, candid, consistent, 
                                              just and uncompromising on 
                                              principles he believes in, 
                                              particularly when they have to do 
                                              with the freedom, liberty and the 
                                              fundamental human rights of the 
                                              individual. His concern for the 
                                              weak, the poor and young 
                                              offenders, his objection to 
                                              piecemeal prosecution of a person 
                                              suspected of crimes as 
                                              constituting oppression by the 
                                              State against the individual, his 
                                              abhorrence of dishonesty, 
                                              injustice and unfairness are most 
                                              welcome traits reflected in his 
                                              numerous incisive and erudite 
                                              judgments, rulings, articles and 
                                              public speeches.</span></p>

                                              He was a judge who had deep 
                                              respect for judicial precedents 
                                              but at the same time his lordship 
                                              did not shy away from rejecting 
                                              judicial precedents - however 
                                              hallowed and exalted—if convinced 
                                              that they were demonstrably wrong: 
                                              see for instance his landmark 
                                              decision in Nkrumah v Manu [1971] 
                                              1 GLR 176, where his lordship, as 
                                              a High Court judge, criticised as 
                                              wrongly decided the Court of 
                                              Appeal decision in Attiase v 
                                              Abobbtey (1969) CC 149. And in 
                                              paying tribute to Justice Taylor, 
                                              the Review cannot fail to draw 
                                              attention to his monumental 
                                              decisions such as Billa v Salifu 
                                              [1971] 2 GLR 87 and his powerful, 
                                              well-reasoned and highly 
                                              illuminating dissenting opinions 
                                              such as that in Kwakye v 
                                              Attorney-General [1981] GLR 944. 
                                              If in Billa his lordship very much 
                                              enriched our knowledge of Dagomba 
                                              customary law, in Kwakye he did 
                                              show deep concern for respect for 
                                              individual human rights. Equally 
                                              in his dissenting opinion in the 
                                              Supreme Court decision in Appiah v 
                                              The Republic [1987-88] GLRD 88 he 
                                              championed the rights of the 
                                              accused against the oppressive 
                                              State apparatus. As his lordship 
                                              put it: &quot;we in the traditional 
                                              courts have been obliged for over 
                                              a century to strain hard to uphold 
                                              a balance that will ensure that 
                                              the accused has justice and the 
                                              State apparatus is not used 
                                              oppressively against him.&quot;</span></p>

                                              ceremony on 30 March 1990. In his

                                              Okudzeto, chairman of the ceremony 
                                              on that occasion pointed out that 
                                              in honouring Mr Justice Taylor, 
                                              the Bar Association was not 
                                              setting a precedent to be followed 
                                              on the retirement of every judge. 
                                              The case of Kobina Taylor was a 
                                              special one in recognition of his 
                                              rare qualities and contribution to 
                                              the development of the law. He 
                                              stressed that it was only judges 
                                              who could measure up to such 
                                              standards that would be honoured 
                                              in a similar manner. The Review

                                              Supreme Court, who retires at the 
                                              mandatory retiring age of 65, 
                                              after almost 21 years on the 
                                              Bench, and having declined to 
                                              accept an ad hoc extension of one 
                                              year to stay on. As in all such 
                                              cases, we do so with mixed 
                                              feelings. We are naturally sad and 
                                              disappointed that so soon the 
                                              judiciary, indeed the people of 
                                              our dear country, Ghana, has to 
                                              miss the agile, fertile, 
                                              prospective and imaginative brain 
                                              of Mr Justice Taylor. Some of us, 
                                              until now, were of the erroneous 
                                              view that Mr Justice Taylor was in 
                                              his late fifties.</span></p>

                                              It may be appropriate and 
                                              opportune at this time to once 
                                              again call on the government of 
                                              the PNDC to take another look at 
                                              its law which enables and gives 
                                              power to the government to extend 
                                              the tenure of office of a judge 
                                              who reaches the compulsory 
                                              retiring age of 65 for such 
                                              periods and from time to time as 
                                              it may deem fit. The Ghana Bar 
                                              Association has already expressed 
                                              its views on this law. The 
                                              Association thinks that this does 
                                              not augur well for, but rather 
                                              undermines, the integrity and 
                                              independence of the judiciary. Is 
                                              it not possible that a judge who 
                                              is desirous and wants badly the 
                                              extension of time may lose his 
                                              independence and independent 
                                              judgment in the belief, even if 
                                              mistaken, that there is a Big 
                                              Brother somewhere who is watching 
                                              every step he takes and 
                                              scrutinises all his legal 
                                              pronouncements and that to retain 
                                              his position he must of necessity 
                                              play ball? Admittedly, such a 
                                              person is not worthy of being a 
                                              judge. But, the inescapable truth 
                                              is that such a possibility exists. 
                                              The Ghana Bar Association thinks 
                                              that the government should be 
                                              called upon to provide and ensure 
                                              uniform and compulsory retiring 
                                              age for all judges and that it 
                                              should put a stop to the selective 
                                              extension of tenure of judges.</span></p>

                                              have already indicated that it is

                                              brighter and happier aspect of the 
                                              ceremony this morning is to 
                                              acknowledge and honour legal 
                                              brilliance, excellence,

                                              hope, will inspire all other 
                                              judges, and those who aspire to 
                                              become one. Shall we say this 
                                              affords the Association the rare 
                                              opportunity to pronounce judgments 
                                              on our judges? It must be said 
                                              that we do not intend it to become 
                                              a wholesale affair and a matter of 
                                              course. We shall not honour a 
                                              judge because of the personal 
                                              views we hold about him and only 
                                              on account of friendship and 
                                              relationship. It needs to be 
                                              emphasised that we do and shall do 
                                              so only on account of legal 
                                              excellence and distinction.

                                              Who then is the man Mr Justice J N 
                                              Kobina Taylor? Shakespeare says

                                              acquire greatness and others 
                                              achieve greatness. To my mind, it 
                                              is the last that is true and apt

                                              Admittedly, Justice Taylor has a 
                                              royal blood in him because of his 
                                              maternal link with the James Town

                                              Mr Justice Taylor was born in 
                                              Accra on 24 March 1925. He began 
                                              his formal schooling in the then 
                                              Accra United School in 1931 where 
                                              he stayed until 1936 and left for 
                                              Nigeria. He was in St Thomas' 
                                              Catholic School, Kano, from 
                                              1937-40 from where he proceeded to 
                                              St Gregory's College, Lagos, in 
                                              1941 up to 1945. He returned to 
                                              Ghana and went to Achimota College 
                                              where between 1946-47 he read for 
                                              Inter BSc (Engineering). The next 
                                              few years saw him in the teaching 
                                              profession. Between 1948-50 he was 
                                              a tutor in Science, Mathematics 
                                              and Latin at Odorgonno Secondary 
                                              School, Accra. In 1950 he became 
                                              and served for two years as 
                                              Headmaster of the now defunct West 
                                              Africa College in Accra.</span></p>

                                              In 1953 he left for the United 
                                              Kingdom where he attended the 
                                              University College, London 1956-57

                                              1954-58. He was called to the 
                                              English Bar (Lincolns Inn) in 
                                              1958. He also experienced life 
                                              between 1953-55 as a Carriage

                                              British Railways. He returned to 
                                              Ghana in 1959 and was employed as 
                                              Assistant Crown Counsel in the 
                                              Attorney-General's Office and 
                                              remained in that office until 1969 
                                              when he was elevated as a justice 
                                              of the High Court. He went through 
                                              the ranks in the 
                                              Attorney-General's Office and 
                                              served in various grades as State, 
                                              Senior and Principal State

                                              Prosecutions. In 1969, he acted as

                                              Commissioner for Justice. In 1980, 
                                              after 11 years as a High Court

                                              The varied experiences that Mr 
                                              Justice Taylor went through helped 
                                              to shape his legal brain, 
                                              conception, attitude and his 
                                              contribution to the development of 
                                              law in our country. No one, even 
                                              with a casual association with our 
                                              judiciary, can deny Mr Justice 
                                              Taylor his due. He is no lazy 
                                              judge and never tolerated counsel 
                                              who were ill-prepared and who 
                                              never studied their brief. He read 
                                              and was conversant with the case 
                                              dockets that were placed before 
                                              him. He believed in clarity of 
                                              reasoning, and sometimes looks 
                                              like an advocate rather than a 
                                              judge. But this no doubt, was to 
                                              enable him understand better the 
                                              issues and cases that he had to 
                                              pronounce upon. To him, there was 
                                              no small case. All were equally 
                                              important and he brought zeal, 
                                              scholarship and hardwork to bear 
                                              on his judgment, be it a simple 
                                              marriage custom in Dagomba or the 
                                              controversial AFRC trials and the 
                                              provisions of the Constitution, 
                                              1979. He is a fearless man who 
                                              never shies away from expressing 
                                              his independent views, quite a 
                                              number of times, in dissenting 
                                              judgments and in very strong 
                                              language. He is not the one to 
                                              compromise on a principle for the 
                                              sake of convenience or advantage. 
                                              He hates the abuse of power, 
                                              totalitarianism and dictatorship 
                                              in any form. His judgments bear 
                                              ample testimony to this. He 
                                              believes in judicial independence 
                                              and fights for it. Such a man as I 
                                              have sought to describe, is bound 
                                              to evoke controversy and turn the 
                                              apple cart once in a while and Mr 
                                              Justice J N K Taylor is no 
                                              exception. It is the combination 
                                              of all these that have gone to 
                                              make him the great judge he is.</span></p>

                                              legality, to build in this country

                                              culture of respect for law and 
                                              order. When individuals or

                                              institutions evince a tendency to 
                                              avoid and evade the law by 
                                              recourse to questionable 
                                              strategies, we must expose their 
                                              antics and not encourage them to 
                                              think that it is permissible to 
                                              have recourse to ingenious methods 
                                              to pre-empt the requirements of

                                              the confidence of the law abiding

                                              must appreciate that sycophancy 
                                              and pandering to the official view 
                                              is fast becoming fashionable and 
                                              often the common past-time of the 
                                              failures in our society who walk 
                                              the corridors of power, kowtowing 
                                              to officialdom, fawning for 
                                              favours and largesse and fanning 
                                              the flames of tendentious popular 
                                              views which they imagine the 
                                              wielders of power are probably 
                                              holding. It seems to me that every 
                                              leader we have had from the 
                                              indefatigable Nkrumah, to the 
                                              revolutionary J J have not been 
                                              isolated from these political 
                                              parasites, and the downfall of 
                                              many a leader can be traced to 
                                              over-dependence on their 
                                              irresponsible and selfish antics. 
                                              Perhaps we need an institutional 
                                              mechanism to protect our national 
                                              leaders from the dilemma posed by 
                                              the machinations of these 
                                              shameless ruffians. This is 
                                              necessary because by the 
                                              experience of hind-sight it is 
                                              possible to know the reality that 
                                              motivates and is behind these 
                                              merchants of evil and 
                                              nation-wreckers. Consider their 
                                              past exploits in studied 
                                              sycophancy and their slogan

                                              the horrors of the Nazi propaganda

                                              manipulate our leaders: Nkrumah is

                                              conclusion all that we can say is 
                                              that he is a great judge and that

                                              departure. We are happy, however, 
                                              in the knowledge that it is at the

                                              After over 30 years of my 
                                              association with the Bench and the 
                                              Bar I believe this is the first

                                              has been held by the Bar in honour

                                              Apaloo, but as far as I know the 
                                              functions in their case were not

                                              function, I was not told the form 
                                              it would take but suspecting I may

                                              had quite some difficulty in 
                                              selecting a theme, but after 
                                              reflection, I recall what on 9

                                              virtue that must be cultivated by 
                                              all lawyers whether they are on 
                                              the Bench or at the Bar. The story

                                              regrettable and unfortunate. It 
                                              seems that under a constitutional 
                                              government it is not difficult to 
                                              display courage on the Bench or at 
                                              the Bar especially as 
                                              constitutional guarantees of 
                                              judicial independence make it easy 
                                              to be fearless. It is under 
                                              military regimes that courage and 
                                              fearlessness in members of the 
                                              legal and judicial fraternity 
                                              become meaningful. In this 
                                              connection, I venture to think 
                                              that I am in a unique position to 
                                              offer some advice because of my

                                              can tell you from the experience I 
                                              have thus gathered, that in 
                                              working with military regimes I 
                                              discovered, what I believe is 
                                              little known outside restricted 
                                              government circles that soldiers

                                              take over governments are very 
                                              anxious to do the right thing; 
                                              they often strain hard not to do 
                                              anything that can be said to be 
                                              unlawful. It seems to me that the

                                              of this characteristic of the 
                                              military mind which in my view can 
                                              be favourably harnessed to the 
                                              advantage of this Republic. The 
                                              result of the failure to grasp 
                                              this, is that at virtually all the 
                                              periods of military rule, there 
                                              would seem to be hostility between 
                                              the military establishment and the 
                                              legal profession. But as I brace 
                                              myself to leave the judicial 
                                              scene, I feel I should draw 
                                              attention to this aspect of the 
                                              soldier-lawyer relationship in the 
                                              hope that a true appreciation of 
                                              this may promote better 
                                              understanding in the future.</span></p>

                                              the military, they thought the 
                                              courts were against them and that 
                                              the High Court was playing 
                                              politics and had entertained the 
                                              application to embarrass the 
                                              government. I had to explain that 
                                              the High Court was acting in this 
                                              manner “to fulfil and not to 
                                              destroy the law” as was said by 
                                              Smith J in Balogun v Edusei 
                                              ((1958) 3 WALR 547). I told them 
                                              that the court was anxious to find 
                                              out whether the military tribunal 
                                              which is a tribunal with limited 
                                              jurisdiction was operating within 
                                              the jurisdiction given it by NRCD 
                                              90, so that it would be called to 
                                              account if it was not doing what 
                                              NRCD 90 enjoined it to do. They 
                                              were surprised at the explanation 
                                              as they said they did not realise 
                                              that that was what the court was 
                                              attempting to do because they had 
                                              been given conflicting and 
                                              contrary advice.</span></p>

                                              to be obeyed is that its content

                                              application, and secondly its 
                                              content is generally not

                                              is consequently neither variable

                                              has been appreciated by many wise 
                                              men long before the christian era. 
                                              In his Politics, the great Greek 
                                              philosopher, Aristotle gave 
                                              consideration as to whether law or

                                              liable to be corrupted by passion. 
                                              We may conclude then, that the law 
                                              is reason without passion and it 
                                              is therefore preferable to any

                                              You see in Kipling’s description 
                                              here a concept of law as a 
                                              capricious instrument for ensuring 
                                              the paramountcy of individual 
                                              passion. But law as we have 
                                              operated it in our courts ensures 
                                              that the laws regulate the conduct 
                                              of all in the society without any 
                                              exception whatsoever. This concept 
                                              can be traced in Anglo-Ghanaian 
                                              jurisdiction in its embryonic

                                              Bracton. Henry of Bratton (Bracton)

                                              Bracton’s words ring true today

                                              when he first wrote them. Thus 
                                              when on one Sunday morning, 10 
                                              November 1608, King James I, in a

                                              treason to entertain the idea that 
                                              he was under the law, Lord Coke, 
                                              the Chief Justice, in the

                                              It is worth noting that 
                                              individuals like Coke have in the 
                                              exercise of judicial power blazed 
                                              a bold trial characterised by 
                                              intellectual integrity and an 
                                              inflexible faith in law as a 
                                              safeguard of human happiness. As a 
                                              judge, Coke came face to face with 
                                              executive powers of the highest 
                                              possible order. He made it 
                                              abundantly clear even to James I, 
                                              in a decision in the well-known 
                                              case of Proclamations that in 
                                              spite of his being King of all 
                                              Britain, nevertheless he could not 
                                              by Proclamation “make, a thing 
                                              unlawful which was permitted by 
                                              the law before.” (See 7 Coke 
                                              (1609), 63-65.) His basic 
                                              philosophy reflecting the 
                                              Bracton’s tradition in this 
                                              landmark decision in 1611 was that 
                                              the King had no prerogative but 
                                              that which the law and the land 
                                              follows.” And he insisted that the 
                                              judges and not the King were the 
                                              only authorised interpreters of 
                                              the law. (See Nicholas Fullers 
                                              Case (1608) 12 Col 41.) Such 
                                              spirits do not survive autocracy 
                                              and demagogy and so Coke’s career 
                                              as a judge came to an abrupt end 
                                              when true to his conscience, he 
                                              gave as it were a bold and 
                                              fearless dissenting opinion in the 
                                              best tradition of the exercise of 
                                              judicial responsibility in the 
                                              case of Commendans in 1616. (1616

                                              In that case the question which 
                                              was put before all the judges in 
                                              England, was whether in a case 
                                              pending before them, which the 
                                              King thought “to concern him 
                                              either in person or profit,” they 
                                              could be required to stay 
                                              proceedings till the King could 
                                              consult with them. With the 
                                              exception of Coke all the judges 
                                              answered “Yes.” Coke’s answer 
                                              defying fawning sycophancy and in 
                                              the best exercise of judicial 
                                              power under law was that “when 
                                              that case should be, he would do 
                                              that which befit for a judge to 
                                              do.” Shortly after this answer in 
                                              1616 Coke was removed as Chief

                                              the Special Criminal Division of 
                                              the High Court here in Accra, the 
                                              court presided over by Korsah CJ 
                                              with van Lare and Akufo-Addo JJSC, 
                                              acquitted three persons: Tawiah 
                                              Adamafio, Ako Adjei and the late 
                                              Cofie Crabbe of a charge of 
                                              conspiracy to commit treason 
                                              contrary to sections 23(1) and 
                                              180(1) of the Criminal Code, 1960 
                                              (Act 29) (see State v. Otchere 
                                              [1963] 2 GLR 463). It is 
                                              apparently the consensual view of 
                                              the legal profession that the 
                                              accused persons were acquitted 
                                              upon legally sound and 
                                              unimpeachable grounds. By the 
                                              Special Criminal Instrument, 1963 
                                              (EI 161), however, the acquittals 
                                              were, inter alia, declared null 
                                              and void and re-enacting Coker’s 
                                              experience of 1616, the Chief 
                                              Justice and his panel members were 
                                              removed as judges.</span></p>

                                              The reason for the removal of 
                                              Korsah CJ and his colleagues as 
                                              seeped through to us at the Law 
                                              Office at the time, was that the 
                                              Chief Justice should have 
                                              consulted the President, Dr Kwame 
                                              Nkrumah, for the sake of the 
                                              security of the State before 
                                              acquitting the accused: and so the 
                                              well-known aphorism that history 
                                              repeats itself found fulfilment on 
                                              our shores in an echo of the 1616 
                                              experience of Lord Coke. One can 
                                              only hope that our own judges in 
                                              the world of Coke like Korsah, van 
                                              Lare and Akufo-Addo have set 
                                              examples for us which we of this 
                                              generation must emulate and 
                                              transmit to the generation of 
                                              lawyers who will come after us. 
                                              This is one advice which I wish to 
                                              pass on to my brethren on the 
                                              Bench and my professional lawyer

                                              Before I am done, I wish to 
                                              seriously make mention of a matter 
                                              which we should endeavour never to 
                                              gloss over if we aspire to win the 
                                              confidence of the Ghanaian public 
                                              in our brand of justice. There are 
                                              many persons who believe rightly 
                                              or wrongly that we sell justice in 
                                              our courts to the highest bidders. 
                                              Quite clearly, at times this 
                                              auction accusation is made by 
                                              irresponsible litigants who have 
                                              lost their cases and are smarting 
                                              under a misconceived grievances; 
                                              but there surely are also great 
                                              number of persons who have not 
                                              lost any cases and who 
                                              nevertheless make like 
                                              accusations. This pervasive charge 
                                              of corruption needs to be tackled 
                                              boldly and honestly. I am unable 
                                              here and now to offer a solution, 
                                              but I think its ramification 
                                              should be firmly appreciated so 
                                              that it can urge us to think out 
                                              solutions.</span></p>

                                              In Ghana, the average person who 
                                              pays for a favour in litigation 
                                              informs his close friends “in 
                                              confidence” of what he has done. 
                                              The close friends as well inform 
                                              their close friends of what has 
                                              happened, also “in confidence”. 
                                              The tale empemistically called 
                                              rumour repeatedly told “in 
                                              confidence” continues and 
                                              progresses through a wide spectrum 
                                              of the society and the alleged 
                                              taker soon gets an ignominous 
                                              name. He ends up with a notorious 
                                              reputation and people shake their 
                                              head and carry on a whispering 
                                              campaign any time his name crops 
                                              up. Ultimately his evil deed does 
                                              catch up with him, and as night 
                                              follows day he finally pays the 
                                              price when he least expects to do 
                                              so.</span></p>
