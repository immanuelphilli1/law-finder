                                              Ever since human kind outlived the 
                                              &quot;state of nature&quot; the quest for 
                                              law and order as a necessary 
                                              precondition for functional social 
                                              existence has been—and continues 
                                              to be a passion.&nbsp; Thus as we 
                                              survey human societies over the 
                                              ages, we find a great variety of 
                                              social control mechanisms. My task 
                                              in this paper is to identify the 
                                              types of punishment which various 
                                              societies or epochs have meted out 
                                              to wrongdoers. As we survey the 
                                              penologies of various societies it 
                                              is clear that punishment resorted 
                                              to in society whether it be the 
                                              so-called primitive, barbaric or 
                                              civilised, are based on two-fold 
                                              considerations: (a) the assumed 
                                              damage of the anti-social act to 
                                              the group; and (b) the measure of 
                                              repayment that the social group 
                                              exacts.</span></p>

                                              Thus the taboos of primitive man 
                                              and the criminal codes of 
                                              civilised societies are both based 
                                              on the doctrine that punishment 
                                              can be found to fit the crime. It 
                                              is evident, however, that what 
                                              punishment fits what crime 
                                              invariably depends on a people's 
                                              concept of desirability, their 
                                              level of socio-economic 
                                              development and on their theories 
                                              of crime and responsibility.</span></p>

                                              In these societies, men had 
                                              precarious hold over their future. 
                                              Thus they were constantly in fear 
                                              of the ravages of the unknown and 
                                              the supernatural. Nothing stood 
                                              between them and the powers of 
                                              darkness except the well-beaten 
                                              path of custom. To use the 
                                              anthropologist's phrase, 
                                              &quot;traditional man's custom is his 
                                              luck.&quot; In this society, 
                                              transgression of the customary 
                                              codes thus exposed the offending 
                                              individual to untold woes and 
                                              besides rendered his whole social 
                                              group liable to the vengeance of 
                                              the gods, for responsibility was 
                                              collective. In this society also, 
                                              crime and sin were identical. 
                                              Hence to supplement the 
                                              individual’s fear of violating the 
                                              prescribed modes of conduct, on 
                                              account of the vengeance of unseen 
                                              powers, there is his certain 
                                              knowledge that his group will 
                                              revenge itself upon him for 
                                              rendering the groups liable to 
                                              destruction by spiritual forces.</span></p>

                                              Early traditional societies had 
                                              two classes of crimes though they 
                                              are indistinguishable in certain 
                                              circumstances: public crimes and 
                                              private crimes. The former are 
                                              those which touched the whole 
                                              social group and the latter were 
                                              wrongs against private 
                                              individuals. Given the collective 
                                              orientation of traditional 
                                              societies, its members would aid 
                                              in the repression of public 
                                              crimes; the adjudication of 
                                              private crimes was left to the 
                                              injured parties and their kinsmen. 
                                              Because traditional societies 
                                              thought that the most serious 
                                              disasters to society came from the 
                                              intervention of supernatural 
                                              agencies, it was natural for them 
                                              to regard as the most heinous 
                                              crimes those which violate the 
                                              customary rules for placating 
                                              these supernatural forces and 
                                              which exposed the whole group to 
                                              their relentless wrath.&nbsp; Of this 
                                              class of offences, by far the most 
                                              important was the violation of 
                                              some fundamental taboos which 
                                              governed the common code of 
                                              conduct.</span></p>

                                              Although there are many taboos in 
                                              early civilisations, perhaps the 
                                              most respected, since it furnished 
                                              the basis for the whole system of 
                                              relationship in tribal society was 
                                              the taboo against endogamy and 
                                              incest. Therefore its violation 
                                              was most severely punished. The 
                                              other major public crime of early 
                                              days was witchcraft or sorcery 
                                              which consisted in using magical 
                                              powers to bring disaster upon the 
                                              group and to secure individual 
                                              revenge or advantage, in effect 
                                              betraying the group to the mercy 
                                              of the evil spirits. Naturally, 
                                              the presence of such a person as a 
                                              sorcerer in the group was a source 
                                              of ever present and due cause for 
                                              panic in the social body.</span></p>

                                              and treason—were usually deemed of

                                              In early tribal societies the 
                                              punishment for committing public 
                                              great offences such as endogamy or 
                                              witchcraft was carried out with 
                                              severity; the offender was

                                              Among the Tasmanians, if a member 
                                              by his action gained the ill-will

                                              while they hurled spears at him. 
                                              These he took as best he could by 
                                              contortions of the body—a defence

                                              When the nature of the offence is 
                                              appraised from the viewpoint of 
                                              traditional people, their fury is 
                                              easily explainable.&nbsp; The 
                                              fierceness of the punishment is 
                                              the result not of a desire to 
                                              inflict pain upon the offender but 
                                              of eagerness to get rid of him and

                                              group being harmed by the powers 
                                              of darkness. There is also a 
                                              desire to placate the gods and 
                                              prove that the group would not 
                                              tolerate wrongdoing. The 
                                              punishment of a coward was usually 
                                              a gross humiliation, public 
                                              ridicule or corporal punishment 
                                              rather than death. Other public 
                                              crimes may be punished by 
                                              banishment or ostracisation.</span></p>

                                              Indeed, in tribal societies, it is 
                                              difficult to separate public 
                                              crimes from private ones

                                              punishment. In those societies, 
                                              every person belonged to a unitary 
                                              group, a clan or lineage with 
                                              mystical solidarity. Here, it was 
                                              thus a religious duty for each 
                                              clan to avenge summarily any wrong 
                                              against any of its members. The 
                                              basis of this blood feud 
                                              retaliation is the well-known lex

                                              murdered a member of another clan 
                                              exposed every member of his clan 
                                              including himself to the same 
                                              fate. His clan may, however, sue 
                                              for peace by giving away a member 
                                              of the clan.</span></p>

                                              stocks held the prisoner sitting 
                                              down with his feet and hands

                                              similarly caught. When these were

                                              their operation was chiefly 
                                              psychological as it exposed the

                                              In the early 1830s, prisoners were 
                                              often confined in their cell with 
                                              both their hands and feet fastened 
                                              by heavy chains to the sides, 
                                              ceiling or floor. It was not 
                                              uncommon for prisoners to be 
                                              chained in a reclining position 
                                              upon bars of iron and left in such 
                                              a position for days or weeks. 
                                              Prisoners were also chained 
                                              together at work or in cage wagons 
                                              at night. They may also be cuffed 
                                              to their cell doors as is the 
                                              practice in some modern penal 
                                              institutions. So much for corporal 
                                              punishment.</span></p>

                                              Capital punishment is the 
                                              infliction of the death penalty, 
                                              taking the life of a criminal 
                                              convicted of a serious crime. At 
                                              different times in history and

                                              this extreme penalty. While the

                                              few standard devices such as

                                              Flaying and impaling was widely 
                                              practised in the ancient Orient 
                                              and medieval Europe. This brutal 
                                              punishment meant just skinning the 
                                              victim alive and then placing his 
                                              body upon a sharp stake where he 
                                              remained until he died. Another 
                                              method of administering the death 
                                              penalty in the Orient was the 
                                              exposure of the individual to 
                                              gradual death from insect bites. 
                                              The victim might also be thrown to 
                                              lions or other ravenous beasts or 
                                              poisonous reptiles. Other methods 
                                              of administering the death penalty 
                                              include drowning, stoning, casting 
                                              from a high rock or precipice, 
                                              poisoning, burning at the stake or 
                                              in oil, starvation and

                                              punishment of offenders is through 
                                              institutionalised and 
                                              non-institutionalised methods. The

                                              and confinement to a

                                              norm. Although modern penological

                                              whether any other member of the 
                                              animal kingdom has ever shown such 
                                              cruelty and brutality as has homo 
                                              sapiens in dealing with the 
                                              criminal group. Let us end by

                                              thinking is humanistic in 
                                              orientation.&nbsp; It emphasises reform 
                                              and rehabilitation and not safe
