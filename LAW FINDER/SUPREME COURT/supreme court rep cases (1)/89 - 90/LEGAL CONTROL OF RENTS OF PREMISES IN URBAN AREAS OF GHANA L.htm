                                              issues of development.&nbsp; Most

                                              this problem.&nbsp; In the rapidly 
                                              urbanising&nbsp; countries of the 
                                              developing world - with their 
                                              rapidly increasing&nbsp; populations - 
                                              provision of affordable housing 
                                              has assumed particular importance. 
                                              Various measures have been adopted 
                                              towards this end.&nbsp; In some 
                                              countries massive programmes of

                                              undertaken. Several planning and

                                              been adopted. Another widely used

                                              This article examines the attempts 
                                              by the law maker to control the 
                                              rents of premises - particularly 
                                              residential accommodation through

                                              shall specifically be concerned 
                                              with the control of rents of 
                                              premises in urban Ghana.&nbsp; Our 
                                              focus will therefore not include 
                                              the rural areas.&nbsp; This is because 
                                              the nature of the housing sector 
                                              and the rental situation in the 
                                              urban areas is substantially 
                                              different from that in the rural 
                                              areas.&nbsp; The Living Standards 
                                              Survey,1 showed that whereas about

                                              and 46 per cent of households in 
                                              the other urban areas lived in

                                              per cent of households in the 
                                              rural areas lived in rented 
                                              accommodation. It must also be 
                                              pointed out that we shall be

                                              system of rent control involves a 
                                              legal limitation of the amount of 
                                              rent which landlords can lawfully 
                                              charge and receive from their 
                                              tenants. This is often 
                                              complemented with provisions 
                                              designed to offer greater security 
                                              of tenure to tenants by 
                                              restricting the circumstances 
                                              under which a landlord can 
                                              lawfully evict a tenant. This is 
                                              because the legal restrictions on 
                                              levels of rent are unlikely to be 
                                              effective if a landlord retains

                                              recover possession of his 
                                              premises.&nbsp; For example, at common 
                                              law, a periodic monthly tenancy 
                                              (which according to Alameddine 
                                              Bros v Paterson Zochonis2 is the 
                                              type of tenancy commonest in the 
                                              country) may be terminated by a

                                              Rent control has been resorted to

                                              The first point that must be noted 
                                              about the housing question in 
                                              urban Ghana is the rapid increase 
                                              in the population of the country 
                                              in the last half a century or so. 
                                              The population has increased from 
                                              4,118,000 in 1948 to 6,726,615 in 
                                              1960 to 8,559,313 in 1970 and to 
                                              12,296,081 in 1984. It is now 
                                              estimated at about 14 million.&nbsp; 
                                              The annual rate of growth of the 
                                              population is now estimated at 
                                              about 3.2 per cent. Even more 
                                              phenomenal is the increase in the

                                              urban areas. The number of people 
                                              living in urban Ghana (defined by 
                                              the censuses as a town of 5,000 or 
                                              more ) rose from 538,000 in 1948 
                                              to 1,551,000 in 1960 to 2,472,456

                                              one in which population growth and 
                                              urbanisation has led to quite a 
                                              severe housing crisis, as the rate 
                                              of housing production has failed 
                                              to keep pace with population 
                                              growth and urbanisation.&nbsp; Equally 
                                              important: it is clear that 
                                              private individuals are still the 
                                              key players - attempts at 
                                              socialising the market through 
                                              public building initiatives having 
                                              largely failed.&nbsp; It is against 
                                              this contextual background that we 
                                              shall examine the attempts to use 
                                              the law to control rents.&nbsp; </span>

                                              Attempts at controlling the level 
                                              of rent through the processes of 
                                              the law was introduced into this 
                                              country with the enactment of the 
                                              Defence (Rent Restriction) 
                                              Regulations of 1942 when war time 
                                              conditions shot up the levels of 
                                              rent and the prices of other 
                                              commodities. Since then the output 
                                              of the legislative machine in this 
                                              area has been enormous.&nbsp; But to 
                                              what effect? Two main approaches 
                                              have been adopted by the law-maker 
                                              since independence.&nbsp; The first has 
                                              involved the assessment of rent of 
                                              individual premises based on a 
                                              number of factors by rent 
                                              officers.&nbsp; Under this approach the 
                                              rent control legislation itself 
                                              does not specify any rent for any 
                                              type or class of premises.&nbsp; The 
                                              second approach has involved the 
                                              legislative fixing of standard 
                                              rents for particular types or 
                                              classes of premises particularly 
                                              at the middle and lower end of the 
                                              rental accommodation market.&nbsp; The 
                                              first approach is represented by 
                                              the Rent Act, 1963 (Act 220) which 
                                              has been the parent rent control 
                                              statute since 1963.&nbsp; </span></p>

                                              legislation in this long-running 
                                              saga is the Rent Control Law, 1982 
                                              (PNDCL 5). It applied to 
                                              residential premises only.59 
                                              Though it adopted the second

                                              end of the rental accommodation

                                              legislative mood of the times, its 
                                              approach was revolutionary.&nbsp; It 
                                              started by slashing rents of all 
                                              residential premises except those 
                                              below ¢20 per month to half of 
                                              that payable as at 31 December 
                                              1981.60&nbsp; It also provides that 
                                              rent for one room should not 
                                              exceed ¢20 per month61 and for a

                                              that contravention of the 
                                              provisions noted above rendered

                                              premises to the state.64&nbsp; The law 
                                              also requires that every landlord 
                                              shall issue each tenant with a

                                              The second approach - ie the 
                                              fixing of rigid standard rents or 
                                              the specification of upper limits 
                                              is considered by some as a better 
                                              or certainly more suitable and 
                                              effective method than the first 
                                              approach which, it has been noted, 
                                              proceeded on the basis of 
                                              assessment and determination of 
                                              rent for individual lettings.83&nbsp; 
                                              It has been argued that the 
                                              specification of rigid rents or 
                                              fixed upper limits simplifies the 
                                              enforcement of the rent control 
                                              mechanism because it enables 
                                              tenants to know what the landlord 
                                              cannot lawfully charge.84&nbsp; </span>

                                              This approach is however 
                                              questionable.85&nbsp; It tends to be 
                                              too rigid.&nbsp; Rent is legitimately 
                                              determined by a number of factors 
                                              which may vary from tenancy to 
                                              tenancy.86&nbsp; Thus though two 
                                              premises, houses, flats or rooms 
                                              may be of the same size and type, 
                                              they may be in different 
                                              neighbourhoods or locations, may 
                                              have different amenities, or be in 
                                              different states of maintenance or 
                                              repair or may be on different 
                                              floors.&nbsp; Various leases and 
                                              agreements may also offer varying 
                                              degrees of security to the tenant.</span></p>

                                              Secondly, some of the pieces of 
                                              legislation which adopted that 
                                              approach introduced too many 
                                              categories and distinctions.87&nbsp; 
                                              But the study of the operation of 
                                              law in society demonstrates that 
                                              distinctions between different 
                                              classes of cases inevitably makes 
                                              the law difficult to apply.&nbsp; This 
                                              is because arguments about 
                                              borderline cases arise and, the 
                                              provisions of the law can be 
                                              avoided or thwarted by the simple 
                                              expedient of moving out of the 
                                              specified category.&nbsp; For instance, 
                                              NRCD 158 was to apply only to 
                                              tenants who rented a single room 
                                              and had an annual income of not 
                                              more than ¢1,000.&nbsp; First, the 
                                              policy objective of the 
                                              requirement that the tenant should 
                                              be renting just a single room is 
                                              not clear. Secondly, determining 
                                              what is one-room and more 
                                              crucially, whose income does not 
                                              exceed ¢1,000 was unlikely to be 
                                              easy in all situations.88 Again, 
                                              PNDCL 5, as has been noted, 
                                              provided that where a landlord 
                                              charges more than ¢1,000 a month 
                                              for premises then he shall pay 50 
                                              per cent of the said rent to the 
                                              state as tax.&nbsp; A landlord who 
                                              charged ¢1,500 would therefore 
                                              only end up with ¢750.&nbsp; It 
                                              therefore meant that a landlord 
                                              who wanted to charge anything 
                                              between ¢1,000 and ¢1,999 was 
                                              better off charging ¢1,000 in 
                                              which case he was not liable to 
                                              this tax.</span></p>

                                              The strongest criticism of the 
                                              standard rent approach, however, 
                                              is that it is out of step with the 
                                              concrete realities of our economic 
                                              situation.&nbsp; Although most of these 
                                              pieces of legislation provided for 
                                              periodic reviews of the amount of 
                                              rent specified and the law can 
                                              generally be amended, most of the 
                                              specified rents were not reviewed 
                                              for considerable periods of time.&nbsp; 
                                              Thus, the First Schedule of NRCD 
                                              158, which came into force in 
                                              1973, was not amended until the 
                                              Decree was repealed in 1979.&nbsp; 
                                              During that period inflation rose 
                                              from an annual rate of 17 per cent 
                                              in 1973 to 73 per cent in 1978.&nbsp; 
                                              From 1976 to 1978 the annual rate 
                                              of inflation was more than 50 per 
                                              cent.&nbsp; Furthermore, from 1973 to 
                                              1978 prices in the economy as a 
                                              whole increased twelve-fold and 
                                              yet landlords of premises 
                                              controlled by NRCD 158 were still 
                                              required to charge a fixed 
                                              specified rent.&nbsp; Between 1979 and 
                                              1981, when AFRCD 5 was in 
                                              operation, the rate of inflation 
                                              averaged more than 50 per cent per 
                                              annum and the consumer price index 
                                              for these years shows that during 
                                              the period prices increased more 
                                              than three-fold.&nbsp; Again, landlords 
                                              were required to charge not more 
                                              than the rents specified in AFRCD 
                                              5.&nbsp; Between 1982 and 1986 when 
                                              PNDCL 5 was in operation the 
                                              consumer price index indicates 
                                              that prices within the economy 
                                              increased more than three-fold.89&nbsp; 
                                              And yet again rent of certain 
                                              types of premises were not to 
                                              exceed certain specified upper 
                                              limits which were not varied 
                                              during that period.&nbsp; And since 
                                              1986 when PNDCL 138 came into 
                                              force prices have about doubled.&nbsp; 
                                              But the rent of certain types of 
                                              premises remain the same.&nbsp; When 
                                              law is obviously ridiculous people 
                                              tend to ignore it and feel 
                                              justified in doing so.</span></p>

                                              Indeed, it is arguable that these 
                                              laws have aggravated the situation 
                                              by discouraging investment in the 
                                              rental housing sector.91&nbsp; The rate

                                              so low as to eliminate investment 
                                              in that sector as a purely 
                                              commercial proposition.92 It is 
                                              also likely that the maintenance

                                              stock has been adversely affected 
                                              by the legal controls.93&nbsp; 
                                              Furthermore, some landlords have 
                                              withdrawn their premises from the 
                                              rental sector particularly because 
                                              of the immense difficulty involved 
                                              in lawfully securing the eviction

                                              There has been a rather misplaced

                                              indirect, intended or unintended. 
                                              The time-frame within which the

                                              should also be chosen very

                                              Where then do we go from here?&nbsp; 
                                              There would seem to be no 
                                              blue-print or magic wand.&nbsp; Indeed, 
                                              a central thesis of this paper has 
                                              been that the law does not provide 
                                              any magic solution and - 
                                              presumably &quot;lawmen&quot; are not 
                                              magicians.&nbsp; The housing question 
                                              in urban Ghana is a complex 
                                              multi-dimensional problem.&nbsp; 
                                              Admittedly, it has legal aspects - 
                                              particularly those relating to 
                                              land tenure and administration and 
                                              its rules relating to access to 
                                              land, security of tenure, 
                                              mortgages, estate administration 
                                              and compulsory acquisition of 
                                              land, planning and zoning.&nbsp; But it 
                                              also has economic, demographic, 
                                              social, planning, architectural 
                                              and technological dimensions.&nbsp; At 
                                              the end of the day it is only an 
                                              increase in the housing stock and 
                                              therefore an improvement in the 
                                              housing situation that offers any 
                                              hope - and that would require 
                                              concerted and intensive, 
                                              integrated multi-disciplinary 
                                              action.&nbsp; Legal palliatives 
                                              designed in the abstract to deal

                                              of an impact.&nbsp; Law, like 'lawman,' 
                                              has its limitations.</span></p>

                                              been impossible for a landlord to

                                              where he has not provided the
