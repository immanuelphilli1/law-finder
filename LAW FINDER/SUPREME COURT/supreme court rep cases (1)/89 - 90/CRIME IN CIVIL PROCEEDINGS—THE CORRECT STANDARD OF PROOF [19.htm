                                              In the case of Ampadu v. Dankwah1 
                                              his lordship Abakah J posed this 
                                              question: &quot;what is the standard of 
                                              proof required to sustain fraud in 
                                              civil proceedings?&quot;&nbsp; In answering 
                                              the question, his lordship relied 
                                              on In re Agyepong (Decd.); Poku v. 
                                              Abosi2 where it was held that 
                                              fraud in civil proceedings 
                                              required a higher standard of 
                                              proof than an ordinary civil 
                                              matter; there must be proof of 
                                              criminal deception.&nbsp; Applying this 
                                              standard, the learned judge came 
                                              to the conclusion that in the case 
                                              before him, the allegation of 
                                              fraud had not been proved.&nbsp; The 
                                              purpose of this Comment is to 
                                              discuss the law relating to the 
                                              proper standard of proof in civil 
                                              proceedings where there is an

                                              Under English law it is well 
                                              established that only two 
                                              standards of proof are recognised. 
                                              In criminal cases, the prosecution 
                                              must prove the guilt of the 
                                              accused person beyond reasonable 
                                              doubt.&nbsp; In civil cases the 
                                              standard is the balance of 
                                              probabilities or preponderance of 
                                              probabilities.&nbsp; Needless to say 
                                              that the criminal standard is 
                                              higher than the civil one.&nbsp; The 
                                              English courts have not looked 
                                              favourably on attempts to create a 
                                              third standard lying between the 
                                              criminal and the civil 
                                              standards.3&nbsp; Until 1957, it was 
                                              not clear what the correct 
                                              standard of proof was in civil 
                                              proceedings where a party alleged 
                                              that a crime had been committed.&nbsp; 
                                              On the one hand, a line of 
                                              authorities held that the 
                                              appropriate standard&nbsp; was the 
                                              criminal one—beyond reasonable 
                                              doubt.4&nbsp; On the other, there were 
                                              authorities which held that the 
                                              normal civil standard of balance 
                                              of probabilities was the 
                                              appropriate one.5</span></p>

                                              In 1957 the English Court of 
                                              Appeal had the opportunity to 
                                              bring the debate to an end. It 
                                              decided in favour of the civil 
                                              standard&nbsp; or more accurately, a 
                                              standard within the civil one. In

                                              instance the judge applied the 
                                              balance of probability test on the 
                                              claim based on fraud and held that 
                                              the statement had been made.&nbsp; But 
                                              he noted that if the criminal 
                                              standard of proof had been applied 
                                              he would not have been so 
                                              satisfied.&nbsp; On appeal, the Court 
                                              of Appeal agreed with the learned 
                                              judge below.&nbsp; The case is 
                                              significant because it is 
                                              generally accepted as having 
                                              settled the issue on the correct 
                                              standard of proof.&nbsp; There are 
                                              important dicta in the judgment 
                                              worth drawing attention to for the 
                                              purposes of our discussion.&nbsp;

                                              which the judge took, namely, that

                                              fact that there is some difference 
                                              of approach in civil actions.&nbsp; 
                                              Particularly is this so if the 
                                              words which are used to define 
                                              that approach are the servants but 
                                              not the masters of meaning.&nbsp;

                                              such as fraud is alleged, is the 
                                              applicable standard in civil 
                                              actions generally, that is: proof

                                              and not the higher criminal 
                                              standard of proof beyond 
                                              reasonable doubt.&nbsp; Secondly, there 
                                              is no absolute standard as such in 
                                              either case. However, the degree 
                                              of probability must be 
                                              proportionate to the

                                              court was whether the husband or 
                                              the wife had died first.&nbsp; As the 
                                              evidence was not conclusive, the 
                                              husband being the elder, was

                                              a voyage from the United States to 
                                              Venezuela sank in 1973 and became 
                                              a total loss.&nbsp; It was alleged by 
                                              Lloyds' underwriter that the 
                                              vessel had been deliberately sunk

                                              or strongly suspected that the 
                                              vessel had, in fact, been 
                                              deliberately sunk.&nbsp; Finally, but 
                                              more comparatively, is the recent

                                              Indian and the other a Pakistani, 
                                              were alleged to have entered the 
                                              United Kingdom by practising fraud 
                                              or deception on immigration 
                                              officers and that they were 
                                              therefore &quot;illegal entrants.&quot; They 
                                              were ordered to be detained 
                                              pending summary removal. The House 
                                              of Lords held that the correct 
                                              standard of proof was that which 
                                              generally applied to civil 
                                              proceedings but the degree of 
                                              probability should be 
                                              proportionate to the nature and 
                                              gravity of the issue.&nbsp; It was 
                                              emphasised, especially by Lord 
                                              Scarman and Lord Fraser of 
                                              Tullybelton, that because the 
                                              liberty of the individual was at 
                                              stake the degree of probability 
                                              required should be high to the 
                                              satisfaction of the court.&nbsp; 
                                              Applying that standard, the House 
                                              of Lords held that the evidence 
                                              proved overwhelmingly that the 
                                              Pakistani had obtained entry 
                                              through deception on the 
                                              immigration officers and so his 
                                              appeal was dismissed.&nbsp; The appeal 
                                              of the Indian was allowed as the 
                                              evidence failed to prove that he 
                                              was guilty of deception.</span></p>

                                              follows:&nbsp; where there is an 
                                              allegation of a crime such as 
                                              fraud in a civil proceeding, the 
                                              correct standard of proof is that 
                                              used generally in civil matters, 
                                              namely, balance of the 
                                              probabilities.&nbsp; However, due 
                                              regard has to be paid to the

                                              a higher degree of probability is 
                                              to be applied within the general 
                                              civil standard.</span></p>

                                              It is interesting to note that 
                                              Australia actually took the lead 
                                              in this area of the law.&nbsp; As far 
                                              back as 1938, the High Court of 
                                              Australia (the highest judicial 
                                              body) laid down the law in 
                                              Briginshaw v Briginshaw;.17 In 
                                              that case the appellant-husband's 
                                              petition for divorce on the ground 
                                              of adultery was dismissed by the 
                                              trial judge because he was not 
                                              satisfied that adultery had been 
                                              proved beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; 
                                              The High Court of Australia held 
                                              that the appropriate standard of 
                                              proof was the civil standard. 
                                              However, due regard had to be 
                                              given to the seriousness of the 
                                              allegation. As Dixon J (as he then 
                                              was) pointed out:</span></p>

                                              &quot;It is often said that such an 
                                              issue as fraud must be proved 
                                              clearly, unequivocally, or 
                                              strictly or with certainty. This 
                                              does not mean that some standard 
                                              of persuasion is fixed 
                                              intermediate between the 
                                              satisfaction beyond reasonable 
                                              doubt required upon a criminal 
                                              inquest and the reasonable 
                                              satisfaction which in a civil 
                                              issue may, not must, be based on a 
                                              preponderance of probability. It 
                                              means that the nature of the issue 
                                              necessarily affects the process by 
                                              which reasonable satisfaction is 
                                              attained.&nbsp; When, in a civil 
                                              proceeding, a question arises 
                                              whether a crime has been 
                                              committed, the standard of 
                                              persuasion is, according to the 
                                              better opinion, the same as upon 
                                              other civil issues. But, 
                                              consistently with this opinion, 
                                              weight is given to the presumption 
                                              of innocence and exactness of

                                              of Australia in Rejfek v 
                                              McElroy.19 In that case the 
                                              appellants had sued the 
                                              respondents for the rescission of 
                                              a contract to purchase a milk run 
                                              in a suburb of Brisbane, and for 
                                              damages, because of fraudulently 
                                              untrue representations inducing 
                                              the contract. The trial judge, 
                                              sitting in the Supreme Court of 
                                              Queensland, gave judgment for the 
                                              defendants because he was not 
                                              satisfied beyond reasonable 
                                              doubt.&nbsp; Having examined the 
                                              leading authorities on the 
                                              subject, the High Court held that 
                                              in the absence of statutory 
                                              provisions to the contrary, proof 
                                              in civil proceedings of facts

                                              crime, had only to be established 
                                              on a balance of probabilities. It

                                              Ampadu v Dankwah (supra) it is

                                              administration to P was irregular 
                                              and fraudulent because, firstly, P

                                              wife married under the Ordinance, 
                                              and secondly, P did not disclose 
                                              that A had other wives and many 
                                              children. The trial judge ruled 
                                              that P had been fraudulent in her 
                                              application for the grant of 
                                              letters of administration and 
                                              therefore ordered the revocation 
                                              of the grant. The Court of Appeal 
                                              allowed the appeal concluding that 
                                              the evidence established 
                                              conclusively that at the time of 
                                              the marriage of P and A, the 
                                              latter had divorced all his other

                                              dictum of Denning LJ (as he then 
                                              was) in Bater v Bater.27a&nbsp; With 
                                              all due respect to her lordship, 
                                              it is our submission that her 
                                              statement of the law is 
                                              contradicted by the leading 
                                              authorities both in England and 
                                              Australia.&nbsp; In Bater v Bater 
                                              (supra), a wife appealed against a 
                                              commissioner's dismissal of her 
                                              petition for divorce on the ground 
                                              that the charges of cruelty made 
                                              by her were not proved beyond 
                                              reasonable doubt. A careful 
                                              reading of the Court of Appeal's 
                                              decision would disclose that Bater 
                                              v Bater could not be relied upon 
                                              as authority for a general 
                                              proposition that a crime such as 
                                              fraud requires &quot;proof of criminal 
                                              deception&quot; in a civil proceeding. 
                                              Although the court dismissed the 
                                              appeal, the learned judges seemed 
                                              to say that the term &quot;beyond 
                                              reasonable doubt&quot; was not used by 
                                              the commissioner with the same 
                                              strictness as it is used in 
                                              criminal jurisdiction.&nbsp; Denning LJ 
                                              explained that if the commissioner 
                                              had put the case higher and said 
                                              that the case had to be proved 
                                              with the same strictness as a 
                                              crime was proved in a criminal 
                                              court, then he would have 
                                              misdirected himself because that 
                                              would be the very error which the 
                                              Court of Appeal had corrected in 
                                              Davis v Davis.27b&nbsp; It would be 
                                              adopting too high a standard.&nbsp; The 
                                              divorce court, he said was a civil 
                                              court, not a criminal court, and 
                                              it should not adopt the rules and 
                                              standards of a criminal court.</span></p>

                                              &quot;It is true that by our law there 
                                              is a higher standard of proof in 
                                              criminal cases than in civil 
                                              cases, but this is subject to the 
                                              qualification that there is no 
                                              absolute standard in either case.&nbsp; 
                                              In criminal cases the charge must 
                                              be proved beyond reasonable doubt, 
                                              but there may be degrees of proof 
                                              within that standard.&nbsp; Many great 
                                              judges have said that, in 
                                              proportion as the crime is 
                                              enormous, so ought the proof to be 
                                              clear.&nbsp; So also in civil cases. 
                                              The case may be proved by a 
                                              preponderance of probability, but 
                                              there may be degrees of 
                                              probability within that standard.&nbsp; 
                                              The degree depends on the 
                                              subject-matter.&nbsp; A civil court, 
                                              when considering a charge of 
                                              fraud, will naturally require a 
                                              higher degree of probability than 
                                              that which it would require if 
                                              considering whether negligence 
                                              were established.&nbsp; It does not 
                                              adopt so high a degree as a 
                                              criminal court, even when it is 
                                              considering a charge of a criminal 
                                              nature, but still it does require 
                                              a degree of probability which is 
                                              commensurate with the occasion.&quot;29</span></p>

                                              Further and more curiously, is the 
                                              fact that in In re Agyepong 
                                              (Decd); Poku v. Abosi (supra), the 
                                              Ghana Court of Appeal did not 
                                              address itself to the cases of 
                                              Hornal v Neuberger Products Ltd 
                                              and Rejfek v McElroy (supra). As 
                                              we have already seen, those cases 
                                              not only clarified but indeed 
                                              settled the law in England and 
                                              Australia respectively. Moreover, 
                                              those cases have been followed in 
                                              a number of cases.&nbsp; Serious doubt 
                                              must now be cast on the value of

                                              From the foregoing discussion it 
                                              can be stated that the correct 
                                              standard of proof in civil 
                                              proceedings where there is an 
                                              allegation of a crime, or some 
                                              other grave matter, is: unless 
                                              there are statutory provisions to 
                                              the contrary, proof on the balance 
                                              of probabilities that is the 
                                              general civil standard. In the 
                                              Evidence Decree, 1975 (NRCD 323) 
                                              it is called &quot;a preponderance of 
                                              the probabilities.&quot;30&nbsp; However, 
                                              the degree of probability must be 
                                              proportionate to, or commensurate 
                                              with, the nature and gravity of 
                                              the particular allegation in 
                                              question.&nbsp; Thus where there is, 
                                              for example, an allegation of 
                                              minor assault, the degree of 
                                              probability need not be very 
                                              high.&nbsp; On the other hand, where 
                                              the allegation is that of fraud or 
                                              arson, the degree of probability

                                              after his death and there was no
