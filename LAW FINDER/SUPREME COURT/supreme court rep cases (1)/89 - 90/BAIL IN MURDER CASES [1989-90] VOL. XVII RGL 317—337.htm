                                              verbatim re-enactment of the 1969 
                                              provision in article 21(3)(b) and 
                                              (4) of the Constitution, 1979. One 
                                              would have thought that since 
                                              these provisions of the 
                                              Constitution, 1979, were 
                                              subsequent in time to the 
                                              enactment of section 96(7)(a) of 
                                              Act 30 the provisions of the 
                                              Constitution overrode the general 
                                              provisions of Act 30 as amended. 
                                              The spirit and letter of the 
                                              constitutional provisions would 
                                              appear to be inconsistent with and 
                                              repugnant to the limitations 
                                              sought to be placed on the 
                                              discretion of the court. The 
                                              overriding condition for granting 
                                              or withholding bail in all 
                                              criminal matters, one would have 
                                              thought, is whether there has been 
                                              unreasonable delay in trying or 
                                              commencing proceedings preliminary

                                              The recent decision of the High 
                                              Court in Republic v Crentsil4 
                                              appears to decide otherwise. It 
                                              also purports not only to lay down 
                                              the circumstances under which both 
                                              a pre-trial and a trial court may 
                                              grant bail in murder cases but 
                                              also the standard of evidence or 
                                              the evidential burden which the 
                                              prosecution must discharge to 
                                              avoid an adverse ruling against it 
                                              in an application for or against 
                                              bail. The decision further 
                                              purports to fill in what the 
                                              learned judge considered to be a 
                                              lacuna left by previous decisions 
                                              premised on section 96(7)(a) 
                                              dealing with murder cases. It is 
                                              therefore necessary to discuss how 
                                              the decision in Republic v 
                                              Crentsil helps us to appreciate 
                                              the previous decisions and the law 
                                              on the subject.</span></p>

                                              The facts of the case as stated in 
                                              the ruling are that, the accused 
                                              persons were charged with the 
                                              offence of murder. They were put 
                                              before a district court. The 
                                              district court without either 
                                              hearing or recording the facts 
                                              remanded the accused persons in 
                                              custody. This was to enable 
                                              investigations to be continued for 
                                              the prosecution to be able to tell 
                                              the court something on the next 
                                              adjourned date of 17 May 1988, a 
                                              very short time. This was also to 
                                              give the court the opportunity to 
                                              consult the authorities and come 
                                              out with a decision on the 
                                              question of bail. The accused 
                                              persons being dissatisfied with 
                                              the refusal of the district 
                                              magistrate to grant them bail, 
                                              applied to the High Court for 
                                              bail. In his affidavit supporting 
                                              the application the accused 
                                              averred that he had been charged 
                                              with the murder of his sister and 
                                              denied the charge. There was no 
                                              affidavit in opposition. The court 
                                              being sensitive to the right of 
                                              the individual and his liberty 
                                              granted him bail. The court 
                                              considered it dangerous and 
                                              reprehensible for a court to 
                                              remand an accused in custody in 
                                              circumstances where the 
                                              prosecution had either chosen not 
                                              to reveal to the court the grounds 
                                              for seeking to have him remanded 
                                              for investigations to continue or 
                                              chosen not to give the facts of 
                                              the case to enable the court to 
                                              properly exercise its discretion. 
                                              After bail was granted, the police 
                                              continued their investigations and 
                                              found traces of blood stains on 
                                              the wall in the bedroom of the 
                                              accused and which had been freshly 
                                              painted, and also on the door to 
                                              this room. The blood stains were 
                                              scrapped and sent to the forensic 
                                              laboratory for analysis of the 
                                              blood sample. The laboratory 
                                              analysis revealed the various 
                                              blood samples to be human blood of 
                                              group AB type which matched that 
                                              of the deceased. On the basis of 
                                              the forensic laboratory report the 
                                              Republic applied to the court to 
                                              rescind the bail earlier granted 
                                              on the grounds, inter alia, that 
                                              the first accused person was 
                                              involved in the matter or knew 
                                              more of the murder than he had 
                                              told the police. Consequently, the 
                                              accused should be taken into 
                                              custody to assist the police in 
                                              their investigations.</span></p>

                                              Upon the foregoing facts, the High 
                                              Court in its ruling treated the 
                                              matter as one requesting for 
                                              rescission or withdrawal of bail 
                                              in a murder case simpliciter under 
                                              section 96(7)(a) as distinct from

                                              96(5)(b)5 which justifies a

                                              dispute between the parties, made 
                                              to assume the hallmark of a 
                                              standard case of bail in murder 
                                              cases.7 In view of the fact that 
                                              the issue of bail in murder cases&nbsp; 
                                              has been a recurrent issue in our 
                                              courts, we would proceed to 
                                              examine this case as a specie of 
                                              those cases and thus contribute to 
                                              the on-going debate on the 
                                              subject. We would then conclude by 
                                              examining whether the case of 
                                              Republic v Crentsil can in fact be 
                                              said to have decided any legal 
                                              issues on bail in murder cases.</span></p>

                                              judge’s refusal to rescind bail in

                                              was no proper charge of murder 
                                              laid upon the evidence. The 
                                              evidence in his lordship’s view 
                                              did not establish all the 
                                              essential elements of the charge. 
                                              Consequently there was no case of

                                              In coming to the conclusion that 
                                              there was no proper charge or 
                                              murder laid upon the evidence, the 
                                              court stated that there were two 
                                              circumstances in which a court 
                                              might consider the issue to 
                                              pretrial bail: Firstly, on the 
                                              presentation of the facts to the 
                                              court in a summary trial and 
                                              secondly, in the summary of 
                                              evidence in a trial on indictment. 
                                              In both cases the test was the 
                                              same. The test we are told was 
                                              also the same but in a limited 
                                              sense, at the close of the case 
                                              for the prosecution. The decision 
                                              of the learned trial judge can 
                                              thus be reduced to the proposition 
                                              that: the issue of whether a 
                                              proper charge of murder has been 
                                              laid would depend on (a) the 
                                              presentation of the facts at a 
                                              summary trial, or (b) in the

                                              indictment either at the committal 
                                              proceedings at a bail court or at 
                                              the trial itself.</span></p>

                                              It is however trite learning that

                                              the offence of murder. The only 
                                              remote indication of the charge 
                                              before the district court was a

                                              how he came to discover the 
                                              dismembered body of his younger

                                              In his lordship’s view there was 
                                              no affidavit in opposition and the 
                                              respondents were deemed to have 
                                              admitted the denial of the 
                                              accused. The fact, however, still 
                                              remains that the ruling of the 
                                              learned High Court judge does not 
                                              disclose whether, in fact, the 
                                              charge denied in the affidavit was 
                                              one of murder or a non-capital 
                                              offence of manslaughter, causing 
                                              harm by means of offensive weapon 
                                              or other offence involving 
                                              unlawful harm not caught by 
                                              section 96(7)(a) of Act 30. It is 
                                              thus difficult to appreciate the 
                                              High Court’s ruling that the 
                                              accused person was charged with 
                                              murder albeit an improper charge 
                                              before the district court as 
                                              disclosed by the affidavit in 
                                              support of and in opposition to 
                                              the application for withdrawal of 
                                              the earlier bail. Admittedly 
                                              counsel for the respondent could 
                                              have argued that on the facts 
                                              disclosed in the affidavit in 
                                              support of the application the 
                                              accused could properly be charged 
                                              with murder in which case the 
                                              power of the court to grant bail 
                                              had been ousted. The bail earlier 
                                              granted had been overtaken by 
                                              events. It should therefore be 
                                              rescinded in view of the new 
                                              facts. But such a submission by 
                                              counsel for the Republic would by 
                                              no means be evidence that the 
                                              accused was charged with murder. 
                                              On the contrary it shows that the 
                                              Republic could in its discretion 
                                              charge the respondent with murder 
                                              or any other related or similar 
                                              offence. It is our submission that 
                                              the only appropriate conclusion to 
                                              draw from the affidavit of the 
                                              Republic and the arguments in 
                                              support thereof is that the 
                                              accused persons were put before 
                                              the district court for the purpose 
                                              of being remanded in custody to 
                                              enable the police to continue with 
                                              investigations. The application 
                                              before the High Court for 
                                              withdrawal of bail was upon new 
                                              facts disclosed by police 
                                              investigations while the accused 
                                              was on the court’s bail and it had 
                                              become “very necessary for the 
                                              accused to be taken into custody 
                                              to assist the police in their 
                                              investigations.”</span></p>

                                              It is further submitted that the 
                                              facts disclosed by the ruling of 
                                              the High Court did not raise the 
                                              issue of a proper charge of 
                                              murder. His lordship’s own ruling 
                                              did not find that a bill of 
                                              indictment and summary of evidence 
                                              were furnished to ground a charge 
                                              as required by law to enable the 
                                              district court consider whether or 
                                              not the charge was proper. The 
                                              district court was not therefore 
                                              in a position to exercise its 
                                              discretion to remand the accused 
                                              on a murder charge. This may 
                                              explain why the district court 
                                              remanded the accused to enable the 
                                              prosecution to tell the court 
                                              “something” within a very short 
                                              time. The district magistrate also 
                                              undertook to look up the 
                                              authorities (within the short time 
                                              of remanding the accused) on bail 
                                              in the circumstance it found 
                                              itself.10 It is also suggested 
                                              that even if the district court 
                                              purported to be trying a murder 
                                              case in refusing bail, the 
                                              decision of the district court was 
                                              challengeable not by an 
                                              application for bail to the High 
                                              Court but by an application for 
                                              certiorari. In arriving at this 
                                              conclusion one may take cognisance 
                                              of the fact that the High Court 
                                              has on a number of occasions 
                                              entertained applications for bail 
                                              from district court on the basis 
                                              of charge sheets purporting to 
                                              charge accused persons with the 
                                              indictable offence of murder. Prah 
                                              v The Republic11 and Seidu v The 
                                              Republic12 have often been quoted 
                                              as authority for the proposition 
                                              that the peremptory requirements 
                                              of section 96(7)(a) can only be 
                                              evoked when the charge laid before 
                                              a district court is a proper 
                                              charge of murder. Both cases were 
                                              quoted with approval in the 
                                              Crentsil case. A brief discussion 
                                              of those cases will assist our 
                                              appreciation of the Crentsil case.</span></p>

                                              Republic argued that section 
                                              96(7)(a) prohibited the grant of 
                                              bail by the court. It was held 
                                              that the claim of the applicant 
                                              deposed to in their affidavit in

                                              charged with murder and since the 
                                              application was not opposed on the 
                                              merits it would be granted. The 
                                              application would thus appear to 
                                              have been granted on the technical 
                                              basis of default of pleadings 
                                              which made it impossible for the 
                                              court to go into the real merits 
                                              of the application.</span></p>

                                              In Seidu v The Republic the 
                                              applicants were granted bail by 
                                              the district court. The Republic 
                                              successfully applied to the High 
                                              Court for an order of certiorari. 
                                              After nine months of police 
                                              investigations without discovering 
                                              any material evidence to create a 
                                              nexus between the applicants and 
                                              the murder, the applicant applied 
                                              to the High Court for an order of 
                                              certiorari to quash the order 
                                              granting bail. The issue before 
                                              the court was whether (a) despite 
                                              the mandatory provisions of 
                                              section 96(7)(a) of the Criminal 
                                              Procedure Code, 1960 (Act 30) as 
                                              amended, the court could in the 
                                              absence of evidence supporting the 
                                              charge of murder, grant bail and 
                                              (b) who had the right to decide 
                                              whether a case was one of murder 
                                              or some allied crime. It was held, 
                                              inter alia, that any person 
                                              preferring a charge under a 
                                              criminal statute must be quite 
                                              sure that the offence charged was 
                                              within the letter of the law. It 
                                              was unbelievable that the 
                                              legislature by section 96(7)(a) of 
                                              Act 30 intended the courts to 
                                              refuse bail to persons against 
                                              whom no proper charge of murder 
                                              had been preferred. The assumption 
                                              was that the legislature had not 
                                              intended what was inconvenient or 
                                              unreasonable. Those whom the 
                                              legislature intended section 96 of 
                                              Act 30 to cover were those against 
                                              whom, the charge of murder 
                                              preferred could be said by the 
                                              court to be properly supported by 
                                              the evidence which the prosecution 
                                              professed to have got and not 
                                              against persons whom there was no 
                                              legally acceptable evidence 
                                              connecting them with the charge of 
                                              murder. The provisional charge of 
                                              murder against the applicants, it 
                                              was further held, was unknown to 
                                              the criminal law of Ghana even 
                                              though that phrase was often heard 
                                              in and around our courts without 
                                              justification and explanation. 
                                              Consequently, the court decided 
                                              that there was no proper charge of 
                                              murder preferred against the 
                                              applicants.</span></p>

                                              In both Prah v The Republic and 
                                              Seidu v The Republic one of the 
                                              main grounds for granting bail was 
                                              that there was no proper charge of 
                                              murder preferred against the 
                                              applicants. These two cases did 
                                              not specifically decide the issue 
                                              of a purported charge of murder 
                                              before a district court which was 
                                              not on indictment. It is however 
                                              submitted that any murder charge 
                                              brought before a district court 
                                              which is not by virtue of the 
                                              service of a bill of indictment 
                                              and summary of evidence as 
                                              required by the procedure for 
                                              indicting an accused person is not 
                                              a proper charge of murder. Any 
                                              decision taken thereon by a 
                                              district court could be quashed by 
                                              certiorari. It is the duty of 
                                              counsel or the accused to submit&nbsp; 
                                              and request that he should be 
                                              discharged by the district 
                                              court.13 The failure of counsel to 
                                              raise a preliminary objection to 
                                              the jurisdiction of the court 
                                              below does not confer on that 
                                              court a bail jurisdiction from 
                                              which a High Court may exercise a 
                                              reviewing power of granting or 
                                              refusing bail. The grant of bail 
                                              by a High Court will mean that the 
                                              accused was properly before the 
                                              court below and could appear 
                                              before it for his case to be 
                                              properly disposed of. This 
                                              definitely introduces a 
                                              contradiction because if the 
                                              charge was improper the accused 
                                              ought to be discharged and not 
                                              granted bail. The only method to 
                                              effect such a discharge in our 
                                              view is to come by way of 
                                              certiorari to have the decision 
                                              and proceedings of the court below 
                                              quashed. A person cannot be on 
                                              bail on an improper charge of an 
                                              offence.14 It is consequently 
                                              submitted that the learned bail 
                                              judges in both Republic v Crentsil 
                                              and Prah v The Republic erred in 
                                              assuming that in the absence of a 
                                              proper indictment of the accused 
                                              of murder, the district court had 
                                              jurisdiction to hear a case of 
                                              murder based on an ordinary charge 
                                              sheet. Such a charge sheet would 
                                              be unknown to the process of 
                                              pre-trial adjudication on 
                                              indictment in our jurisprudence to 
                                              justify recourse to section 
                                              96(7)(a) of Act 30. Osei-Hwere J 
                                              (as he then was) appreciated this 
                                              in Donkor v The Republic. In that 
                                              case the applicant was charged 
                                              before a district court with 
                                              subversion contrary to section 1 
                                              of the Subversion Decree, 1972 (NRCD 
                                              90) and remanded in custody. In 
                                              granting bail to the accused the 
                                              High Court held that the charge 
                                              being one of subversion the 
                                              district court had no jurisdiction 
                                              to entertain it. In coming to that 
                                              conclusion the learned judge 
                                              stated that an inferior court was 
                                              not presumed to have any 
                                              jurisdiction except that which was 
                                              expressly provided and the civil 
                                              courts both superior and inferior 
                                              were completely divested of 
                                              jurisdiction to try an offence 
                                              under the Subversion Decree, 1972. 
                                              The vaunted expression 
                                              “provisional charge” whatever its 
                                              legal basis and claim of 
                                              convenience, in the opinion of the 
                                              judge, could not be proffered as a 
                                              means of conferring on a district 
                                              court jurisdiction to which it had 
                                              no claim. Regrettably, however, 
                                              all that the judge could do was to 
                                              grant bail even though he had, in 
                                              fact, declared the proceedings 
                                              before the district court to be 
                                              illegal, ultra vires and void. 
                                              Since the accused in all these 
                                              cases were not discharged, one may 
                                              ask whether they would not have 
                                              been liable to bench warrants if 
                                              they failed to appear at the next 
                                              adjourned date before the district 
                                              courts which had been declared to 
                                              have no jurisdiction. It is our 
                                              submission that in such cases 
                                              counsel is entitled to use the 
                                              process of certiorari instead of 
                                              an application for bail because 
                                              the facts would clearly not be a 
                                              proper case of bail but excess of 
                                              jurisdiction.15 On the foregoing, 
                                              we submit that it can be said with 
                                              certainty that despite the powers 
                                              of a district court to commit an 
                                              accused person for trial on 
                                              indictment for murder, neither the 
                                              Criminal Code nor the Criminal 
                                              Procedure Code confers on a 
                                              district court jurisdiction to 
                                              grant pre-trial bail on a charge 
                                              of murder simpliciter.</span></p>

                                              We are however of the view that a 
                                              district court or a circuit court, 
                                              as the case may be, has 
                                              jurisdiction to assist in the 
                                              arrest and detention of murder 
                                              suspects for the purpose of 
                                              preventing such suspects who “may 
                                              interfere with any witnesses or 
                                              evidence, or in any way hamper 
                                              police investigation.” Once a 
                                              suspect is brought before a 
                                              district court on any process or 
                                              after being arrested without 
                                              warrant and the Republic adduces 
                                              evidence to show that the suspect 
                                              may do any of the acts quoted 
                                              above the court may remand the 
                                              suspect. He need not be charged if 
                                              in fact police investigations have 
                                              not yet established the requisite 
                                              degree of evidence for the 
                                              preferment of a proper charge. It 
                                              is for these reasons that we are 
                                              of the view that the decision in 
                                              Republic v Crentsil that a case of 
                                              murder had not been objectively 
                                              made out on the application 
                                              because the affidavits before him 
                                              did not disclose an objective 
                                              evidence of murder was, with due 
                                              respect, erroneous. On the judge’s 
                                              own ruling bail is to be 
                                              objectively determine on the facts 
                                              presented in a summary of evidence 
                                              in committal proceedings or a 
                                              trial on indictment. None of the 
                                              two conditions existed in the 
                                              Crentsil case to warrant the 
                                              reliance of the court on affidavit 
                                              evidence to test or analyse the 
                                              facts presented or the summary of 
                                              evidence.16</span></p>

                                              The court in Republic v Crentsil 
                                              also held, among other things that 
                                              a bail court was the proper body 
                                              to decide whether or not a murder 
                                              charge preferred against an 
                                              accused disclosed a case of murder 
                                              to warrant his being remanded in 
                                              custody as required by section 
                                              96(7)(a). Roger Korsah J whose 
                                              decision in Seidu v The Republic 
                                              was adopted by the court in the 
                                              Crentsil case had earlier held 
                                              that the issue as to whether a 
                                              case was one of murder or some 
                                              other crime had to be determined 
                                              objectively by the court. He said 
                                              that although the prosecution had 
                                              to decide what charge it would 
                                              prefer against a suspect, it was 
                                              the duty of the court to decide 
                                              whether the case was one of murder 
                                              or some other crime by considering 
                                              the evidence in support of the 
                                              charge. A case would not be 
                                              considered a murder case until it 
                                              had been decided to be so by the 
                                              court having jurisdiction to try 
                                              it. He decided therefore that the 
                                              legislature was by the provision 
                                              of section 96(7)(a) ordering the 
                                              court to refuse bail in all cases 
                                              where there was evidence in 
                                              support of the accusation of 
                                              murder. Taylor J (as he then was) 
                                              had in Okoe v The Republic raised 
                                              the issue whether the section 
                                              could operate to oust the 
                                              jurisdiction of the High Court in 
                                              a situation where a man was held 
                                              ostensibly on a murder charge in a 
                                              case where the police had no 
                                              evidence whatsoever, even of a 
                                              prima facie nature, to connect the 
                                              man with the alleged murder. He 
                                              did not feel called upon to decide 
                                              the issue at the time, whether 
                                              this hypothetical situation would 
                                              be a murder case within he 
                                              contemplation of section 
                                              96(7)(a).17 Roger Korsah J found 
                                              the court to be the appropriate 
                                              body to answer that question on 
                                              the appropriate occasion provided 
                                              by Seidu v. The Republic. The bail 
                                              court in Republic v. Crentsil did 
                                              not only apply the decision of 
                                              Roger Korsah J but went on to 
                                              indicate the evidential burden on 
                                              the prosecution at the bail court. 
                                              There must be a prima facie case 
                                              or a case to answer else bail 
                                              would be granted on the basis that 
                                              the charge was not properly laid. 
                                              Roger Korsah J on the other hand 
                                              anchored his decision on the fact 
                                              that a provisional charge of 
                                              murder was unknown to our laws.18 
                                              He said that if the legislature 
                                              had said in every case where a 
                                              charge of murder was preferred 
                                              against the person the court shall 
                                              refuse bail, he would concede that 
                                              the power of the court would have 
                                              been completely ousted. In Brefor 
                                              v. The Republic, Taylor J, as he 
                                              then was, finally answered the 
                                              question left open in Okoe v The 
                                              Republic by deciding that the 
                                              court was the proper body to 
                                              decide whether an accusation was a 
                                              case of murder after examining the 
                                              bill of indictment and the summary 
                                              of evidence and not the 
                                              affidavits.</span></p>

                                              The issue of who is to decide 
                                              whether a case is one of murder to 
                                              oust the jurisdiction of the court 
                                              for purposes of bail would appear 
                                              to have arisen because of the 
                                              wording of section 96(7)(a), ie: 
                                              “in a case of murder” instead of 
                                              “on every charge of murder.” Under 
                                              section 96(7)(a) the requirement 
                                              that a court shall refuse to grant 
                                              bail in a case of treason, 
                                              subversion, murder, etc appear to 
                                              be so fluid as to open itself to 
                                              the different interpretations 
                                              placed on the words “in a case of” 
                                              by the prosecution and the 
                                              courts.19 It is arguable that a 
                                              case of murder is one in which the 
                                              jury&nbsp; has returned a verdict of 
                                              murder after the summing up. The 
                                              trial court in the sense used by 
                                              Roger Korsah J in Seidu v The 
                                              Republic will not be a bail court 
                                              but the trial court which can 
                                              decide whether a case is one of 
                                              murder or some other crime within 
                                              the jurisdiction of the court and 
                                              the jury. A decision by a 
                                              pre-trial court, sitting as a bail 
                                              court, that on the evidence a case 
                                              is not one of murder would amount 
                                              to acquitting the accused person 
                                              by a subterfuge at bail court and 
                                              thus usurping the powers of the 
                                              trial court in murder trials. A 
                                              bail court’s duty is not to find 
                                              out whether there is a case for 
                                              the accused to answer but whether 
                                              in view of section 96 of Act 30 an 
                                              accused ought to be granted bail. 
                                              The merits or otherwise of the 
                                              charge, indictment or case is not 
                                              in issue at that stage. Once the 
                                              bail court begins to determine by 
                                              extensive analysis of evidence 
                                              whether or not there is a case for 
                                              the accused to answer or a prima 
                                              facie case has been made out, it 
                                              assumes the duties and functions 
                                              of a trial court which it is 
                                              not.20 In this sense we agree with 
                                              Dr E V O Danquah that the learned 
                                              trial judge in Republic v Crentsil 
                                              had exceeded his functions as a 
                                              bail court in the analysis and 
                                              examination he undertook to 
                                              determine whether the accused was 
                                              properly charged with murder.21 As 
                                              we noted earlier, we are of the 
                                              opinion that even if the bail 
                                              court were the proper body to 
                                              decide what a case of murder is, 
                                              the learned judge erred in 
                                              deciding the case without a bill 
                                              of indictment and summary of 
                                              evidence. Taylor J raised the 
                                              issue of a man against whom there 
                                              was no evidence on a charge of 
                                              murder, even of a prima facie 
                                              nature and held in Okoe v The 
                                              Republic that it was not the 
                                              province of a bail court to 
                                              pronounce on the guilt of an 
                                              accused person. By the same 
                                              reasoning we submit that it is not 
                                              the province of a bail court to 
                                              pronounce on the innocence of an 
                                              accused person as the court tried 
                                              to do in Republic v Crentsil.</span></p>

                                              We are of the view that the 
                                              legislature, intended by section 
                                              96(7)(a), that a court shall 
                                              refuse to grant bail on every 
                                              charge of murder. We have argued 
                                              that the interpretation placed on 
                                              the words “in a case of murder” 
                                              and “in a murder case” also pose 
                                              problems of finding out the 
                                              intention of the legislature. The 
                                              High Court itself cannot agree on 
                                              the interpretation of section 
                                              96(7)(a) of Act 30. The appellate 
                                              courts have not borken the 
                                              impasse.22 The law therefore 
                                              cannot be said to be unambiguous 
                                              in its present state. Our view of 
                                              section 96(7)(a), we must admit, 
                                              could have the tendency of working 
                                              hardship on accused persons who 
                                              are eventually found not guilty. 
                                              But our criminal justice system 
                                              has conferred on the 
                                              Attorney-General, a quasi-judicial 
                                              officer, the power of deciding 
                                              whether or not to indict a party. 
                                              Sections 55 and 58 of Act 30 
                                              contain safeguards to ensure that 
                                              the power is exercised only by 
                                              responsible officers of the court. 
                                              There is no basis to suggest that 
                                              if the Attorney-General and those 
                                              to whom power is delegated to sign 
                                              indictments are true to the 
                                              honourable profession of the law a 
                                              party would be indicted 
                                              capriciously.23 Be that as it may, 
                                              it is our humble suggestion that 
                                              the foregoing discussions show 
                                              that our law on bail, particularly 
                                              section 96(7) if it is still 
                                              operative, needs to be reviewed. 
                                              In doing this recourse could be 
                                              had to the Bail Act, 1976, and the 
                                              Magistrates’ Courts Act, 1980,

                                              The foregoing discussions in as 
                                              far as they relate to the case of 
                                              Republic v Crentsil have proceeded 
                                              on the assumption that the accused 
                                              person had been properly charged 
                                              with murder and therefore bail 
                                              ought to be withdrawn or 
                                              rescinded. The facts as deposed to 
                                              in the applicant’s affidavit and 
                                              quoted extensively by the court 
                                              show clearly that the relief 
                                              sought was not premised on a 
                                              charge of murder. Admittedly, 
                                              paragraph 7 of the Republic’s 
                                              affidavit which the court 
                                              curiously chose to emphasise and 
                                              upon which the whole ruling was 
                                              premised stated that the accused 
                                              person knew more about the matter 
                                              or the murder than he had told the 
                                              police. That paragraph cannot be 
                                              interpreted to mean that the 
                                              accused person had committed the 
                                              offence of murder. In fact the 
                                              paragraph speaks of knowing more 
                                              about the matter or the murder. It 
                                              was thus at best highly 
                                              speculative which explains the 
                                              definite request made in paragraph 
                                              8 of the affidavit that it was 
                                              very necessary that the accused 
                                              person “be taken into custody to 
                                              assist the police in their 
                                              investigations.”</span></p>

                                              It is trite learning that a court 
                                              must try cases and give judgment 
                                              upon the facts disclosed on the 
                                              pleadings and upon the issues 
                                              joined on those facts.24 A court 
                                              may make comments on issues not 
                                              specifically raised but which are 
                                              collateral to the main facts and 
                                              issues. When a court fails to make 
                                              a decision or render judgment on 
                                              the facts and issues in the

                                              judgment can be said to be a 
                                              nullity.25 The court could be said

                                              The learned judge in the Crentsil 
                                              case thought it regrettable that 
                                              Taylor J (as he then was) did not 
                                              feel called upon to decide the 
                                              hypothetical issue of a man held 
                                              ostensibly on a murder charge in a 
                                              case where the police had no 
                                              evidence whatsoever, even of a 
                                              prima facie nature to connect him 
                                              with the alleged murder. But there 
                                              is no doubt that Taylor J 
                                              realised, rightly, that the facts 
                                              deposed to in both affidavits for 
                                              and against the application in 
                                              Okoe v The Republic did not call 
                                              upon him to decide the 
                                              hypothetical issue as to whether 
                                              the case would be a murder case 
                                              within the contemplation of 
                                              section 96(7)(a). Anglo-Ghanaian 
                                              jurisprudence requires that courts 
                                              decide real and existing disputes 
                                              or accrued causes of action and 
                                              not speculative or hypothetical 
                                              cases. Unfortunately the learned 
                                              bail judge in the Crentsil case 
                                              missed Taylor J’s appreciation of 
                                              the duty of judicial 
                                              self-restraint which enjoins 
                                              judges not to decide hypothetical 
                                              issues. When the opportunity 
                                              presented itself in Dogbe v The 
                                              Republic26 Taylor J, as he then 
                                              was, did in fact decide that the 
                                              provisions of section 96(7)(a) of 
                                              Act 30 as amended by NRCD 309 were 
                                              mandatory and imperative. They 
                                              ousted the hitherto 
                                              unquestionable, ancient and 
                                              time-honoured jurisdiction of the 
                                              courts to grant bail to persons 
                                              accused of crime when the case 
                                              was, inter alia, even of murder. 
                                              As the case did not fall within 
                                              the constitutional purview of 
                                              “unreasonable delay” in trying the 
                                              accused person he dismissed the 
                                              application. In Brefor v The 
                                              Republic, Taylor revisited the 
                                              issue of when bail might be 
                                              granted in spite of section 
                                              96(7)(a). He was content to look 
                                              at the bill of indictment and the 
                                              summary of evidence and decide 
                                              without any elaborate analysis 
                                              which might prejudice a decision 
                                              at the trial that prima facie, it 
                                              was a murder case. Unfortunately 
                                              in Republic v Crentsil the court’s 
                                              attention was not drawn to 
                                              Taylor’s decision expressing his 
                                              views on deciding hypothetical 
                                              issues.</span></p>

                                              the facts disclosed by the 
                                              Republic’s affidavit the accused 
                                              person ought to be taken into 
                                              custody to assist the police in 
                                              their investigations. The 
                                              Republic’s case was that new facts 
                                              had emerged which warranted the 
                                              rescission of bail. The court 
                                              unfortunately failed or refused to 
                                              decide the issues required of it 
                                              by the application. The court 
                                              cannot therefore be said to have 
                                              decided a case of bail in murder 
                                              cases as the decision in that 
                                              respect was speculative, 
                                              hypothetical and offends against 
                                              Anglo-Ghanaian criminal justice 
                                              and adversarial system of dispute 
                                              resolution. The purported decision 
                                              is not, with respect, an obiter 
                                              dictum as no ratio decidendi can 
                                              even be discovered on the issues 
                                              raised by the Republic.</span></p>

                                              In Brefor v The Republic Taylor J 
                                              (as he then was) posed by way of 
                                              obiter, the question whether on 
                                              the coming into force of the 
                                              Constitution, 1979, on 24 
                                              September 1979, section 96(7)(a) 
                                              of Act 30 could co-exist with 
                                              article 21 (3)(b) and (4)(a). He 
                                              conceded that this problem would 
                                              be raised in sharp relief with the 
                                              coming into force of the 
                                              Constitution. He however hazarded 
                                              the opinion that the most casual 
                                              consideration of the problem would 
                                              reveal that it was impossible by 
                                              any process of interpretation to 
                                              contend that the constitutional 
                                              provisions repealed section 
                                              96(7)(a) of Act 30. However, we 
                                              are inclined to agree with the 
                                              decision of Osei-Hwere J (as he 
                                              then was) in Donkor v The Republic 
                                              that the constitutional provision 
                                              in respect of bail for 
                                              unreasonable delay did not survive 
                                              the Constitution, 1969. The only 
                                              provisions which survived were 
                                              those specifically saved by the 
                                              Proclamation, 1972. We share the 
                                              views of Osei-Hwere J that article 
                                              15(3)(b) and (4)(b) cannot be said 
                                              to be rules of law which survived 
                                              the Constitution. It is also our 
                                              view that section 96(7) did not 
                                              survive article 21(3)(b) and 
                                              (4)(a) of the Constitution, 197927 
                                              because that provision is 
                                              inconsistent with the spirit and 
                                              letter of the fundamental human 
                                              rights provisions of the said 
                                              Constitution. The fundamental 
                                              human rights provisions of the 
                                              Constitution evinced an intention 
                                              not to discriminate against 
                                              persons suspected of the 
                                              commission of a crime. It 
                                              therefore promulgated article 
                                              21(3)(b) and (4)(a) making 
                                              unreasonable delay a mandatory 
                                              condition for which an accused 
                                              person who is arrested, restricted 
                                              or detained and is not tried shall 
                                              be granted bail. By purporting to 
                                              place a bar in special cases on 
                                              accused persons from being granted 
                                              bail, section 96(7)(a) 
                                              discriminates against those 
                                              suspects or accused persons. 
                                              Article 21(3)(b) and (4)(a) is a 
                                              specific provision which is 
                                              subsequent in time to section 
                                              96(7)(a) of Act 30, which is a 
                                              general provision.28 The latter 
                                              provision should therefore be 
                                              deemed to have been amended. 
                                              Should our submission be the 
                                              correct view, then it can be said 
                                              that with the abrogation or 
                                              suspension of the Constitution, 
                                              1979, the provisions of article 
                                              21(3)(b) and (4)(a) of the 
                                              Constitution not having been 
                                              specifically continued in 
                                              existence by the Proclamation, 
                                              1981 is inoperative. It stands to 
                                              reason that the only statutory 
                                              provisions applicable to bail are 
                                              section 96(1) to (6) of the 
                                              Criminal Procedure Code as amended 
                                              by NRCD 309. The court in Republic 
                                              v Crentsil would thus have been in 
                                              error even in purporting to decide 
                                              on section 96(7)(a) in a case or 
                                              on a charge of murder.</span></p>

                                              on concern for the liberty of the 
                                              individual. A court of law has a 
                                              duty to maintain the scales of 
                                              justice evenly between the state 
                                              and the individual. A court should 
                                              not unjustifiably refuse to decide 
                                              whether the state should in&nbsp; a

                                              investigations. If a court does 
                                              this it will be disabling the 
                                              state from discharging its duty of 
                                              ensuring the safety of the life 
                                              and property among the 
                                              body-politic. The well-intentioned 
                                              desire to uphold and secure the 
                                              liberty of the individual may well 
                                              produce anarchy in such 
                                              circumstances. Offences may be
