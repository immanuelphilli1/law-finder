                                              The above glowing tributes 
                                              obviously provoke two intertwining 
                                              questions: First, what are the 
                                              contents of these two books, and 
                                              secondly, what are the central 
                                              messages sought to be conveyed by 
                                              the author? The Art of 
                                              Cross-Examination begins with an 
                                              Introduction which pleasantly 
                                              exposes the reader to one of the 
                                              fundamental objects of 
                                              cross-examination: to expose a 
                                              seemingly honourable, reliable and 
                                              over-confident witness as a liar 
                                              and an unreliable person whose 
                                              word is not worth the paper on 
                                              which it is written. To achieve 
                                              this, the author in one sentence 
                                              in the Introduction sums it all at 
                                              p 3:&nbsp; “Failure to know one’s case 
                                              well enough before cross-examining 
                                              could lead to the suppression of 
                                              truth and consequently to 
                                              undetected injustice.” The author 
                                              in chapters 1 and 2 suggests a 
                                              very practical way of knowing 
                                              one's case: preparation. The 
                                              subject is discussed under two 
                                              sub-headings—remote and immediate. 
                                              The author states what he means by 
                                              remote preparation thus at p 5:</span></p>

                                              the author advises the 
                                              cross-examiner to study the case 
                                              thoroughly; he must draw up a plan 
                                              of action but that must not

                                              questions. The author recommends a 
                                              more effective way: the 
                                              cross-examination must be built 
                                              around chosen topics or themes.</span></p>

                                              In chapter 3, the author deals 
                                              with the all important issue of 
                                              cross-examining a party to an 
                                              action: the plaintiff, the 
                                              defendant, the accused and their 
                                              counsel. The author admonishes 
                                              against the cross-examiner losing 
                                              his temper when cross-examining 
                                              the opposing party and he must not 
                                              initiate his cross-examination by 
                                              asking damaging questions. Rather 
                                              as stated at page 36, the 
                                              cross-examiner must start asking 
                                              seemingly innocuous questions and 
                                              “reserving the bomb-shell till a 
                                              time when it can only leave the 
                                              witness exasperated.” Chapters 4 
                                              and 5 deal with the biased and 
                                              unbiased witness. As to the way to 
                                              handle the handwriting expert, the 
                                              author impresses on the reader (at 
                                              p 85) the fact that there is no 
                                              magic about the handwriting expert 
                                              and that it could be shown by 
                                              cross-examination, that his 
                                              conclusions are in fact, 
                                              unscientific and based on half

                                              that heading, the author writes at 
                                              p 92, “My intention in writing 
                                              this book was to expose the 
                                              budding advocate to my own brand 
                                              of cross-examination.” It must be

                                              pp 92-93 the author makes some 
                                              observations “for the general

                                              unnecessary and purposeless 
                                              questions; he should not exhibit 
                                              overbearing attitude and shout at 
                                              the witness; he should 
                                              cross-examine on important 
                                              matters; the cross-examiner needs

                                              well-illustrated by civil and

                                              subject-matter, a defect which is

                                              Every author knows that writing 
                                              even an article, let alone a book, 
                                              is a time-consuming exercise. It 
                                              requires a lot of endurance, 
                                              patience and perseverance. Mr
