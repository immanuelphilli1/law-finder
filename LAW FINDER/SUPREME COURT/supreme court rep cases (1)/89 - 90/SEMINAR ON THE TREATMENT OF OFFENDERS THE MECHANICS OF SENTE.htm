                                              whatever view we take of the 
                                              laws—whether seeing them as 
                                              protecting a particular class of 
                                              people, that is the law makers or 
                                              as what God has ordained—they are 
                                              geared towards order in society 
                                              and the society is made up of 
                                              human beings. That being the case, 
                                              there are bound to be conformists 
                                              and non-conformists due to the one 
                                              great talent that the maker has 
                                              endowed the human being with, that 
                                              is, the ability to think for 
                                              himself.&nbsp; Some people say there is 
                                              the eleventh commandment, that is 
                                              &quot;Thou shall not be caught.&quot;&nbsp; It is 
                                              those who break this law who are 
                                              charged before the public 
                                              tribunals or what has become known 
                                              as the traditional courts which 
                                              are then called upon to decide 
                                              whether they are guilty or not. 
                                              Once found guilty, the tribunal or 
                                              court has the duty to impose the 
                                              appropriate punishment or sentence 
                                              as prescribed by law.</span></p>

                                              To justify conclusions on 
                                              sentences, it has always been the 
                                              usual practice to refer to the 
                                              causation of criminality like the 
                                              mental and physical constitution 
                                              of persons, their hereditary 
                                              tendencies, physical defects, 
                                              motives and character, 
                                              environmental conditions, moral 
                                              weakness and others like poverty 
                                              and unemployment. Indeed, an 
                                              Italian, Cesare Lombroso has 
                                              attributed causes of criminality 
                                              to hereditary tendencies and 
                                              physical defects like a heavy jaw, 
                                              a sloping forehead, scanty beard 
                                              and left handedness, while in 
                                              Ghana, it may even be attributed 
                                              to evil forces, especially an old 
                                              fair coloured aunt or grandmother. 
                                              In respect of juvenile 
                                              delinquencies, lack of proper 
                                              supervision and broken homes have 
                                              been identified as the major 
                                              causes. We must by all means not 
                                              forget the causation aspect in 
                                              deciding on the appropriate 
                                              sentence.</span></p>

                                              courts have a lot of discretion 
                                              except in a few cases like murder 
                                              for which there is no discretion 
                                              but to impose the death sentence. 
                                              This discretion must be exercised

                                              sentencing in Ghana have been 
                                              dictated by the theories of

                                              there is supposed to be some 
                                              necessary moral connection between 
                                              wrongdoing and punishment. 
                                              Retributive justice is a 
                                              refinement of the primitive urge 
                                              to take revenge for injury. 
                                              Philosophers have classified the 
                                              notion of retributive justice into 
                                              two propositions, negative and 
                                              positive. The negative side is 
                                              that people ought not to be 
                                              punished unless they have done a 
                                              wrong which must mean a moral 
                                              wrong. On the positive side is the 
                                              theory that wrongdoers ought to be 
                                              punished, either as a revenge or 
                                              vengeance.</span></p>

                                              Some philosophers believe the 
                                              whole of morality is concerned 
                                              with maximising human happiness or 
                                              welfare, looking to the future and 
                                              not to the past. Bentham, the 
                                              father of this theory, believes 
                                              that &quot;[A]ll punishment is 
                                              mischief.&nbsp; All punishment in 
                                              itself is evil. It ought to be 
                                              admitted in so far as it promises 
                                              to exclude some greater evil.&quot;&nbsp; 
                                              The reason for a sentence, 
                                              according to this theory, is 
                                              either its effect upon the person 
                                              punished or by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; serving as a 
                                              warning to others with like minded 
                                              tendencies as the convict. Thus 
                                              people are not sentenced to death 
                                              by shooting by firing squad for 
                                              armed robbery but that armed 
                                              robbery should not be committed. 
                                              This is the desire to use the 
                                              criminal trial by way of 
                                              denunciation, a means of 
                                              reinforcing society's feeling that 
                                              the conduct is bad.</span></p>

                                              The exponents of this theory of 
                                              punishment believe the whole 
                                              purpose of punishment should be to 
                                              reform a criminal. The advocates 
                                              of this theory believe that there 
                                              is the possibility of reforming a 
                                              criminal since they also believe 
                                              crime is the result of the social 
                                              inadequacies and that the human 
                                              being's character can be changed. 
                                              There is the proposition also that 
                                              the ultimate justification of any 
                                              punishment is not that it is 
                                              retributive of the particular 
                                              crime, thus the punishment must 
                                              fit the crime.</span></p>

                                              Mr Chairman, it is a difficult 
                                              task to sit in judgment over 
                                              others and it is a heavier burden 
                                              to sentence others.&nbsp; The 
                                              difficulty arises from the fact 
                                              that the sentencing authority is 
                                              often faced with the problem of 
                                              exercising a discretion on the 
                                              basis of the best choice from the 
                                              theories outlined above. 
                                              Experience has shown that most 
                                              officers faced with these problems 
                                              have opted out for the retributive 
                                              or deterrent theories. In his 
                                              book, Principles of Sentencing 
                                              (2nd ed), 35-37 D A Thomas states

                                              factors probably varies with the 
                                              type of offence and with the 
                                              opinion of the judge. Judges 
                                              however, are not good at 
                                              explaining their own motivations. 
                                              Sentencing is not an exact science 
                                              and great difference of approach

                                              therefore differs from one judge 
                                              or magistrate to the other.&nbsp; Apart

                                              sentencing may even depend on the

                                              power, his likes or dislikes.&nbsp; 
                                              There was a judicial officer who 
                                              was reputed to have used the dice 
                                              to determine the length of 
                                              imprisonment to be imposed on a 
                                              convict. There are other officers 
                                              who have a phobia for a particular 
                                              offence because of a past 
                                              experience.&nbsp; For example, a

                                              hates thieves. His sentence is,

                                              by any of the theories of 
                                              punishment outlined above. Some 
                                              officers too allow their sentences 
                                              to be determined by whether the 
                                              person pleads guilty or not. 
                                              Though this is unfortunate, it is

                                              ones who always want a short cut. 
                                              To them, a &quot;plea of not guilty&quot; is 
                                              a taboo and is immediately 
                                              followed by a remand in prison 
                                              custody for the accused to think. 
                                              If he pleads guilty, he is likely 
                                              to receive a more liberal sentence 
                                              than if he is convicted at the end 
                                              of a full trial. This practice

                                              by the Public Tribunals Law, 1982 
                                              (PNDCL 24). The latter enactment 
                                              was however repealed and replaced 
                                              by the Public Tribunals Law, 1984 
                                              (PNDCL 78). Permit me to digress a 
                                              little on the history of the 
                                              tribunals. The tribunals did not 
                                              come to be established in a 
                                              vacuum. They emerged through the 
                                              objective demands of the 
                                              revolutionary process. There was 
                                              the need to involve the ordinary 
                                              man, in the administration of 
                                              justice, there was the need to 
                                              demystify the administration of 
                                              justice and the need to strip it 
                                              of the artificial strappings of 
                                              the orthodox judiciary. Section 16 
                                              of the Public Tribunals Law, 1984 
                                              (PNDCL 78) is the provision that 
                                              deals with punishment or sentence. 
                                              It provides five types of 
                                              sentences, namely:</span></p>

                                              Again this country of course is 
                                              undergoing socio-economic 
                                              transformation. The country 
                                              therefore, needs peace to attract 
                                              investors and these investors are 
                                              only prepared to invest in a place 
                                              which they consider has the least 
                                              risk. At present, when the whole 
                                              world is waging a relentless war 
                                              against drug trafficking, Ghana 
                                              would appear ridiculous should our 
                                              sentencing policy deal leniently 
                                              with such offenders.&nbsp; Let us take 
                                              the case of our primary natural 
                                              resources.&nbsp; On timber fraud cases 
                                              for instance, it is to be noted 
                                              that researchers have discovered 
                                              African mahogany used in Europe is 
                                              logged in Ghana where the rain 
                                              forest is severely threatened. 
                                              According to Simon Rietbergen who 
                                              carried out his research in Ghana 
                                              for the International Tropical 
                                              Timber Organisation, 80 per cent 
                                              of the rain forest already 
                                              disappeared. In such a situation, 
                                              our sentencing policy should be 
                                              able to protect national interest 
                                              by executing such punishment on 
                                              those involved in the fraud so as 
                                              to serve as a deterrence to 
                                              others.&nbsp; The public tribunals in 
                                              such cases have mostly applied the 
                                              theory of deterrence as a 
                                              mechanism for sentencing convicts.

                                              The tribunals have sometimes used 
                                              the provisions of section 16(3) of 
                                              PNDCL 78 to let the punishment fit 
                                              the crime. Special circumstances 
                                              surrounding the accused such as 
                                              his background is taken into 
                                              consideration in considering 
                                              sentence. Thus if a businessman 
                                              who has ¢1 million to his credit 
                                              steals ¢5,000 from a poor civil 
                                              servant, he is not likely to 
                                              receive the same punishment as a

                                              man. The tribunals have also used 
                                              the same section to impose fines 
                                              and sentence convicts to do

                                              It does appear that both the 
                                              traditional courts and the 
                                              tribunals have tended to place 
                                              more emphasis on custodial 
                                              sentences than the other forms of 
                                              punishment like probation, fines, 
                                              bonds to be of good behaviour and 
                                              communal or manual labour. The 
                                              result is that our prisons now 
                                              contain many more inmates than 
                                              they were intended to, and the 
                                              prisons service is now calling 
                                              upon us to decongest them. For 
                                              example, at the last count, the 
                                              Sunyani prison had a total lock-up 
                                              population of 669 inmates whereas 
                                              the place was constructed for a 
                                              maximum of 400 people.&nbsp; It was 
                                              estimated that cl.4 million would 
                                              be needed for prisoners' uniform 
                                              and the feeding cost of its 
                                              inmates was put at el.8 million 
                                              per month. In the present system 
                                              however, a prisoner is expected to 
                                              serve one-third of his sentence 
                                              before he may be set to work, that 
                                              is if a person is sentenced to 30

                                              for ten years before he is allowed 
                                              to do any work outside, thus a lot 
                                              of manpower is lost.</span></p>

                                              last of such cases prosecuted not 
                                              because the practice ceased but it 
                                              is alleged that some operators 
                                              were prepared to pay any amounts 
                                              demanded to the security agencies 
                                              to avoid prosecution.&nbsp; When this 
                                              convict was released, he rode in 
                                              an open car dressed in all white 
                                              waving a white handkerchief 
                                              through the principal streets of 
                                              Cape Coast to a party held in his

                                              Our prisons have long ceased to be 
                                              places for reform.&nbsp; Instead, with 
                                              due apologies, they have been more 
                                              of a training ground for future 
                                              criminals. For example, in 
                                              September 1988, the Western 
                                              Regional Public Tribunal 
                                              convicted, Theophilus Boaman, a&nbsp; 
                                              prisons officer for attempting to 
                                              smuggle Indian hemp and akpeteshie 
                                              to inmates of the Sekondi Central 
                                              Prisons.&nbsp; How can such an officer 
                                              help to reform prisoners in this 
                                              custody? Sentencing policy must be 
                                              dynamic and respond to the 
                                              socio-economic demands of our 
                                              society.&nbsp; We must also remember 
                                              that whatever sentences we impose 
                                              today, how we use our discretion 
                                              may not be viewed in the same way 
                                              by the future generation as 
                                              society changes.&nbsp; The first known 
                                              recorded punishment is the one 
                                              imposed on the serpent, Adam and 
                                              Eve in Genesis 3 vrs: 14 to 19.&nbsp; 
                                              The story is well known but I am 
                                              sure some of us consider that 
                                              punishment today as being too 
                                              harsh on at least Adam and Eve on 
                                              the grounds that the temptation 
                                              they faced was too much for them.&nbsp; 
                                              Again, consider the fate of 
                                              Moses.&nbsp; In spite of his obedience 
                                              to Yahweh, in spite of all he went 
                                              through leading recalcitrant tribe 
                                              out of slavery, his punishment was 
                                              &quot;you will see Canaan but your legs 
                                              shall not step there&quot; for failure 
                                              to control his temper.&nbsp; How many 
                                              of us today will impose the same 
                                              sentence more so when the people 
                                              who provoked Moses to anger 
                                              entered Canaan?&nbsp; I have already 
                                              said our sentencing policy must 
                                              reflect our efforts in social and 
                                              economic development.&nbsp; Society is 
                                              changing and there is the need to 
                                              have look at our sentencing policy 
                                              to determine whether they meet the 
                                              end of justice.&nbsp; By and large, 
                                              most of our convicts are those hit 
                                              by the antithesis within the 
                                              society, that is to say, the 
                                              product of an unequal, corrupt and 
                                              careless socio-economic and 
                                              political system; the victims of 
                                              the unjust order.&nbsp; And it is this 
                                              group of convicts who need 
                                              reformation.&nbsp; And in reforming 
                                              them, we must not make them 
                                              paupers and thus create more 
                                              social problems.&nbsp; The devil, they 
                                              say, finds work for idle hands.</span></p>

                                              In sentencing therefore, we must 
                                              make sure that we do not expose 
                                              them unnecessarily to the hardened 
                                              criminal in our prisons. Instead, 
                                              a way ought to be found to train 
                                              them to become useful citizens in 
                                              the future.&nbsp; This goes for 
                                              relatively minor offences and it 
                                              is for such offences that 
                                              increasing use must be made of 
                                              section 16(4) of PNDCL 78 to make 
                                              convicts subject to manual or 
                                              communal labour. In the process, 
                                              the convict himself learns a 
                                              profession while he pays his debt 
                                              to society by contributing towards 
                                              its development.</span></p>
