                                              Rudyard Kipling, the great English 
                                              poet, whose mortal remains now lie 
                                              in Westminster Abbey, London, 
                                              wrote a poem “lest we forget.” 
                                              This poem found its way into the 
                                              Methodist Hymn Book as No. 889. In

                                              reminded his fellow Englishmen and 
                                              women of some facts of history 
                                              they should always learn to

                                              this day and age, the duty of

                                              responsibilities is done sometimes

                                              Another example is “slow down”

                                              Day. The son saw an inscription on

                                              Many of our people think like the

                                              belief that if a lawyer dies, he 
                                              is put into the coffin face 
                                              downwards so that he cannot look 
                                              at his maker in the face. I held 
                                              this view until as national

                                              This erroneous view about lawyers 
                                              is from time to time watered by 
                                              virulent attacks on them by a

                                              individuals. An interesting one 
                                              was by Sergeant Alolga Akatapore, 
                                              published in the West African 
                                              magazine in an interview when the 
                                              sergeant, then a member of PNDC 
                                              was returning from Moscow, USSR. 
                                              He said: &quot;All lawyers are rogues 
                                              and thieves except a few ones.” I 
                                              do not know whether the sergeant 
                                              was quoting from the Talmud where 
                                              lawyers are referred to as 
                                              &quot;oppressors and robbers.&quot; In view

                                              facts lest we forget. Are lawyers 
                                              in fact nothing but 
                                              obstructionists or the bad people

                                              This compartmentalisation of the 
                                              life and works of Sarbah was 
                                              adopted by the Honourable Mr Kojo

                                              Sarbah. I believe I am in good 
                                              company if I look at Sarbah's life 
                                              and work through the same 
                                              spectacles. The first remark I 
                                              would like to make is that Sarbah 
                                              saw the acquisition of knowledge 
                                              of law not as an end in itself but 
                                              as a means to an end, ie service 
                                              to mankind in whatever situation 
                                              he found himself.</span></p>

                                              close down the school. He re-named 
                                              the school &quot;Mfantsipim&quot; and 
                                              designed the school's motto &quot;Dwen

                                              into financial difficulties he 
                                              assisted by paying the salaries of 
                                              the staff from his own pocket. He 
                                              bought a pipe organ for the 
                                              Wesleyan Church in Cape Coast in

                                              cases the statement of law was 
                                              adopted, in others it is said to 
                                              be too wide a proposition. Later 
                                              textwriters like Danquah, Ollennu, 
                                              Bentsi-Enchill and also Kludze 
                                              have all used it as a primary 
                                              source material. No writer on our 
                                              customary law can do without 
                                              Sarbah's Fanti Customary Law as a 
                                              starting point of his thesis and 
                                              this will be so for a long time to 
                                              come. With the efluxion of nearly 
                                              a century, we may not now agree 
                                              with everything Sarbah wrote and 
                                              this is what it must be.</span></p>

                                              1897 led to his formation of the

                                              Sarbah was the first native of the 
                                              Gold Coast to be enrolled as a 
                                              barrister, others before him, like

                                              solicitors. Sarbah served his

                                              country and his church. No one was

                                              From Sarbah and Casely Hayford one 
                                              must naturally go to Peter Awoonor 
                                              Renner, the author of Renner’s Law 
                                              Reports, a work which enjoyed 
                                              great prestige but less known and 
                                              used today. When municipal council 
                                              elections were introduced, lawyers 
                                              were the leaders of the 
                                              Ratepayers' Party and Maambii 
                                              Party. One remembers with delight 
                                              names like Hutton Mills, Frans 
                                              Dove, Kobina Sekyi, Kojo Thompson 
                                              and Dr J B Danquah who were all 
                                              active participants in the 
                                              politics of their time.</span></p>

                                              It is therefore not surprising 
                                              that in Busia's parliament there 
                                              were 35 lawyers out of 140 MPs and 
                                              in Limann's there were 28 out of 
                                              140 MPs. As a professional group 
                                              lawyers in the past dominated the 
                                              politics of this country. Not 
                                              because lawyers were power hungry 
                                              or because they had arrogated to 
                                              themselves the divine right to 
                                              rule, as is being alleged these 
                                              days in certain circles. Lawyers 
                                              are trained to defend the rights 
                                              and liberties of the individual. 
                                              As long as there continue to be 
                                              lawyers in this country any 
                                              attempt to trample upon the rights 
                                              and liberties of the people will 
                                              find them in opposition. This is 
                                              so, not only in Ghana but also in 
                                              other parts of the world. In other 
                                              spheres of human endeavour the 
                                              presence of lawyers is very much 
                                              felt even in the church. This 
                                              reminds me of Dr J B Danquah in 
                                              whose memory the Ghana Academy of 
                                              Arts and Sciences has instituted 
                                              an annual lecture.</span></p>

                                              of human rights. The judgments of

                                              as far back as 1758; and In re

                                              Please, permit me to tell you of 
                                              an incident. Barely three months 
                                              after my enrolment, I&nbsp; found 
                                              myself appearing against Dr 
                                              Danquah in a land appeal case 
                                              before Mr Justice Ollennu. Mr 
                                              Ollennu called Mr Elegba, the 
                                              stenographer and dictated his 
                                              judgment. I&nbsp; lost. In the 
                                              afternoon when I came to chambers, 
                                              Mr Bentsi-Enchill called me and 
                                              told me that Dr Danquah had 
                                              telephoned him to tell him that 
                                              even though I lost the appeal my 
                                              performance was very good indeed 
                                              and that I should keep it up. Few 
                                              are the seniors who would 
                                              congratulate a junior when they 
                                              are the winners and the junior, 
                                              the loser. Such was Dr Danquah 
                                              that he gave honour where honour 
                                              was due.</span></p>

                                              court clerks and letter writers 
                                              who collect the bulk of the fees 
                                              and give the lawyers ¢1,000 per 
                                              motion and he accepts it. As if 
                                              this is not bad enough, when the 
                                              judge asks a question, the lawyer 
                                              begins to look for the client whom 
                                              he sees for the first time, or the 
                                              lawyer quickly goes to consult the 
                                              letter writer. Thank God, not many 
                                              lawyers engage in this practice 
                                              but I think the honour and 
                                              integrity of the profession should 
                                              be maintained. I am not advocating 
                                              monopoly but if court clerks and 
                                              letter writers know how to prepare 
                                              letters of administration, then by 
                                              all means they must move the 
                                              application in court.</span></p>

                                              lawyers in private practice should

                                              in private practice. Failure to 
                                              attend a minimum number of times 
                                              should attract a sanction to be 
                                              imposed by the Bar Association. To 
                                              this end, I further suggest that

                                              and Faculty should be revived. 
                                              This used to be an annual affair 
                                              held early in the legal vacation 
                                              at Legon. Compulsory continuing 
                                              education for practitioners is a 
                                              sure way of improving the services
