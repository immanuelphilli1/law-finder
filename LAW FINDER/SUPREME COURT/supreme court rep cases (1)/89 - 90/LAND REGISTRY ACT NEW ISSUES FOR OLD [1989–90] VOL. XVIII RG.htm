                                              THE volume of litigation turning 
                                              on the Land Registry Act, 1962 
                                              (Act 122) evidences the statute’s 
                                              practical importance.&nbsp; It also 
                                              demonstrates the difficulty of 
                                              establishing regular, full 
                                              compliance with the procedures 
                                              necessary for its efficient

                                              parties affected by it.&nbsp; This note 
                                              discusses the issues raised in two 
                                              recent cases where the application 
                                              of the Act was accompanied by 
                                              doubts and controversy.&nbsp; The joint 
                                              outcome of the cases was to 
                                              resolve one long standing issue, 
                                              to develop the law on others, and 
                                              to reveal troubling possibilities 
                                              of problems in certain new issues.</span></p>

                                              In Odametey v Clocuh1 a written 
                                              conveyance had been made on behalf 
                                              of the Akumajay stool of Accra in 
                                              favour of the plaintiff in 1970.&nbsp; 
                                              She had presented it for 
                                              registration in the same year.&nbsp; It 
                                              had still not been registered by 
                                              1976, when a representative of the 
                                              stool made a written conveyance of 
                                              the same land in favour of VB, who 
                                              secured registration of this 
                                              instrument. Still in 1976, VB then 
                                              made a written conveyance in 
                                              favour of the second defendant, 
                                              who registered that instrument 
                                              also.&nbsp; As a result of events on 
                                              the land the plaintiff sued for a 
                                              declaration of title, damages for 
                                              trespass and an injunction.&nbsp; The 
                                              second defendant in his defence 
                                              claimed title.&nbsp; He asserted that 
                                              the plaintiff’s title was 
                                              ineffective, relying on the Land 
                                              Registry Act, 1962 (Act 122), s 
                                              24(1), which, as far as is 
                                              relevant here, provides that “an 
                                              instrument ... shall be of no 
                                              effect until it is registered.”</span></p>

                                              registration.&nbsp; According to this, 
                                              if an instrument had been duly 
                                              presented for registration, and

                                              register it, in equity it would

                                              it was presented.&nbsp; The Supreme 
                                              Court held by a majority that the 
                                              doctrine was not part of the law, 
                                              and gave judgment for the

                                              arguments, but merely to comment 
                                              briefly on this latest (and 
                                              possibly terminal) stage of the 
                                              judicial debate on the issue.</span></p>

                                              Taylor JSC noted that the doctrine 
                                              was first propounded in Ntem v 
                                              Ankwandah3 by Apaloo CJ in a 
                                              judgment concurred in by the other 
                                              members of the Court of Appeal.&nbsp; 
                                              Taylor JSC argued first that this 
                                              holding was contrary to three 
                                              decisions of the Court of Appeal 
                                              which should have been recognised 
                                              as binding upon the court.4&nbsp; 
                                              Secondly, he contended that it was 
                                              contrary to the words of section 
                                              24(1).&nbsp; In a discourse on the 
                                              judicial use of the words “void,” 
                                              “ineffective” and “invalid,” 
                                              Taylor JSC argued: [The simple use 
                                              of these words does not really 
                                              make any difference whatsoever in 
                                              all cases where at the end of a 
                                              trial the conveyance in dispute 
                                              remained unregistered.”&nbsp; Finally, 
                                              Taylor JSC noted that subsequent 
                                              decisions had weakened the 
                                              authority supporting the 
                                              doctrine.&nbsp; It had been rejected by 
                                              the Supreme Court in Nartey v 
                                              Mechanical Lloyd Assembly Plant 
                                              Ltd, reversing a decision of the 
                                              Court of Appeal which had adopted 
                                              the doctrine.5&nbsp; This may not have 
                                              been the strongest of authority, 
                                              since the majority of the Supreme 
                                              Court held there that the 
                                              unregistered instrument had been 
                                              made by a grantor who was not 
                                              entitled to make the grant: thus 
                                              even if it had been deemed to have 
                                              been registered it would have been 
                                              ineffective, and therefore a 
                                              decision on the doctrine of 
                                              constructive registration was not 
                                              vital. However, Taylor JSC had 
                                              emphatically stated in that case 
                                              that an unregistered conveyance 
                                              was “ineffective and invalid to 
                                              confer rights and impose 
                                              obligations.”6 Furthermore, in 
                                              Ayitey v Mantey,7&nbsp; Francois JA (as 
                                              he then was), a member of the 
                                              court which had decided Ntem v 
                                              Ankwandah, had confessed to “a 
                                              lack of confidence in the 
                                              correctness of the decision.”</span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

                                              The Supreme Court was not 
                                              unanimous on this issue.&nbsp; 
                                              Amua-Sekyi JSC stated that he 
                                              “fully supported” the decision in 
                                              Ntem v Ankwandah.&nbsp; However, he 
                                              considered it inapplicable in the 
                                              present case because the 
                                              instrument had in fact been 
                                              registered before the conclusion 
                                              of the trial.&nbsp; The implication of 
                                              this development (which will be 
                                              reverted to below) was in turn 
                                              undermined by the view of 
                                              Amua-Sekyi JSC that the grantor 
                                              had ceased to hold title to the 
                                              land before 1970.&nbsp; Hence he 
                                              ultimately reached the same 
                                              decision as Taylor JSC, although 
                                              for quite different reasons.&nbsp; 
                                              Francois and Wuaku JJSC stated 
                                              that they agreed with the judgment 
                                              of Taylor JSC, the former thus 
                                              impliedly repeating his earlier 
                                              repudiation of the doctrine.&nbsp; The 
                                              judgment of Adade JSC, which 
                                              followed immediately that of 
                                              Taylor JSC, reads in full: “I 
                                              agree only in the general 
                                              conclusion that the appeal fails 
                                              and ought to be dismissed.”&nbsp; Adade 
                                              JSC seems in these words to 
                                              distance himself from the 
                                              particular arguments and holdings 
                                              of Taylor JSC. But the reasons for 
                                              his concurrence in the decision 
                                              are unstated.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is 
                                              clear that the particular 
                                              arguments of Taylor JSC were 
                                              accepted by a majority of the 
                                              Supreme Court. Ntem v Ankwandah 
                                              may not be quite dead, but it 
                                              seems unlikely to be restored to 
                                              vigour.</span></p>

                                              alleged customary law grantors to 
                                              act on behalf of the stool was 
                                              questionable. Consequently, the 
                                              judgment of Taylor JSC was 
                                              directed exclusively to the 
                                              question of the effectiveness of 
                                              the documentary conveyances, with 
                                              the result already noted.&nbsp; 
                                              Amua-Sekyi JSC held that the 
                                              customary law grant of 1960 to the 
                                              second defendant’s vendor had been 
                                              valid. Consequently, the customary 
                                              law grant of 1962 to the plaintiff 
                                              and the documentary grant to her 
                                              of 1970, even assuming that it had 
                                              been validated by constructive 
                                              registration, had been 
                                              ineffective, because the grantors 
                                              had no longer held title at the 
                                              times they were made. The view of 
                                              Taylor JSC was the view of the 
                                              majority.</span></p>

                                              Consideration of the course of 
                                              events, including the course of 
                                              the case, prompts the suggestion 
                                              of certain propositions: (1) A 
                                              customary law grant, if validly 
                                              made by a legally competent party, 
                                              transfers a good title without 
                                              writing.(2) After such a grant, no 
                                              grantor may validly transfer, 
                                              whether by a customary law grant 
                                              or by a common law documentary 
                                              conveyance, any of the rights 
                                              which have been transferred to the 
                                              grantee under that first customary 
                                              law grant. (3) If a grantor makes 
                                              a common law documentary 
                                              conveyance in favour of a party 
                                              who has already received a grant 
                                              under customary law, then (i) in 
                                              so far as the instrument purports 
                                              to transfer rights already passed 
                                              by the customary law grant, it is 
                                              ineffective, although it would 
                                              seem that it may be construed as a 
                                              written confirmation of that 
                                              grant; but (ii) in so far as it 
                                              purports to transfer any rights 
                                              previously retained by the 
                                              grantor, for example by granting a 
                                              more extensive interest than the 
                                              prior grant, it is effective. (4) 
                                              If a titleholder makes a common 
                                              law documentary conveyance in 
                                              respect of land which has 
                                              previously been the subject of an 
                                              invalid customary law grant, but 
                                              not of a valid grant, then the 
                                              documentary conveyance is 
                                              effective.&nbsp; In the present case, 
                                              Amua-Sekyi JSC considered that the 
                                              issue fell to be decided by 
                                              propositions (1) and (2).&nbsp; Taylor 
                                              JSC, because he held that the 
                                              parties were bound to rely only on 
                                              their documentary conveyances, 
                                              considered it a matter of 
                                              proposition (4), the primary issue 
                                              being that of priority between two

                                              It confers an additional 
                                              advantage, since section 25(1) of 
                                              the Act provides that 
                                              “registration of any instrument

                                              constructing one of the grounds of 
                                              decision in Nartey v Mechanical 
                                              Lloyd Assembly Plant Ltd.&nbsp; In that 
                                              case the plaintiff claimed title 
                                              by a documentary grant from the 
                                              representative of the Agbawe 
                                              family of La.&nbsp; The 
                                              defendant-company argued that this 
                                              grant was ineffective, because 
                                              only the La stool was competent to 
                                              grant land in the area where the 
                                              land in issue was situate.&nbsp; The 
                                              plaintiff’s instrument had been 
                                              registered.&nbsp; So had many other 
                                              grants of land in the vicinity 
                                              made by the Agbawe family.&nbsp; Taylor 
                                              JSC held on the basis of section 
                                              25(1) that these registrations 
                                              must be deemed to have given the 
                                              La stool notice of the fact that 
                                              the Agbawe family was persistently 
                                              asserting the right to make grants 
                                              of land in this area. This served 
                                              to establish one of the elements 
                                              of acquiescence which, Taylor JSC 
                                              held, estopped the stool and 
                                              those, like the defendant-company, 
                                              who claimed through the stool.8</span></p>

                                              This suggests that the effects of 
                                              section 25(1) could be 
                                              far-reaching:&nbsp; Its obvious and 
                                              unproblematic application occurs 
                                              where there is a grant of land 
                                              which has already been the subject 
                                              of a registered grant.&nbsp; Any 
                                              prospective purchaser may be 
                                              expected, as part of the usual 
                                              investigation of title, to conduct 
                                              a search at the Land Registry.&nbsp; 
                                              Today the registry plots the 
                                              subject-matter of every registered 
                                              instrument on a map of the area. 
                                              Thus it is simple in practice to 
                                              discover all the registered 
                                              instruments relating to a 
                                              particular portion of land.&nbsp; A 
                                              purchaser can hardly complain of 
                                              being deemed to take with notice 
                                              of any such prior registered 
                                              grant.&nbsp; In the present case, this 
                                              was the position of the 
                                              defendant-company.&nbsp; But to hold

                                              purporting to grant it away.&nbsp; This 
                                              conclusion follows from the

                                              general proposition. The holder of 
                                              an unregistered instrument will be 
                                              protected by the court by the 
                                              enforcement of his right to 
                                              register it (provided it is not an 
                                              instrument which may be lawfully 
                                              refused registration).11 But the 
                                              argument does not show that the 
                                              particular actions of the Land 
                                              Registry officers in this case 
                                              were lawful and effective.</span></p>

                                              enactment, the parties to the

                                              referred.&nbsp; But it would appear to

                                              The Act provides no means of 
                                              cancelling a registration once it 
                                              has been effected.&nbsp; No doubt a 
                                              court might declare that a 
                                              purported registration was void, 
                                              if for example, it had been 
                                              procured by fraud in the 
                                              registration process. But the 
                                              absence of any extensive 
                                              possibility of refusing 
                                              registration, and of any statutory 
                                              provision for cancellation, is 
                                              accounted for by the absence of 
                                              any possibility for registration 
                                              to remedy a defect in an 
                                              instrument. Registration has two 
                                              effects:&nbsp; It terminates the 
                                              operation of section 24, which 
                                              prior to registration has deprived 
                                              the instrument of any effect which 
                                              it would otherwise have had. It 
                                              constitutes actual notice.&nbsp; 
                                              Neither of these consequences 
                                              entails the validation of an 
                                              otherwise invalid instrument. An 
                                              invalid instrument may have to be 
                                              registered if presented, and 
                                              cannot be “de-registered.” But 
                                              this is immaterial because it 
                                              continues to be invalid.</span></p>

                                              “Plotting” on the other hand 
                                              appears to be a purely 
                                              administrative procedure 
                                              introduced by the Lands

                                              in the Land Registry it would seem 
                                              to be a valuable initiative, for 
                                              which land purchasers and users 
                                              must be grateful. But nothing in 
                                              the Act supports the conclusion 
                                              that the procedure affects the 
                                              legal status of an instrument.&nbsp; 
                                              There is no ground for holding 
                                              that legal consequences follow 
                                              from the “plotting,” refusal of

                                              instrument or the land which it 
                                              affects.</span></p>

                                              While the Land Registry may not 
                                              have at law the power to affect 
                                              instruments by plotting, it may

                                              of Amua-Sekyi JSC in Odametey v 
                                              Clocuh. It has been mentioned that 
                                              the plaintiff’s instrument was 
                                              presented for registration in 
                                              1970, but wrongly not registered, 
                                              while the two instruments on which 
                                              the second defendant's title was 
                                              based, executed in 1976, were 
                                              registered in that year. 
                                              Amua-Sekyi JSC would have been 
                                              prepared to apply the doctrine of 
                                              constructive registration in 
                                              favour of the plaintiff. But he 
                                              found this unnecessary because, by 
                                              the end of the trial, the 
                                              plaintiff’s instrument was no 
                                              longer in the category of those 
                                              affected by the doctrine, that is, 
                                              instruments presented for 
                                              registration but wrongly not 
                                              registered.&nbsp; Apparently the 
                                              plaintiff’s instrument was 
                                              eventually registered during the 
                                              course of the trial.&nbsp; It might 
                                              have been imagined that this was 
                                              too late to affect the priorities. 
                                              However, section 26(2) of the Act 
                                              (the “period of grace” provisions) 
                                              enacts that, if an instrument is 
                                              presented for registration within 
                                              a specified period from its 
                                              execution, it is to take effect as 
                                              against other instruments from the 
                                              date of its execution, not from 
                                              the date of its registration. 
                                              Amua-Sekyi JSC held: “[P]rovided 
                                              section 26(2) was complied with 
                                              (and this may fairly be assumed in 
                                              favour of the plaintiff) [the 
                                              plaintiff’s instrument] took 
                                              effect from the date of its 
                                              execution, that is, in 1970.” The 
                                              implication is that, if the Land 
                                              Registry wrongly fails to register 
                                              an instrument which is presented 
                                              promptly after its execution, the 
                                              Registry retains the power to 
                                              register it at a much later date, 
                                              with retrospective effect, so that 
                                              it gains priority over other 
                                              instruments which were registered 
                                              years earlier.</span></p>

                                              This may provide an opportunity to 
                                              remedy the wrong done to those

                                              the Act has never been fully

                                              above, note 4, which he held in 
                                              the present case to have been 
                                              wrongly disregarded by the Court 
                                              of Appeal in Ntem v Akwandah.&nbsp; He 
                                              added that the Court of Appeal had 
                                              on this ground acted in 
                                              contravention of the Land Registry 
                                              Act, 1962, in admitting the 
                                              unregistered document in evidence. 
                                              With respect, it is questionable 
                                              whether the words of section 24(1) 
                                              are sufficient to sustain this 
                                              view. They provide that an 
                                              unregistered document cannot be 
                                              regarded as having had any 
                                              “effect”in transferring rights in 
                                              land; they do not state that it 
                                              cannot even be considered as 
                                              evidence for what it is worth, of 
                                              facts which are relevant in a
