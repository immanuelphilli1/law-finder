                                              There appears to be a consensus 
                                              amongst academics, government 
                                              advisory bodies and legislators 
                                              that high levels of incarceration 
                                              are ineffective and inhumane and 
                                              that disenchantment with 
                                              institutional penal programmes

                                              of any prison system is as much a 
                                              direct cost to society as crime 
                                              itself.&nbsp; The cost of imprisonment 
                                              may also be measured in terms of 
                                              its damaging social, psychological 
                                              and interpersonal correlates. This

                                              understand the PNDC’s serious 
                                              concern about our prison condition 
                                              and the efforts which are being

                                              that our penal policy attaches 
                                              some importance to community based 
                                              corrections.&nbsp; This is because they 
                                              offer the humanitarian advantage

                                              imprisonment and large fiscal 
                                              savings.&nbsp; A certain number of our 
                                              offenders may instead be retained 
                                              in the community as safely, as 
                                              effectively and at much less 
                                              expense to the taxpayer.&nbsp; Such

                                              sentenced to six years' 
                                              imprisonment is entitled to good

                                              able to earn parole. He could then

                                              years of his sentence. His next 
                                              two years are spent on licence 
                                              under supervision (by a probation 
                                              officer) and his last two years at

                                              recall. For a person serving a 
                                              six-month sentence, parole is 
                                              irrelevant. With a nine-month 
                                              sentence, the character becomes 
                                              eligible after serving six months 
                                              and can also be automatically

                                              There are three stages in parole 
                                              decision-making. The first stage 
                                              involves the local review 
                                              committee. This is the first 
                                              formal stage in the process of 
                                              selection for parole. The 
                                              committee is made up of (i) the 
                                              Officer-in-Charge of the prison, 
                                              (ii) a member of the Board of 
                                              Visitors, (iii) a probation 
                                              officer, and (iv) an independent 
                                              member (with no connection 
                                              whatsoever with the judiciary or 
                                              law enforcement agencies). The 
                                              task of the committee is to review 
                                              each eligible inmate who wishes to 
                                              be considered for release on 
                                              licence, and to recommend to the 
                                              Secretary of State (Secretary for 
                                              the Interior in the case of Ghana) 
                                              if they consider him/her to be 
                                              suitable or unsuitable. The second 
                                              stage concerns the parole board. 
                                              The board is appointed by and is 
                                              responsible to the Home Secretary.

                                              release on licence and recall of

                                              with release on licence or recall

                                              means of classifying offenders 
                                              into risk groups by examining to

                                              Criminologists use prediction 
                                              scores for two main purposes. The 
                                              first is to identify those people 
                                              most at risk of committing or 
                                              continuing to commit offences, and 
                                              the second is to assess the 
                                              effectiveness of penal treatment. 
                                              In the latter case, prediction 
                                              scores, arrived at by classifying 
                                              offenders according to their risk 
                                              of committing offences on the 
                                              basis of information known about 
                                              them before they are allocated to 
                                              a particular treatment, provide a 
                                              base-line against which their 
                                              reconvictions after treatment can 
                                              be assessed. The main variables 
                                              normally taken into account during

                                              There is some evidence that 
                                              incarceration, certainly if it is 
                                              prolonged, may well have an 
                                              adverse effect upon criminal 
                                              behaviour and actually promotes 
                                              lawlessness. The thesis that 
                                              imprisonment itself is 
                                              criminogenic dates back at least 
                                              to the time of John Howard, who 
                                              called prisons &quot;seats and 
                                              seminaries of every idleness and 
                                              vice&quot; and of Jeremy Bentham, who 
                                              suggested that &quot;an ordinary prison 
                                              is a school in which wickedness is 
                                              taught by surer means or can ever 
                                              be employed for the inculcation of 
                                              virtue&quot; (Bentham, 1864, p. 351). 
                                              In more recent years, this view 
                                              has been taken up by (Clemmer 
                                              1940, pp 299-316) who suggests 
                                              that, through a process of &quot;prisonisation&quot; 
                                              a prisoner tends to become 
                                              assimilated into the culture of 
                                              the penitentiary and thereby 
                                              subject to influences which would 
                                              deepen his criminality and 
                                              progressively unfit him for 
                                              re-entry into civil life. And, 
                                              although the implied causal 
                                              relationship between exposure to 
                                              prison and increased criminality 
                                              has been questioned (Hawkins, 
                                              1976, chap 3), there is some 
                                              evidence that longer prison 
                                              sentences are positively 
                                              associated with an increased 
                                              probability of reconviction (Eichman, 
                                              1966, Juman and Dickover, 1969). 
                                              The most impressive comes from 
                                              Florida where following the United 
                                              States Supreme Court's decision in 
                                              Gideon v Wainwright, as many as 
                                              1,252 convicted and imprisoned 
                                              offenders had to be released 
                                              because it was judged they had 
                                              been improperly convicted without 
                                              a counsel. This permitted a 
                                              comparison to be made between the 
                                              early releases and a matched group 
                                              of prisoners released at the same 
                                              time but at the end of their 
                                              sentences. The early release - 
                                              prisoners showed a significantly 
                                              lower recidivism rate of 13.6 per 
                                              cent. Compared with the controls' 
                                              reconviction rate of 25.4 per 
                                              cent. (Eichman, 1966). In 
                                              addition, there is now an 
                                              overwhelming research consensus 
                                              that prisons, like all other penal 
                                              strategies, have negligible 
                                              behavioural impact. For example, 
                                              early British views of the 
                                              effectiveness of penal treatment 
                                              talked about the &quot;interchangeability 
                                              of penal measures.&quot; (Walker, 1965, 
                                              pp 257-259, 1971, pp 120-122) and 
                                              consistently negative research 
                                              findings (Hood and Sparks, 1970, 
                                              chaps 6 and 7).</span></p>

                                              then that prisons simply do not 
                                              work as instruments for reforming 
                                              criminal behaviour. The 
                                              ineffectiveness of penal treatment 
                                              has opened up a great void in 
                                              penal philosophy, and in practical 
                                              terms the lack of authoritative

                                              the continued use of imprisonment

                                              The worst feature of our penal 
                                              system is overcrowding. The impact 
                                              of overcrowding is not limited to 
                                              living quarters. Rather it has a 
                                              &quot;knock-on&quot; effect throughout the 
                                              prisons and affects workshops, 
                                              recreation, visiting and 
                                              educational facilities. In such a 
                                              situation, the fulfilment of the 
                                              aim of the prisons service to help 
                                              prisoners lead &quot;a good and useful 
                                              life&quot; becomes even more remote.&nbsp; 
                                              The prison population is a little 
                                              over ten thousand as at now. This 
                                              figure does not mean that there is 
                                              an alarming rate of growth of 
                                              crime in this country. It is 
                                              simply a case where certain 
                                              offences which should not attracts 
                                              a prison sentence do so. Prison 
                                              statistics show that the major 
                                              offence which attract sentence of 
                                              imprisonment is stealing. A little 
                                              over two-thirds of all prison 
                                              inmates are convicted on stealing 
                                              charges. This group of offenders 
                                              are followed by persons convicted 
                                              of &quot;economic sabotage&quot; offences. 
                                              This, accounts for about 6.0 per 
                                              cent of inmates. The third 
                                              category consists of inmates 
                                              convicted for &quot;unlawful entry&quot; an 
                                              average of 4.50 per cent; then 
                                              inmates convicted on &quot;conspiracy 
                                              to commit crime&quot; 4.30 per cent. 
                                              Offenders convicted of assault 
                                              constitute approximately 3.50 per 
                                              cent, &quot;other offences” and 
                                              &quot;causing harm&quot; represent about 3.0 
                                              per cent respectively. Persons 
                                              convicted on robbery charges 
                                              account for 2.0 per cent. Fraud 
                                              3.0 per cent. Murder, drugs and 
                                              debts 1.3 per cent. These 
                                              statistics tend to reflect the 
                                              attitude of the courts towards 
                                              certain type of offences. The 
                                              statistics also show that, except 
                                              for a few murderers, armed robbers 
                                              and economic saboteurs, we cannot 
                                              really talk of the so-called 
                                              dangerous offenders in our prisons 
                                              as in other countries.</span></p>

                                              Attempts to reduce the prison 
                                              population have included efforts 
                                              to take people out of the prisons 
                                              as well as schemes to decongest 
                                              the prisons. Examples of the 
                                              former include the introduction of 
                                              remission, government amnesty and 
                                              pardon and the latter, the opening

                                              are not enough. The introduction 
                                              of the parole system will benefit 
                                              both the prisoner and the society. 
                                              Under the parole system a good 
                                              number of our prison inmates will 
                                              be flushed out from the system, 
                                              thus reducing overcrowding, 
                                              maintenance and generally 
                                              improving conditions in the 
                                              system. It is estimated that 
                                              between two and three thousand 
                                              inmates can be paroled yearly, a 
                                              great relief to the Prisons
