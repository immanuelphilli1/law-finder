                                              I ought on this occasion to be 
                                              able to share my thoughts with you 
                                              and give you a detailed assessment 
                                              of what I think our performance as 
                                              a ministry has been within the 
                                              past one year, and to make 
                                              suggestions where necessary as to 
                                              how to improve our performance. 
                                              Unfortunately I have been away on 
                                              assignments of state, and 
                                              therefore unavailable to be 
                                              informed adequately in advance to 
                                              enable me put on paper all that I 
                                              would have liked us to table for 
                                              discussion on an occasion such as 
                                              this. Secondly, since I am 
                                              required to give a short address I 
                                              have to sacrifice detail for 
                                              precision. These two constraints 
                                              are, of course, not easy for 
                                              anybody to handle.</span></p>

                                              If I appear to put emphasis on the 
                                              Regions in respect of the problems 
                                              we face, that is not to 
                                              underestimate the magnitude of the 
                                              plight of the head office but to 
                                              accept the fact that the Regions 
                                              constitute the larger unit of the 
                                              ministry and handle cases 
                                              affecting seventy-five per cent of 
                                              our country's population that 
                                              lives in the rural areas. These 
                                              are places that are mostly 
                                              sparsely populated and where 
                                              distances from one place or court 
                                              to another pose considerable 
                                              difficulty. I do not intend to 
                                              tell you of the efforts we have 
                                              made to resolve most of these 
                                              problems that have been with us 
                                              for over a decade. I believe the 
                                              Acting Attorney-General has 
                                              sufficiently dealt with our 
                                              efforts in these directions or 
                                              will deal with them during the 
                                              course of this durbar, probably 
                                              with my assistance, where 
                                              necessary. I should like to say 
                                              that these problems in the public 
                                              service were due to the sad state 
                                              of the nation's economy and have 
                                              been inherited by the PNDC. As the 
                                              economy has begun to show 
                                              indications of growth, these 
                                              problems are gradually being 
                                              resolved as we can all testify to 
                                              by looking at various sectors of 
                                              the public service. The question 
                                              which I believe most of you would 
                                              like to ask me, even before I 
                                              proceed, is why the Ministry of 
                                              Justice has not yet had as much as 
                                              the other ministries? The answer 
                                              that comes to mind immediately is 
                                              that we are in the queue and it is 
                                              almost our turn to reap the 
                                              benefit of economic recovery.</span></p>

                                              The role of the lawyer in the 
                                              economic recovery effort of any 
                                              nation cannot be over-emphasised. 
                                              An economy must develop within a 
                                              regime of law. The role, 
                                              particularly of an attorney who is 
                                              a lawyer in practice in the full 
                                              time employ of the government as 
                                              its counsel is paramount for the 
                                              fulfilment of the set objectives 
                                              of government, to improve the 
                                              economy and thereby the material 
                                              well-being of the people of the 
                                              nation. The law is not simply an 
                                              impartial set of rules and 
                                              regulations for the ordering of 
                                              the conduct of society. One should 
                                              be very skeptical of the efficacy 
                                              of any “rule of recognition,” &quot;grundnom&quot; 
                                              or &quot;sovereign&quot; as the compelling 
                                              force that makes members of 
                                              society obey the law. There is 
                                              great doubt as to the internal 
                                              morality of legal rules and 
                                              regulations as the basis of 
                                              obedience to the state and the 
                                              law. There is some “class” truism 
                                              in the saying of the American 
                                              realist that &quot;what the courts say 
                                              in fact and nothing more 
                                              presumptuous ... is the law.&quot; 
                                              There is also reason in the 
                                              cultural and historical school of 
                                              thought as to what makes the law 
                                              efficacious. What I believe is 
                                              that for developing countries to 
                                              be able to break through the 
                                              vicious cycle of poverty, they 
                                              need to appreciate the scientific 
                                              basis of law as being the result 
                                              of economic activity within 
                                              society. This is the only basis on 
                                              which law can meaningfully be used 
                                              as a “tool of social engineering,” 
                                              not in the sense anticipated by Mr 
                                              Justice Holmes but in the sense of 
                                              the law being purposively used to 
                                              address the imbalances in the 
                                              society and to ensure that those 
                                              who support the economy by their 
                                              physical sweat and toil are given 
                                              the maximum protection of law to 
                                              fulfil their &quot;spiritual&quot; and 
                                              material needs. I do not need to 
                                              belabour the point that the 
                                              inspiring factor behind the 31 
                                              December Revolution has been the 
                                              need to uplift the spiritual and 
                                              material well being of our people. 
                                              I do not have to pass judgment on 
                                              that effort but, I believe, 
                                              history will give its impartial 
                                              assessment.</span></p>

                                              the instructions of his employer 
                                              or client. The instructions of a 
                                              government are its policies and 
                                              objectives.</span></p>

                                              It has been written that where a 
                                              client's brief is contrary to the 
                                              &quot;traditions of the Bar&quot;, &quot;the

                                              he must return his client's brief. 
                                              I think that an attorney who 
                                              strongly feels that the 
                                              instructions of a government are 
                                              against his conscience ought to 
                                              give over his brief and resign 
                                              from his employment. I am not 
                                              talking about the exceptional 
                                              cases where an attorney cannot 
                                              handle a particular case because 
                                              of some personal belief or 
                                              affinity. I am referring to the 
                                              general instructions or brief 
                                              which come out in the form of 
                                              policy objectives.</span></p>

                                              But are all these talks of the 
                                              relationship between 
                                              socio-economic development and law 
                                              relevant at this durbar? In my 
                                              view, they are. They form the 
                                              basis of what I think must inform 
                                              the thinking of the attorney 
                                              towards his employer. It is the 
                                              premises on which we should be 
                                              able to judge the performance of 
                                              the attorney. It is within this 
                                              context that we should be able to 
                                              measure whether we are assisting 
                                              in ensuring that justice which 
                                              ought to be available to the mass 
                                              of our people is getting to them. 
                                              It is my opinion that when an 
                                              attorney accepts to be in the 
                                              employ of the state after a 
                                              searching examination of his 
                                              conscience vis-a-vis the general 
                                              instructions of his employer, then 
                                              all the training and skill of the 
                                              attorney must be brought to bear 
                                              on his work to follow the 
                                              instructions of his client. It 
                                              means hours of solitary study that 
                                              enables him to master the details 
                                              of the government's case. There 
                                              should here be no difference 
                                              between the private legal 
                                              practitioner who has to work for 
                                              his fees and the attorney who is 
                                              paid monthly and given allowances 
                                              by the State. Should an attorney 
                                              decide to prosecute a case it must 
                                              be properly done. I believe when 
                                              an attorney has seriously studied 
                                              his brief and done long hours of 
                                              work on it he can achieve this 
                                              second goal easily.</span></p>

                                              other lawyers in practice and you 
                                              only need to research through the 
                                              files of this ministry to confirm 
                                              what I am saying. I remember for 
                                              instance, the case where on a writ 
                                              of summons and statement of claim 
                                              in a land matter a lawyer asked 
                                              for declaration of title, damages, 
                                              certiorari and prohibition among 
                                              his reliefs. These reliefs were 
                                              repeated on the statement of 
                                              claim. There was a statement of 
                                              defence, filed by an attorney of 
                                              this ministry, which denied and 
                                              answered the averments contained 
                                              in the writ and statement of 
                                              claim. This case went up to 
                                              summons for directions level and 
                                              directions were surprisingly

                                              This particular case betrays 
                                              either the staleness of the 
                                              lawyers who were handling the 
                                              matter or the lack of care on 
                                              their part. It is amazing that 
                                              certiorari and prohibition would 
                                              be indorsed on a writ and 
                                              statement of claim and that all 
                                              the processes would be allowed to 
                                              be gone through up to the stage of 
                                              hearing. In fact in this case the 
                                              hearing had begun. But is it not

                                              should apply to have the writ 
                                              struck off. When did the rules 
                                              change to say that if you are 
                                              seeking other reliefs you can 
                                              include a prerogative writ in 
                                              them? The Attorney-General and the 
                                              Solicitor-General can testify to 
                                              my shock and horror when I saw the 
                                              pleadings. There are other such 
                                              cases. They do not speak well of 
                                              our performance.</span></p>

                                              This leads me to the issue of 
                                              bringing up our young attorneys. 
                                              Mr Justice Annan has told me of 
                                              what this ministry used to be in 
                                              terms of the responsibility of 
                                              senior attorneys in the training 
                                              and bringing up of young 
                                              attorneys. You could not come to 
                                              the Attorney-General's Department 
                                              without going through rigorous 
                                              training in the hands of a senior 
                                              and a respectable attorney. These 
                                              seniors took pride in seeing the 
                                              distinguished performance of the 
                                              attorneys whose hands they had 
                                              held and led to court for the 
                                              first time. It was a pride for a 
                                              judge who was once at the 
                                              Attorney-General's Department to 
                                              see an attorney whom he had 
                                              brought up perform well in court.</span></p>

                                              Will the young attorneys that we 
                                              have say the same thing about us 
                                              tomorrow? Do they think the same 
                                              of us today? If they will think of 
                                              us in the negative then it means 
                                              we must find ways and means of 
                                              restoring the training tradition 
                                              of the past. I should also want us 
                                              to ask ourselves about what our 
                                              judges on the superior courts and 
                                              our own peers at the Bar think 
                                              about us. Do they think we are 
                                              discharging our duties creditably? 
                                              Do they think that most of the 
                                              time very junior attorneys are 
                                              sent to handle serious cases 
                                              before the courts? Do they see us 
                                              as dead woods? If they think of

                                              terms then we have the duty to 
                                              take effective steps to address 
                                              the situation.</span></p>

                                              The junior attorney in my opinion 
                                              must be a person who is prepared 
                                              to learn and to take instructions 
                                              from his seniors. He must be 
                                              inquisitive. He should endeavour 
                                              to read through the brief of his 
                                              senior and ask questions however 
                                              stupid they may appear to his 
                                              senior provided they appear 
                                              reasonable to him. Above all he 
                                              must be hardworking and produce 
                                              reasonable material when he is 
                                              assigned a job. The performance of 
                                              the junior attorney will determine 
                                              the enthusiasm of his senior to 
                                              devote time and energy to bring 
                                              him up. Let the junior attorney 
                                              remember that being called to the 
                                              Bar is just the beginning of a 
                                              profession. To be called a lawyer 
                                              means nothing when your law is 
                                              porous. Strengthen your knowledge 
                                              of the law and its practice and 
                                              you need not call yourself a 
                                              lawyer. You will be so acclaimed.</span></p>

                                              be used within the context of our 
                                              social development in an

                                              This happened in Britain which we 
                                              now look up to whether objectively 
                                              or subjectively as a bastion of 
                                              liberty. We in Ghana are in a 
                                              different stage of development and 
                                              the attorney's performance must be 
                                              such as to attract the general 
                                              acceptance of the mass of the 
                                              public. When the public which 
                                              deals with us feels that we are 
                                              dishonest we could also be made to 
                                              scramble off with &quot;the agility of

                                              Let us recall the peasant revolt 
                                              of 1381, let us learn from 4 June 
                                              1979 and 31 December 1981. History 
                                              has always been on the side of the 
                                              people and so must the law. I 
                                              would like to conclude on the note 
                                              of certain specific developments 
                                              at the Attorney-General's 
                                              Department. I see the need for a 
                                              Public International Law and 
                                              International Trade and Investment 
                                              Unit in this ministry. I have 
                                              discussed this with the 
                                              Attorney-General and other members 
                                              of the Council. I also see the 
                                              need for a section in the Director 
                                              of Public Prosecutions' Department 
                                              to study all judgments in criminal 
                                              cases particularly those carrying 
                                              capital sentence and to advise us. 
                                              I have raised these issues before 
                                              and they are being addressed. Time 
                                              does not allow me to expatiate on 
                                              them. I see them as ways of 
                                              improving our performance and the 
                                              lot of our people.</span></p>

                                              When a judge tries a case, he 
                                              usually reserves judgment, ie he 
                                              postpones the giving of the 
                                              decision to a date convenient to 
                                              himself. Under the current law, it 
                                              can be as long as four weeks in 
                                              the case of the district courts 
                                              and the circuit courts, six weeks 
                                              in the case of the High Court and 
                                              the Court of Appeal, and eight 
                                              weeks in the case of the Supreme 
                                              Court. When I was invited to speak 
                                              to you, I thought I would be given 
                                              eight weeks to prepare. To my 
                                              utter surprise I found that the 
                                              date had already been fixed and 
                                              that I could not reserve judgment. 
                                              I have had to come before you and 
                                              share my thoughts with you at a 
                                              week's notice. If, therefore, you 
                                              find any shortcomings in this 
                                              address I hope you will be 
                                              charitable and put them down to 
                                              lack of adequate preparation. In 
                                              any case, as you well know, there 
                                              is no right of appeal from the 
                                              opinions I am about to express. I 
                                              have been told that I can speak on 
                                              any topic I like.&nbsp; If I were to 
                                              indulge myself, I would 
                                              undoubtedly choose the art of 
                                              speaking and begin with two 
                                              quotations. First: &quot;I mislike not 
                                              the matter so much as the manner 
                                              of his speech.” Second: &quot;Words are 
                                              the dress of thoughts, which 
                                              should no more be presented in 
                                              rags, tatters and dirt, than your 
                                              person should.&quot; Every lawyer 
                                              knows, or ought to know, of the 
                                              importance of the spoken and 
                                              written word as a means of 
                                              communication. These are his 
                                              tools-of-trade without which he 
                                              cannot function.</span></p>

                                              In this country, where we have to

                                              In times past, the nations of 
                                              Europe were in a similar 
                                              situation. Academic work was done, 
                                              not in their native tongues, but 
                                              in Latin. Those trained in the law 
                                              and the sciences had of necessity 
                                              to acquire a sound knowledge of it 
                                              and apply it to their needs. 
                                              Frederick the Great of Prussia 
                                              once said: &quot;I speak Latin to my

                                              English to my gardener, and German 
                                              to my horse”. And when, on another 
                                              occasion, he was invited to listen 
                                              to a German singer he said: &quot;A

                                              Latin. Let us spend a little more 
                                              time reading the great works of 
                                              literature, make a more constant

                                              our thoughts and ideas and our

                                              But before lawyers whose task it 
                                              is to advise governments and 
                                              defend their actions in court, I 
                                              cannot think of a more appropriate 
                                              subject than that of whether any 
                                              laws can be permanent. But in the 
                                              abstract, the question: &quot;Are there 
                                              any permanent laws?&quot; evokes only 
                                              one answer; and, that is, No. Even 
                                              the laws of science have been 
                                              shown not to be permanent. There 
                                              are deserts where four thousand 
                                              years ago there were green 
                                              pastures watered by great rivers; 
                                              and some scientists have made bold 
                                              to predict that in a few millions 
                                              of years the earth will collide 
                                              with the sun and burn up. If the 
                                              revolution of the moon around the 
                                              earth and of the earth around the 
                                              sun is not permanent, how can any 
                                              man-made laws ever be 
                                              unchangeable?</span></p>

                                              marvel that only a few years ago 
                                              some members of our profession 
                                              could peddle the idea that certain 
                                              laws made by a government had been 
                                              so framed as to make its actions 
                                              and those of its organs permanent 
                                              and unchangeable. I stood out 
                                              against this and was pilloried in 
                                              a manner reminiscent of Dr 
                                              Stockman in Ibsen's play &quot;Enemy of

                                              conference and roundly condemned 
                                              my decision. Some of my brother 
                                              judges asked if I was out to prove 
                                              how brave I was. In those trying 
                                              times, I often reflected on the 
                                              life of Galileo, the seventeenth 
                                              century physicist who was solemnly 
                                              tried for heresy and condemned for 
                                              asserting, contrary to popular 
                                              belief, that the earth revolves 
                                              round the sun.</span></p>

                                              Before this audience I would not 
                                              wish to revive old memories by 
                                              dilating on that episode: it would 
                                              be like stoking the fire after it 
                                              has been burnt to cinders. What I

                                              impermanency of institutions, 
                                              sacred cows and laws is to

                                              In this country, there is not so 
                                              much weeping and wailing as when a 
                                              bread-winner dies. It is not the 
                                              mere loss of a dear one, the pain 
                                              of parting that makes people weep 
                                              at funerals. All too often, 
                                              mourners are concerned with such 
                                              mundane things as where the next

                                              is going to come from. I have 
                                              attended funerals where I have 
                                              heard wailing women ask the 
                                              deceased, “Who is going to pay the 
                                              electricity bills?” If the 
                                              deceased is a husband and father 
                                              who leaves behind a widow and 
                                              infant children, the situation can 
                                              be very terrifying indeed. Few 
                                              people are able to make adequate 
                                              provision for their dependants 
                                              during their lifetime. When they 
                                              die, the situation is much worse. 
                                              It is not enough to have left a 
                                              house or two, or even a thriving 
                                              business enterprise. Unless the 
                                              deceased has left a will in which 
                                              provision has been made for his 
                                              dependants, they may find 
                                              themselves at the mercy of the 
                                              deceased's relatives.</span></p>

                                              In our matrilineal communities the 
                                              orthodox view is that children do 
                                              not inherit their father and can 
                                              only look forward to support from

                                              out of the matrimonial home by

                                              been able to come to the aid of

                                              Let us take a closer look at three 
                                              of such cases, the first being In 
                                              re Kofi Antubam (Decd); Quaico v 
                                              Fosu [1965] GLR 138, Kofi Antubam, 
                                              a native of Wassa, was an artist 
                                              who excelled and became well-known 
                                              both in and outside the country. 
                                              He died intestate leaving behind 
                                              two widows and nine children. No 
                                              sooner had this sad event occurred 
                                              than his maternal family decided 
                                              to test the rights of the widows 
                                              and children in court. The suit 
                                              was to determine whether they had 
                                              any interest in the estate, or 
                                              were entitled only to maintenance, 
                                              the latter having been held to be

                                              or no estate; and that the right

                                              GLR 110. Daniel Myles Abadoo, Snr, 
                                              father of the Cape Coast lawyer, 
                                              had in 1891 made a deed of gift 
                                              conveying certain land with a 
                                              building thereon to his wife and 
                                              children. Later Daniel Myles 
                                              Abadoo, Jnr, the lawyer, erected, 
                                              with his own funds, another 
                                              building on part of the land. By 
                                              his will he devised this house to 
                                              his own wife and children. The 
                                              question that arose was whether or 
                                              not the house could be devised by 
                                              him by will in favour of his wife 
                                              and children. Wiredu J, as he then 
                                              was, held that there was a 
                                              distinction between a house built 
                                              by a family member on vacant 
                                              family land and one built by him 
                                              on land in use by the family; in 
                                              the former case, the house is his 
                                              absolute property and, in the 
                                              latter, he acquires only a 
                                              life-interest in it. He relied on 
                                              Ansah v Sackey (1958) 3 WALR 325;

                                              SC and on a passage at page 42 of 
                                              Ollennu's Customary Land Law in 
                                              Ghana. He however differed from 
                                              Ollennu in that he thought it was 
                                              not enough that there should be a 
                                              structure of just any sort on the

                                              that the land was in actual use 
                                              and occupation by the family. In

                                              The three cases under review show 
                                              the lengths to which some of our 
                                              judges have been prepared to go to 
                                              assuage the severity of the 
                                              customary law rules. Archer J 
                                              claimed for widows and children a 
                                              right to rent out portions of the 
                                              house of their deceased husband 
                                              and father which has become family 
                                              property; Hayfron-Benjamin J 
                                              asserted that children of an 
                                              Ordinance marriage could claim 
                                              property rights under customary 
                                              law; and, after conceding that the 
                                              Abadoo house was family property, 
                                              Wiredu J defined that family in 
                                              such wide terms as to include the 
                                              children of the deceased. In this 
                                              state of near confusion 
                                              legislation has had to be 
                                              introduced to bring the law in 
                                              line with current ideas of what is 
                                              just and proper.</span></p>

                                              All this goes to show that there 
                                              are good laws and bad laws. Our

                                              There were also laws which for 
                                              many centuries kept women in 
                                              subjection to men. Magna Carta was 
                                              a charter for men's rights. It was

                                              women were given the right to

                                              The Greek philosopher Heracleitus 
                                              is famous for the saying that: 
                                              “All is flux, nothing stays 
                                              still.&quot; By this, he meant that 
                                              nothing was permanent. Not man, 
                                              not the institutions created by 
                                              him, not even the universe. Of all 
                                              transient things, laws are among 
                                              the most ephemeral, likely to be 
                                              revised, modified or rejected in 
                                              later years. Let us not deceive 
                                              ourselves that we can frame laws 
                                              which will meet the needs of 
                                              posterity for all time. Rather, 
                                              let us with humility set our 
                                              sights lower and seek to solve the 
                                              problems of our day as best as we 
                                              can, leaving the rest to future

                                              sovereign Republic. Its continued

                                              be due to the lethargic manner in
