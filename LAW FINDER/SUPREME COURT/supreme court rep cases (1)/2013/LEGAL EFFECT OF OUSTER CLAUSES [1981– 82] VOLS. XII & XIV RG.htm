                                              After the issue of the decree of 
                                              divorce by the courts in 
                                              California, U.S., the husband 
                                              defaulted on the payments of the 
                                              weekly maintenance as agreed 
                                              upon.&nbsp; The wife sued in England 
                                              for the arrears of maintenance. 
                                              The husband contended that the 
                                              action was not maintainable in an 
                                              English court because it was void 
                                              and contrary to public policy in 
                                              that it purported to oust the 
                                              jurisdiction of a foreign court, 
                                              i.e. the U.S. courts. It was held 
                                              that although the maintenance 
                                              agreement would have been contrary 
                                              to public policy, and therefore, 
                                              void, if it had purported to oust 
                                              the jurisdiction of the English 
                                              courts, public policy did not 
                                              forbid the wife from suing on the 
                                              agreement in the English courts 
                                              merely because the agreement 
                                              purported to oust the jurisdiction 
                                              of a foreign court. </span></p>

                                              domestic tribunal is founded on&nbsp; 
                                              contract, express or implied, 
                                              nevertheless the parties are not 
                                              free to make any contract they 
                                              like. There are important 
                                              limitations imposed by public 
                                              policy.&nbsp; The tribunal must, for 
                                              instance, observe the principles 
                                              of natural justice. They must give 
                                              the man notice of the charge and a 
                                              reasonable opportunity of meeting 
                                              it. Any stipulation to the 
                                              contrary would be invalid . . . 
                                              Another limitation arises out of 
                                              the well-known principle that 
                                              parties cannot by contract oust 
                                              the ordinary courts of their 
                                              jurisdiction . . . They can, 
                                              indeed, make the tribunal the 
                                              final arbiter on questions of 
                                              fact, but they cannot make it the 
                                              final arbiter on questions of 
                                              law.&quot; </span></p>

                                              the court until after the 
                                              expiration of ten years; the 
                                              parties themselves had so agreed.

                                              on the facts of the case. No 
                                              reasons prevented the parties from 
                                              entering into such a contract as 
                                              was contained in clause 15 and 
                                              that indeed there was much to be 
                                              said for that clause as the 
                                              parties would wish to maintain the 
                                              company as a going concern during 
                                              the currency of the agreement.</span></p>

                                              appeal. It is suggested that 
                                              further hearing of the winding-up 
                                              petition could not have been 
                                              proceeded with before the High 
                                              Court in the face of the 
                                              exclusionary clause which the 
                                              Court of Appeal decreed as still 
                                              binding on the parties. It appears 
                                              that the court should rather have 
                                              upheld the dismissal of the suit 
                                              by the trial judge on the ground 
                                              of the exclusionary clause, with a

                                              might bring a fresh action setting

                                              provided by the Local Government

                                              that the tribunal had properly 
                                              exercised its jurisdiction under

                                              within its jurisdiction, had

                                              founded on such insufficient or 
                                              inadmissible evidence could not be

                                              amounted to a mistake of law, such 
                                              a mistake of law, even if it was 
                                              apparent on the face of the 
                                              record, would not affect the 
                                              operation of an ouster clause so 
                                              long as the inferior tribunal had 
                                              acted within its jurisdiction. The 
                                              only remedy available to the 
                                              applicant was to appeal against 
                                              the conviction. </span></p>

                                              Denning M.R. pointed out51 that 
                                              the distinction between an error 
                                              of law entailing absence of 
                                              jurisdiction, and an error of law 
                                              made within jurisdiction (which 
                                              Taylor J. was at pains to make in 
                                              the Forson case) was very fine and 
                                              argued that the distinction should 
                                              be abolished. Lord Denning 
                                              suggested the way out52:</span></p>

                                              The facts were that a dispute 
                                              arose between the appellant 
                                              company and the respondent, a 
                                              trade union. It was referred under 
                                              the 1967 Act to the industrial 
                                              court which made an award in

                                              court, held against the company 
                                              that the words of the ouster 
                                              clause in section 29 (3) (a) were 
                                              wide enough to oust the 
                                              jurisdiction of the High Court to 
                                              review the decision by certiorari, 
                                              although they would not have 
                                              excluded the jurisdiction of the 
                                              High Court if the industrial court 
                                              had exceeded its jurisdiction. The 
                                              Privy Council further held that,

                                              was still available to correct an 
                                              error of law on the face of the 
                                              record, notwithstanding the ouster 
                                              clause, a distinction was to be 
                                              drawn between an error of law 
                                              which affected jurisdiction and 
                                              one which did not. It held that,

                                              fact that the Malaysia Act had

                                              clearly intended to exclude 
                                              certiorari by making the opinion 
                                              of the Attorney-General on a

                                              the industrial court binding on 
                                              the court) the award by the 
                                              industrial court was not subject 
                                              to review merely on the ground of 
                                              error of law on the face of the 
                                              record.&nbsp; Since the award in 
                                              question was within the 
                                              jurisdiction of the industrial 
                                              court, the Act had, any errors of 
                                              law contained on its face 
                                              notwithstanding, effectively 
                                              ousted the jurisdiction of the 
                                              High Court to quash the award.&nbsp; 
                                              More importantly, the Privy 
                                              Council held that the suggestion 
                                              by Lord Denning M.R., that a 
                                              distinction should be drawn 
                                              between an error on which the 
                                              decision depends, and one on which 
                                              the decision does not depend 
                                              should be discarded. </span></p>

                                              The Bradlaugh case turned on a 
                                              provision that a magistrate had to 
                                              be satisfied with two named 
                                              conditions before issuing an order 
                                              for a warrant of search. The 
                                              magistrate had overlooked one of 
                                              the said conditions and therefore 
                                              his order was set aside as a 
                                              nullity. The court in this case 
                                              per Mellor J. said,57 “It is well 
                                              established that the provision 
                                              taking away the certiorari does 
                                              not apply where there was an 
                                              absence of jurisdiction.&quot; 
                                              Continuing he said,58&nbsp; “The 
                                              consequence of holding otherwise 
                                              would be that a metropolitan 
                                              magistrate could make any order he 
                                              pleased without question.&quot; And in 
                                              the Smith case, the statute in 
                                              question provided that, &quot;. . . no 
                                              judgment or order of any judge of 
                                              county courts . . . shall be 
                                              removed by appeal, motion, 
                                              certiorari or otherwise into any 
                                              other court whatever&quot; except in 
                                              the manner mentioned by the Act.&nbsp; 
                                              The court per Lord Parker C.J. 
                                              held that certiorari would lie 
                                              against a county court judge if he 
                                              had acted without jurisdiction, 
                                              notwithstanding the provisions of 
                                              the County Courts Act.</span></p>

                                              Foreign Compensation Commission.59 
                                              In this case the court had to 
                                              construe section 4 (4) of the 
                                              Foreign Compensation Act, 1950, 
                                              which provided, &quot;The determination 
                                              by the Commission of any 
                                              application made to them shall not 
                                              be called in question in any court 
                                              of law.&quot; The appellants' claim to 
                                              compensation was dismissed by the 
                                              commission.&nbsp; In determining a 
                                              claim by the appellants, the 
                                              commission considered that it was 
                                              bound by the relevant order to 
                                              determine whether the appellants 
                                              had a &quot;successor in title&quot; and if 
                                              so whether such successor was a 
                                              British national.&nbsp; The commission 
                                              felt obliged to dismiss the claim 
                                              when it concluded that the 
                                              appellants had a successor in 
                                              title who was not a British 
                                              national.&nbsp; The House of Lords held 
                                              that, since the order did not in 
                                              fact require the commission to 
                                              make any determination about 
                                              &quot;successors in title&quot; or their 
                                              nationality, the commission had 
                                              based its decision “on some matter 
                                              which, under the provisions 
                                              setting it up, it had no right to 
                                              take into account.&quot; Therefore the 
                                              apparent or purported 
                                              determination was a nulliy and no 
                                              determination at all and the 
                                              ouster clause would not apply. The 
                                              House of Lords also held that, if 
                                              the inferior tribunal had merely 
                                              made an error of law which did not 
                                              affect its jurisdiction and if its 
                                              decision was not a nullity for 
                                              some reason such as breach of the 
                                              rules of natural justice, then the 
                                              ouster clause would have been 
                                              effective.</span></p>

                                              to have been tried by the special 
                                              court and that the alleged warrant 
                                              of commitment was issued by that 
                                              court or any person authorised by

                                              judgment (with two judges of the 
                                              seven-member panel dissenting) 
                                              dismissed the plaintiff’s claim 
                                              and held that, even though on the 
                                              evidence placed before it, there 
                                              was no proof of judicial action 
                                              taken, i.e. an action satisfying 
                                              the requirements of the law both 
                                              procedurally and substantively, 
                                              there was proof of a purported 
                                              judicial action taken, i.e. an 
                                              action which looked like, or was

                                              outward appearance of a judicial 
                                              action.&nbsp; The majority took the 
                                              view that there was a purported 
                                              trial because it was satisfied 
                                              with the evidence before it that, 
                                              when the special court met, it 
                                              intended to try the plaintiff 
                                              under A.F.R.C.D.3 as amended by

                                              him if found guilty.&nbsp; The court by 
                                              its majority decision also held 
                                              that the effect of section 15(3) 
                                              of the transitional provisions was 
                                              that compliance with &quot;any 
                                              procedure prescribed by law”71 was

                                              of the ouster clause in section

                                              In the light of the evidence 
                                              placed before the Supreme Court as 
                                              to the trial of the plaintiff 
                                              before the special court, it is 
                                              plausible to argue that there was 
                                              some sort of a trial.72 The 
                                              evidence given by one of the 
                                              witnesses called by the defence 
                                              was that he was present during the 
                                              trial in absentia of the plaintiff 
                                              by the special tribunal.&nbsp; 
                                              According to that witness, the 
                                              charges against the plaintiff were 
                                              read by the prosecutor apparently 
                                              from a file containing the dossier 
                                              on him and that a panel of more 
                                              than five persons conferred for 
                                              about 20-25 minutes and thereafter 
                                              adjudged the plaintiff guilty.</span></p>

                                              But there was a very important 
                                              issue raised by Taylor J.S.C. in 
                                              his dissenting opinion which was

                                              opinion in the Kwakye case: was it 
                                              necessary for special tribunal to 
                                              hear evidence before convicting 
                                              the plaintiff?&nbsp; There was no 
                                              evidence that in the course of the 
                                              purported trial before the special 
                                              tribunal any witness was called to 
                                              give evidence against the 
                                              plaintiff. In his dissenting 
                                              opinion, Taylor J.S.C. took the 
                                              view that the only way a court 
                                              could try a case was to have 
                                              evidence either orally or by 
                                              affidavit or any other way 
                                              expressly provided by law.&nbsp; In the 
                                              absence of any of these, there 
                                              could be no trial or appearance of 
                                              a trial or a purported trial. In 
                                              his view the need for calling 
                                              evidence was &quot;not just a 
                                              procedural requirement, it [was] a 
                                              substantive requirement.&quot; If it is 
                                              conceded that the calling of 
                                              evidence was a sine qua non of a 
                                              trial by the special tribunal 
                                              under A.F.R.C.D. 3, s. 5, then one 
                                              may be unable to defend the 
                                              majority opinion that there was a 
                                              purported trial since the evidence 
                                              laid before the Supreme Court 
                                              showed conclusively that no 
                                              witness was called to give 
                                              evidence against the plaintiff

                                              absence, there must have been a

                                              nullity?&nbsp; The law appears to be 
                                              settled that where an act by an 
                                              inferior tribunal is proved to be 
                                              illegal, the existence of an 
                                              ouster clause would not prevent 
                                              the High Court from quashing the 
                                              illegal act.&nbsp; In the words of Lord 
                                              Reid in Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign

                                              jurisdiction of the court has been 
                                              held to protect a nullity.&quot; And in 
                                              the Kwakye case, Taylor J.S.C. in 
                                              his dissenting opinion held that 
                                              the act of unknown, nameless 
                                              persons assembling and without 
                                              hearing evidence sentencing the 
                                              plaintiff in absentia (as the 
                                              evidence brought before the 
                                              Supreme Court showed) was not a 
                                              judicial act but an illegal act.&nbsp; 
                                              Such an illegal act could not be 
                                              said to be &quot;a judicial action

                                              meaning of section 15 (2) and (3) 
                                              of the transitional provisions.&nbsp; 
                                              In the words of Taylor J.S.C., &quot;an 
                                              action can be a judicial action or 
                                              a purported judicial action if not 
                                              capricious or illegal . . .&quot; In so 
                                              holding, his lordship relied on 
                                              the Israeli Supreme Court decision 
                                              in Orthodox Coptic Bishop of 
                                              Jerusalem v. Minister of 
                                              Police.75&nbsp; In this case, the 
                                              members of the Ethiopian Church 
                                              had illegally deprived the 
                                              petitioners and the Coptic Church 
                                              from having access to a passage 
                                              leading to the Holy Sepulchre in 
                                              Jerusalem.&nbsp; The petitioners 
                                              complained that the Minister of 
                                              Police had refused to allow them 
                                              to remove the Ethiopian locks to 
                                              regain possession.&nbsp; The respondent 
                                              minister raised an objection to 
                                              the jurisdiction of the 
                                              court—contending that matters 
                                              relating to the Holy Places were 
                                              not justiciable by the court, 
                                              because, a British Statute still 
                                              in force, i.e. the Palestine (Holy 
                                              Places) Order-in-Council, 1924, 
                                              art. 2, had provided that &quot;No

                                              the Holy Places . . . shall be 
                                              determined or heard in any court 
                                              in Palestine.&quot; And article 3 had 
                                              also provided that &quot;If any 
                                              question arises whether any cause 
                                              or matter comes within the 
                                              preceding article, such question 
                                              shall . . . be referred to the 
                                              High Commissioners . . . whose 
                                              decision . . . shall be final and 
                                              binding. . .&quot; The Israeli Supreme 
                                              Court rejected the contention of 
                                              the respondent that the ouster 
                                              clause had deprived it of 
                                              jurisdiction and held that if it 
                                              declined jurisdiction, it would in 
                                              effect legitimize a manifestly 
                                              illegal act and encourage 
                                              lawlessness by religious

                                              There is much to be said for 
                                              ouster clauses both in private 
                                              documents and in statutory 
                                              provisions.&nbsp; The courts should 
                                              give their blessing to an

                                              demonstrated, it is against public 
                                              policy for parties to reserve to 
                                              themselves final authority on the

                                              The rationale for the formulation 
                                              of an ouster clause in a statutory 
                                              provision, especially in penal 
                                              legislation, may be founded on (a) 
                                              the need for a speedy trial for 
                                              alleged economic and political 
                                              crimes in a revolutionary period; 
                                              (b) the need to assign the 
                                              determination of certain legal 
                                              issues to a special body with the 
                                              requisite expertise and knowledge 
                                              on specific matters; and (c) the 
                                              need to avoid frivolous and 
                                              vexatious proceedings after due 
                                              determination by special bodies 
                                              empowered by law to deal with such

                                              But as our discussion has amply 
                                              demonstrated, there is nothing 
                                              sacrosanct in ouster clauses

                                              that an ouster clause would be 
                                              inoperative: if a tribunal acts 
                                              without jurisdiction or in excess 
                                              of its specified jurisdiction; if 
                                              the conditions precedent for the 
                                              application of the ouster clause 
                                              are non-existent; if a tribunal 
                                              commits an illegal act such as the 
                                              refusal to take in evidence 
                                              against required by law to be 
                                              mandatory and as one writer has 
                                              authoritatively shown76 if the 
                                              tribunal is improperly constituted 
                                              or commits breach of natural 
                                              justice or where its decision is 
                                              tainted with fraud. </span></p>

                                              It may therefore be stated that

                                              involves judicial examination of a

                                              is not being used in a derogatory

                                              clearly circumscribed and more 
                                              limited compared with the 
                                              unlimited jurisdiction of the

                                              64. The appellant sought to 
                                              exercise the right of appeal 
                                              conferred as of right by the 
                                              Constitution, 1979, art. 198 (2) 
                                              and s. 11 of the transitional 
                                              provisions. It appears the Court 
                                              of Appeal had no jurisdiction to 
                                              entertain the appeal because the 
                                              effect of section 17 (5) of the 
                                              transition provisions, was that a 
                                              person affected by any adverse 
                                              findings of a committee of inquiry 
                                              which on the coming into force of 
                                              the Constitution, 1979, had not 
                                              submitted its report to the 
                                              A.F.R.C (such as the appellant) 
                                              was only entitled under section 17 
                                              (3) of the transitional provision, 
                                              to apply to the special tribunal 
                                              created under A.F.R.C.D 23 for a 
                                              review of the adverse findings. He 
                                              had no right of appeal to the 
                                              Court of Appeal as conferred by 
                                              article 198 (2) of the 
                                              constitution. If this is correct, 
                                              then the decision in Darkwa case 
                                              was given per incuriam and 
                                              therefore a nullity.</span></p>
