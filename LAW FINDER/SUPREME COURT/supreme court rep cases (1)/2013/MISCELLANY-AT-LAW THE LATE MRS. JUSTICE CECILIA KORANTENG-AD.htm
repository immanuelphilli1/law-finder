                                              murder; whilst Joachim Amartey

                                              murder. The public tribunal 
                                              sentenced all the five convicted 
                                              persons to death by firing squad:

                                              accused, had in fact earlier been 
                                              executed by firing squad for his 
                                              role in the June 19 abortive coup 
                                              against the P.N.D.C. The fifth

                                              This is not the first time that it 
                                              has fallen to my lot to pay 
                                              tribute to a departed one. I have 
                                              had this duty imposed on me on a 
                                              number of occasions. But this one 
                                              is sadly unique and I cannot bring 
                                              myself to do it without a feeling 
                                              of intense grief. The 
                                              circumstances in which the judges 
                                              met their end, are not now news. 
                                              It would be more than human if any 
                                              portrait that I paint of them is 
                                              not coloured by the shared feeling 
                                              of grief which we are all 
                                              experiencing at the present time. 
                                              I would mention them not in their 
                                              order of seniority in our records, 
                                              but according to their ages: Mr. 
                                              Justice K. A. Agyepong happens to 
                                              be the oldest in age. Born at 
                                              Oyoko, Ashanti on 17 November 
                                              1926, he will be 56 next November. 
                                              After primary school in his 
                                              home-town, he went to Mfantsipim, 
                                              Cape Coast, in 1942. When he 
                                              finished there in 1946, he was 
                                              retained to teach there. He was 
                                              obviously a good English student 
                                              and he taught English, Latin and 
                                              Mathematics in his alma mater. 
                                              When he left Mfantsipim, he held 
                                              short teaching appointments at 
                                              Ghana National College, Cape 
                                              Coast, and at the Accra High 
                                              School. But teaching was not his 
                                              destined career. In October 1955, 
                                              he entered the English Inns of 
                                              Court and pursued a course in law. 
                                              He became a fully fledged lawyer 
                                              in February 1960.</span></p>

                                              Upon his return to Ghana in 1961, 
                                              he entered private practice in 
                                              Kumasi. It was at that time, as it

                                              Prempeh, Justice Siriboe, Justice

                                              his determination to hold his own

                                              I am able to say this of my own 
                                              knowledge.&nbsp; </span></p>

                                              In 1977 when the Judicial Council 
                                              decided to elevate a lawyer of 
                                              proven merit and integrity from 
                                              the Ashanti Bar, his name was 
                                              submitted by the then presiding 
                                              judge. The Judicial Council had no 
                                              difficulty in endorsing his 
                                              candidature. Accordingly, on 27 
                                              September 1977, he was appointed a 
                                              judge of the High Court. He has 
                                              been stationed in Accra ever 
                                              since. His performance on the 
                                              bench satisfied me that the 
                                              Judicial Council's selection of 
                                              him was right. It was plain he was 
                                              in love with his judicial work and 
                                              sat in court long after official

                                              judging from his work, is that

                                              gave him a great deal of 
                                              satisfaction. His capacity for 
                                              work was prodigious and it was my 
                                              habit to push on to him cases not 
                                              on his normal schedule. He 
                                              accepted without hesitation. The 
                                              only complaint the lawyers make of 
                                              him is that he tends to be a 
                                              little garrulous. That is not a 
                                              serious handicap in a judge but 
                                              that was to be expected of a man 
                                              who began in a profession in which 
                                              talkativeness is an asset.</span></p>

                                              His willingness to accept extra

                                              illustrated in May 1979 when in 
                                              the midst of heavy judicial 
                                              work-load, he readily agreed to 
                                              serve as a chairman of a committee

                                              Having been in Accra continuously 
                                              for five years, he was due to be 
                                              transferred. On 17 May 1982, I 
                                              wrote notifying him of his 
                                              transfer to Cape Coast in the 
                                              ensuing legal year in October. I 
                                              did not then realise that he was 
                                              being returned to the one 
                                              town—Cape Coast—whose scholarly 
                                              environment decided his academic 
                                              bent. I was told later that he was 
                                              delighted at the idea. Little did 
                                              Justice Agyepong or I know that he 
                                              would not return to Cape Coast. He 
                                              was a simple and unassuming man 
                                              and it is hard to believe that he 
                                              would have seriously harmed anyone 
                                              or any would have designs on his 
                                              life. But the cruel fate that 
                                              befell him on Wednesday, 30 June 
                                              1982, is now stale news. And he 
                                              will not go to Cape Coast in 
                                              October. He will this day be sent 
                                              to his permanent resting-place at 
                                              Osu and he would lie with some of

                                              next month. He began his legal

                                              through the ranks—so to speak, and 
                                              in May 1971, had become a

                                              My acquaintance with him began in 
                                              the middle 60s when his assignment 
                                              was to appear for the State in 
                                              criminal matters before the Court 
                                              of Appeal. As an advocate, he was 
                                              cool and collected. Although 
                                              driving his points home with 
                                              conviction, he was the very 
                                              embodiment of courtesy. That 
                                              gentleman of a lawyer, we would 
                                              say, if we knew he was to appear 
                                              in a particular case.</span></p>

                                              In May 1971, he was elevated to 
                                              the High Court and joined what we 
                                              call the judicial fraternity. He 
                                              worked conscientiously and well 
                                              and is reputed to have in

                                              judges lack—judicial taciturnity. 
                                              He would listen for hours, 
                                              unsmiling and with attention to 
                                              legal argument without showing the 
                                              least sign of boredom. He has a 
                                              habit of delivering his judgments 
                                              on time because he had a firm 
                                              grasp of principle and could make 
                                              up his mind firmly and without

                                              Because of his great experience in 
                                              criminal work, many lawyers, 
                                              myself included, thought that he 
                                              would have no truck with civil 
                                              work. But that is incorrect. There 
                                              were occasions when he came to me, 
                                              when on criminal schedule, to ask 
                                              to be assigned civil work in 
                                              addition. I believe he enjoyed 
                                              these more because of the variety 
                                              of cases on every subject.</span></p>

                                              the other part of his life—at home 
                                              with his wife Yvonne whom he 
                                              adored and his darling children. 
                                              Their welfare was his dearest

                                              unburdened his heart to me about

                                              because his posting was uncertain 
                                              and he had to commute between 
                                              Accra-Ho and some times Tamale. He 
                                              said the prolonged parting from 
                                              his wife and children was causing 
                                              him great unhappiness</span></p>

                                              educated at Holy Child School, 
                                              Cape Coast, and the University of 
                                              Hull, England. She graduated

                                              June 1962. In June 1963, she was

                                              In July 1966, she joined our 
                                              judicial rank as a district 
                                              magistrate. It was clear from her 
                                              performance that she had bright 
                                              prospects in her freely chosen 
                                              field. In October 1971, she earned 
                                              promotion as a circuit judge. She 
                                              then climbed the judicial ladder 
                                              fairly quickly. In April 1975, she 
                                              was appointed as an acting judge 
                                              of the High Court. There was 
                                              little doubt that her appointment 
                                              to the substantive post was only a 
                                              question of time. It came two 
                                              years later, in October 1977 when 
                                              she was appointed to the Superior 
                                              Court Bench as a High Court Judge.</span></p>

                                              As an acting High Court Judge, she 
                                              was posted to Kumasi on 1 July 
                                              1975. The Bar was apprehensive 
                                              whether she could cope in view of 
                                              the volume of litigation in the 
                                              Ashanti capital. Not only did she 
                                              cope but when she was transferred 
                                              to Accra in 1977, so she could 
                                              join her husband, then 
                                              Attorney-General, a delegation of 
                                              the Ashanti Bar called on me and 
                                              pleaded with me to let her remain 
                                              in Kumasi. They could not conceive 
                                              of the smooth flow of work without 
                                              her. I could not oblige. In Accra, 
                                              as in Kumasi, she took her 
                                              judicial duties seriously and I 
                                              regularly received with intense 
                                              pride glowing reports about her 
                                              judicial competence. Though not 
                                              robust in build, she was extremely 
                                              robust in mind and had guts. She 
                                              was endowed with one of the 
                                              qualities that is indispensable in 
                                              a good judge—namely, the courage 
                                              of her conviction. It did not

                                              she was posted, either in the

                                              family schedule, I asked her to

                                              High Court can entertain a

                                              She wrote what I can only describe

                                              depth in which you analysed the 
                                              matter and the process of 
                                              reasoning by which you came to 
                                              your clearly correct view. I am 
                                              grateful for it and have nothing 
                                              but the highest admiration for the 
                                              clarity of thought and the legal 
                                              scholarship exhibited in your 
                                              approach.&quot;</span></p>

                                              This letter was placed in her 
                                              personal confidential file and it 
                                              is from it that I made the above

                                              She was, consistent with her 
                                              upbringing, extremely high-minded 
                                              and innately refined. I believe 
                                              the profession would agree that 
                                              her reputation for integrity is 
                                              impeccable. She was not without 
                                              fault. I had on occasions queried 
                                              her for delayed judgments and 
                                              reminded her of the much-quoted 
                                              judicial slogan—justice delayed is 
                                              justice denied or as others put it 
                                              justice is sweetest when it is 
                                              freshest. She often pleaded in 
                                              mitigation, her other obligations. 
                                              She was a housewife as well as a 
                                              mother and had a house to keep. 
                                              That, of course, I always 
                                              understand.</span></p>

                                              such circumstances. It is 
                                              unbelievable that persons against 
                                              whom these innocent men and woman 
                                              had no grudge or quarrel, could 
                                              dish out such outrageous treatment 
                                              to their bodies. We are saddened, 
                                              we are shocked, we are dismayed at 
                                              this melancholy news. May they 
                                              rest in peace.</span></p>

                                              One cannot pay tribute to these 
                                              illustrious children of Ghana 
                                              without recalling the singular 
                                              contributions made by all of them 
                                              in their respective fields of 
                                              human endeavour towards the 
                                              reshaping of our society in Ghana. 
                                              These three judges of the Superior 
                                              Court of judicature, namely. Mrs. 
                                              Justice Cecilia Koranteng-Addow, 
                                              Mr. Justice Fred Sarkordie and Mr. 
                                              Justice K. A. Agyepong can be 
                                              regarded as shining examples on 
                                              the Bench. They proved themselves 
                                              in the type of decisions they gave 
                                              during the period they all served 
                                              as judges. To members of the Bar, 
                                              the expectation that they would 
                                              get justice whenever they appeared 
                                              before any of them was always 
                                              current. It is well known that 
                                              many members of the Bar were even 
                                              satisfied if they had to lose 
                                              cases before these judges because 
                                              they were more than convinced and 
                                              assured that justice would be done 
                                              or seen to be done at least when 
                                              finally judgment was delivered in 
                                              their cases. It is saddening to 
                                              note that three brilliant judges 
                                              of our beloved country who have 
                                              made singular contributions to the 
                                              advancement of the law should have 
                                              their careers cut short by 
                                              terrorists who cannot be said to 
                                              appreciate that the Ghanaian 
                                              society will certainly miss them. 
                                              The heinous crime that was 
                                              committed against them will 
                                              forever remain in the minds of 
                                              Ghanaians as the most dastardly 
                                              that had ever been perpetrated on 
                                              our land. It is in fact 
                                              unprecedented. Whatever decisions 
                                              they might have taken daring their 
                                              career as judges were taken in 
                                              furtherance of the enrichment of 
                                              the law through what might appear 
                                              to others to be a complex process 
                                              of interpretation.</span></p>

                                              It has been said in many quarters 
                                              that they were killed because of 
                                              certain judgments they had given 
                                              on certain controversial issues in 
                                              our legal system. We are inclined 
                                              to believe that this was what the 
                                              perpetrators of the heinous crime 
                                              would want us to believe and 
                                              accept as the truth. Who could be 
                                              said to have nursed such 
                                              grievances against them six months 
                                              after the accession into power of 
                                              the Government of the Provisional 
                                              National Defence Council to 
                                              warrant such an inhuman and 
                                              barbarous act as was said to have 
                                              been committed on or about 1 July 
                                              1982? That day certainly was the 
                                              darkest in the history of this 
                                              country.&nbsp; For, it is inconceivable 
                                              that innocent persons could 
                                              virtually be dragged out of their 
                                              various homes leaving their poor 
                                              wives, husband and children behind 
                                              only to meet their untimely death 
                                              at the hands of cold blooded 
                                              assassins who had no conscience.</span></p>

                                              It is worthy of note to recollect 
                                              that these three judges had great 
                                              concern for the deprived citizens 
                                              who appeared before them. One can 
                                              readily recall that Mr. Justice K. 
                                              A. Agyepong in 1977 took the 
                                              historic decision which led to the 
                                              release of most of the persons who 
                                              were detained under the regime of 
                                              the late Mr. Kutu Acheampong. 
                                              Several important decisions of 
                                              similar nature were taken by the 
                                              other judges which made anyone 
                                              regard them as having concern for 
                                              oppressed persons who appealed to 
                                              them for redress. It is our hope 
                                              that their departure from this 
                                              earth will inspire other persons 
                                              who have been left behind to 
                                              aspire towards more noble ideals 
                                              that will further the cause of 
                                              human advancement on this earth.</span></p>

                                              three judges for a considerable 
                                              length of time. With Fred, I had 
                                              worked for some time at the 
                                              Attorney-General's Department 
                                              before his appointment as a High 
                                              Court Judge. He was quiet and 
                                              pleasant person to work with who 
                                              considered his personal appearance 
                                              to be of prime importance to him. 
                                              The least said about Cecilia the 
                                              better, because her absence 
                                              reminds me of a great loss I have 
                                              incurred in my life. She was 
                                              affable and kindly, had time for 
                                              every person. She was prepared to 
                                              take on, sympathise and carry part 
                                              of everybody else's problems and 
                                              burdens. I got to know Kwadwo 
                                              Agyepong in 1970 when I was 
                                              transferred to Kumasi, and worked 
                                              with him at the Bar. One cannot 
                                              lose sight of the love, patience 
                                              and friendly attitude he exhibited 
                                              towards all at the Bar. The 
                                              departure of these illustrious 
                                              persons are indeed a great loss.</span></p>

                                              Major Sam Acquah has also played 
                                              in the reshaping of this country. 
                                              Until his untimely death, he was 
                                              the Director of Personnel at GIHOC, 
                                              and had been working in that 
                                              establishment since his retirement 
                                              from the Army. As an officer, he 
                                              was brilliant and was highly 
                                              commended during the regime of the 
                                              late Dr. Kwame Nkrumah. He served 
                                              with distinction as a military 
                                              intelligence officer after 
                                              receiving training in several 
                                              countries. Many army officers who 
                                              served under him would recall that 
                                              he was a disciplined man, honest 
                                              and very hardworking. He was very 
                                              loyal and very reliable. He worked 
                                              assiduously on any issue that was 
                                              referred to him, and could always 
                                              be expected to produce solutions 
                                              to the most intricate of problems. 
                                              By his death, Ghana has lost one 
                                              of her most patriotic sons who 
                                              still had so much to give towards 
                                              the further advancement of our 
                                              society. It was only last week, 
                                              Tuesday, that his appointment as 
                                              Managing Director of Bonsa Tyre 
                                              Company and Ghana Rubber Estates 
                                              Ltd. (formerly Firestone Ltd.) was 
                                              approved by the Committee of 
                                              P.N.D.C. Secretaries. His loss 
                                              will forever be felt by all who 
                                              had to deal with him when he was 
                                              alive. May he also rest in peace.</span></p>

                                              ahead of me and was my house 
                                              prefect in Balmer House. I shared 
                                              the same junior dormitory with 
                                              him. At Mfantsipim School in those 
                                              days, a person would not be

                                              prefect if his class work was not

                                              came in 1955 when I was in my last 
                                              year at the same college, and we 
                                              continued our friendship from 
                                              where we had left off. He was a

                                              of Inner Temple and after being

                                              The impression of my colleagues 
                                              about Mr. Justice Agyepong is that 
                                              he was capable, patient, 
                                              understanding and particularly 
                                              bold and hardworking. He very 
                                              often sat without a break from 
                                              10.00 a.m. to 4.00 p.m., provided 
                                              counsel agreed to stay. It is not 
                                              difficult for counsel to tell how 
                                              his mind was working because some 
                                              times at the stage of summons for 
                                              directions, he would ask counsel 
                                              whether he had considered the 
                                              decision of the Court of Appeal in 
                                              such and such a case. He often 
                                              turned his court into a tutorial 
                                              class when he was hearing a case 
                                              that involved an intricate or 
                                              novel proposition of law. All 
                                              counsel in the court would 
                                              contribute their views. This he 
                                              did in the interest of the 
                                              development of the law along the 
                                              correct lines. He was a Methodist 
                                              and took religion seriously. This, 
                                              according to him, enabled him to 
                                              have his vision clear and his 
                                              direction in life correct.</span></p>

                                              an efficient and capable 
                                              prosecutor. From there he was

                                              Mr. Justice Sarkodie was by nature

                                              friendly. During trials he asked 
                                              few questions or none at all and 
                                              counsel never knew how his mind 
                                              was working until he read his 
                                              judgment. As a judge, he was 
                                              hardworking, fair and firm. Few 
                                              lawyers or litigants, if any, 
                                              could complain genuinely about his 
                                              handling of cases or his 
                                              judgments. He was born and bred an 
                                              Anglican and I hasten to add a 
                                              practising Christian. He was the

                                              the letter and spirit of this

                                              be respected and adhered to. They 
                                              are justice and fair play, 
                                              abhorrence of arbitrariness and 
                                              discrimination; victimisation and 
                                              vindictiveness, the protection of 
                                              the individual and his fundamental 
                                              human rights within the walls of 
                                              the Constitution. We believe that 
                                              it was in pursuance of these 
                                              ideals that the framers of the 
                                              Constitution formulated their 
                                              proposals amongst which are 
                                              article 127(8) and (9) and which 
                                              were approved by the Constituent 
                                              Assembly. Conformably with these 
                                              ideals, the court finds both by 
                                              its letter and spirit that upon a 
                                              proper and true construction of 
                                              article 127(8) and (9), the Chief 
                                              Justice was amongst the class of 
                                              justices who were deemed to have 
                                              retained the various offices upon

                                              &quot;A written Constitution such as 
                                              ours is not an ordinary Act of 
                                              Parliament. It embodies the will 
                                              of a people. It also mirrors their 
                                              history. Account, therefore, needs

                                              a people's search for progress. It

                                              aspirations and their hopes for a 
                                              better, fuller life.</span></p>

                                              The Constitution has its letter of 
                                              the law. Equally, the Constitution 
                                              has its spirit. It is the 
                                              fountain-head for the authority 
                                              which each of the three arms of 
                                              government possesses and 
                                              exercises. It is a source of 
                                              strength. It is a source of power 
                                              . . . Its methods of alteration 
                                              are specified. In our peculiar 
                                              circumstances, those methods 
                                              require the involvement of the 
                                              whole body politic of Ghana. Its 
                                              language, therefore, must be 
                                              considered as if it were a living 
                                              organism capable of growth and 
                                              development . . . A broad and 
                                              liberal spirit is required for its 
                                              interpretation. It does not admit 
                                              of a narrow interpretation. A 
                                              doctrinaire approach to 
                                              interpretation would not do. We 
                                              must take account of its 
                                              principles and bring that 
                                              consideration to bear in bringing 
                                              it into conformity with the needs 
                                              of the time.&quot;</span></p>

                                              uphold a submission of no case.&nbsp; 
                                              In the result, this court has had 
                                              on many occasions to send the case 
                                              back to the justices for the

                                              justices should be guided by the

                                              The ground upon which a defendant 
                                              is called upon to open his case is 
                                              when, as earlier stated, the

                                              is referred to as a prima facie 
                                              case.&nbsp; In a nutshell, a prima 
                                              facie case means an allegation

                                              as to call for an answer from the 
                                              other party.&nbsp; In other words, it 
                                              is one which calls for an 
                                              investigation. We may here refer 
                                              to some definitions of prima facie 
                                              evidence.&nbsp; The Dictionary of 
                                              English Law defines it thus,4&nbsp;

                                              further to distinguish the literal

                                              evidence warrants an inference of

                                              towards deceased and followed him 
                                              up to his house. The deceased was 
                                              found dead the same night that 
                                              accused was alleged to have

                                              palms of the accused were found to

                                              the case from the jury. In my 
                                              opinion a prima&nbsp; facie case of

                                              is overruled and the accused is 
                                              called upon to make his defence to

                                              has closed its case, shows a prima

                                              law a higher standard of proof is 
                                              required in criminal cases than in 
                                              civil cases. But this is subject 
                                              to the qualification that there is 
                                              no absolute standard in either 
                                              case. In criminal cases the charge 
                                              must be proved beyond reasonable 
                                              doubt, but there may be degrees of 
                                              proof within that standard.</span></p>

                                              As Best C.J., and many other great 
                                              judges have said,&nbsp; ‘in proportion 
                                              as the crime is enormous, so ought 
                                              the proof to be clear’ ... a 
                                              reasonable doubt is simply that 
                                              degree of doubt which would 
                                              prevent a reasonable and just man 
                                              from coming to the conclusion. So 
                                              the phrase ‘reasonable doubt’ 
                                              takes the matter no further.&nbsp; It 
                                              does not say that the degree of 
                                              probability must be as high as 99 
                                              per cent or as low as 51 per 
                                              cent.&nbsp; The degree required must 
                                              depend on the mind of the 
                                              reasonable and just man who is 
                                              considering the particular 
                                              subject-matter.&nbsp; In some cases 51 
                                              per cent would be enough, but not 
                                              in others. When this is realized, 
                                              the phrase ‘reasonable doubt’ can 
                                              be used just as aptly in a civil 
                                              case ... as in a criminal case . . 
                                              . The only difference is that, 
                                              because of our high regard for the 
                                              liberty of the individual, a doubt 
                                              may be regarded as reasonable in 
                                              the criminal courts, which would 
                                              not be so in the civil courts.&quot;</span></p>

                                              the offence charged. For example,

                                              these essential ingredients of the

                                              statement made by myself when

                                              Court in Rex v. Joiner29 was not 
                                              followed by Lord Alverstone C.J., 
                                              in Rex v. Fraser.30 In that case 
                                              Lord Alverstone said: ‘Where an 
                                              objection is taken by counsel 
                                              unsuccessfully, and he then calls 
                                              evidence, this Court is not bound 
                                              to disregard the effect of that 
                                              evidence.' In Rex v. Pearson,31 
                                              where the conviction was quashed, 
                                              I said: ‘Of course, if admissions 
                                              by the defendant had supplied the 
                                              evidence that was wanting, we 
                                              should not have interfered with 
                                              the jury's verdict,’ and in Rex v. 
                                              George,32 Phillimore J. said: ‘As 
                                              the case proceeded to the end the 
                                              Court of Criminal Appeal are of 
                                              opinion that they ought to look at 
                                              the whole of the evidence.’ It is 
                                              true that in Rex v. Joiner, 
                                              Darling J., said: ‘If there was no 
                                              evidence’ (of the offence) ‘then 
                                              it was the duty of the Court to 
                                              withdraw the case from the jury.&nbsp; 
                                              We have no right to look and see 
                                              whether any evidence of larceny 
                                              was elicited after the close of 
                                              the case for the prosecution, when 
                                              counsel for the prisoner submitted 
                                              that there was no evidence to go 
                                              to the jury.’ At present the Court 
                                              is not prepared to follow Rex v. 
                                              Joiner, but prefers the reasoning 
                                              in the other two cases.’ This 
                                              Court agrees that Lord 
                                              Alverstone’s statement of the law 
                                              was accurate, and that the 
                                              judgment in Rex v. Joiner did not 
                                              put the matter rightly.&nbsp; It is 
                                              therefore impossible to quash the 
                                              conviction in this case on the 
                                              ground that the case for the 
                                              prosecution disclosed no evidence 
                                              against the appellant. As a result 
                                              of the evidence given by the other 
                                              defendant, there was a case 
                                              against the appellant. But the 
                                              conviction of the appellant must 
                                              be quashed on the ground that 
                                              there was misdirection and 
                                              non-direction by the Commissioner 
                                              in his summing-up. The defence 
                                              raised by the appellant was not 
                                              put to the jury.&quot;</span></p>

                                              The Ghanaian courts seem to have

                                              a distinction should be drawn

                                              to go to the jury. In the former

                                              the jury at the time of the 
                                              submission, the wrongful rejection 
                                              of the submission amounts to a 
                                              wrongful decision on a point of 
                                              law. This being so, the evidence 
                                              put in consequently was not part

                                              effectively precluded from 
                                              considering it and hence from

                                              accordance with section 19 (4) of 
                                              Act 372, the High Court is not 
                                              properly seised with jurisdiction 
                                              to entertain the appeal since 
                                              leave to appeal was not obtained 
                                              first from the district court or 
                                              from the High Court. And, in Yevu 
                                              v. The Republic53 it was held that 
                                              there was no right of appeal under 
                                              section 324 of Act 30 for an 
                                              interlocutory order. In the same 
                                              case it was held, obiter, that it 
                                              is doubtful whether the statutory 
                                              right of appeal from an 
                                              interlocutory decision or order 
                                              from a district court under 
                                              section 19 (4) of the Courts Act, 
                                              1971, includes the right of appeal 
                                              from the district court rejecting 
                                              a submission of no case after the 
                                              close of the prosecution's case; 
                                              since the resultant deluge of 
                                              cases, if it were so, would hold 
                                              up trials, create arrears by 
                                              impeding quick determination of 
                                              cases and it would be contrary to 
                                              judicial and public policy.&nbsp; And, 
                                              a High Court has recently held 
                                              that since virtually there is no 
                                              right of appeal against a ruling 
                                              of a submission of no case, an 
                                              application for leave to appeal 
                                              against such a ruling should not 
                                              be entertained by any court54.</span></p>

                                              It is true that interlocutory 
                                              matters apply to civil cases and 
                                              that the Criminal Procedure Code, 
                                              1960, is silent on them; yet as an 
                                              interlocutory matter implies a 
                                              matter incidental or ancillary to 
                                              a substantive suit which has not 
                                              been disposed of, by analogy a 
                                              submission of no case to answer 
                                              could be conveniently classified 
                                              as such; hence the need, following 
                                              the practice in civil cases, to 
                                              ask leave before appealing on its 
                                              rejection by the trial court.&nbsp; 
                                              However, it is submitted that the 
                                              accused should have the right to 
                                              appeal after a submission of no 
                                              case has been rejected, even if in 
                                              civil cases, such leave is 
                                              necessary.&nbsp; It is therefore 
                                              suggested that section 324 of Act 
                                              30, as amended by section 19(4) of 
                                              Act 372, should be further amended 
                                              to give the accused the right of 
                                              appealing after a rejection of no 
                                              case to answer as it is now done 
                                              when the whole evidence has been 
                                              given and the accused has been 
                                              convicted. </span></p>

                                              the court, following several 
                                              English authorities,57 held that

                                              truth.&nbsp; Its most objectionable 
                                              aspect has been largely abolished 
                                              in civil matters by judicial

                                              think but on the basis of what a 
                                              hypothetical jury might think, and

                                              The doctrine is one of choice, and 
                                              it enjoins that a defendant before 
                                              making a submission of no case 
                                              should state his position clearly 
                                              to the court whether or not he 
                                              would call evidence. If he 
                                              formally announces that he will 
                                              lead no evidence, a ruling or 
                                              judgment may be given against him 
                                              if his submission fails, just like 
                                              a defendant who abandons a suit 
                                              after the plaintiff has 
                                              successfully proved his case. 
                                              Where the defendant elects to call 
                                              evidence, the judgment or ruling 
                                              must be given only after he has 
                                              put his side of the case across to 
                                              the court. If he is not put to his 
                                              election at all he can still give 
                                              evidence as if no submission has 
                                              been made.61</span></p>

                                              At least two considerations 
                                              justify the requirement. In the 
                                              first place the judge sitting 
                                              alone, has to determine the facts 
                                              as well as the law, and he ought 
                                              not to be asked to express his 
                                              opinion until the case is 
                                              completed. Secondly, the parties 
                                              may be put to extra expense if the 
                                              judge ruled in favour of the 
                                              submission before the evidence was 
                                              complete, for if the Court of 
                                              Appeal were to decide against his 
                                              ruling, a new trial would be 
                                              necessary so that the party who 
                                              made the submission could call his 
                                              evidence.</span></p>

                                              In a civil case with a jury 
                                              neither of the above

                                              the judge has a discretion in such 
                                              cases, and he may rule on the 
                                              submission without putting the 
                                              party who makes it to his election

                                              Alexander v. Rayson between cases 
                                              tried by a judge alone and those 
                                              tried by a jury, there is this 
                                              further matter which I think of 
                                              some importance: in a case tried 
                                              by a judge alone the Court of 
                                              Appeal has a complete power of 
                                              rehearing, and if evidence for the 
                                              defendant has not been taken and 
                                              the court disagrees with the 
                                              ruling of the trial judge it is, 
                                              in effect, prevented from 
                                              exercising its power of rehearing 
                                              and has no alternative but to send 
                                              the case back for re-trial, which 
                                              will result in additional costs to 
                                              the parties.&nbsp; In cases of trial by 
                                              jury, the Court of Appeal has no 
                                              power of rehearing, and, if the 
                                              verdict of the jury is set aside 
                                              for any reason, the court has no 
                                              power except to send it back for 
                                              re-trial.&nbsp; Accordingly, it appears 
                                              to me that one of the advantages 
                                              which flows from a submission of 
                                              no case in a trial before a judge 
                                              alone does not arise in the case 
                                              of a trial by jury”. </span></p>

                                              that he had no case to answer, 
                                              namely (a) accepting the 
                                              plaintiff's evidence at its face

                                              established in law and (b) the 
                                              evidence led for the plaintiff was 
                                              so unsatisfactory or unreliable 
                                              that the court should find that 
                                              the burden of proof had not been 
                                              discharged.&nbsp; Where the submission 
                                              was based on the former ground, 
                                              the defendant would be bound by 
                                              his election not to call further 
                                              evidence and no new trial would be 
                                              ordered where the ruling was upset 
                                              on appeal. However, if it were 
                                              based on the latter ground, the 
                                              appellate court might, as in the 
                                              instant case, decide the case 
                                              without sending it back; but in 
                                              other cases, it might find itself 
                                              unable to come to a just 
                                              conclusion on the findings of the 
                                              court below; in which case the

                                              without calling evidence. If the 
                                              judge or magistrate overruled the 
                                              submission, judgment would then be 
                                              entered for the plaintiffs. 
                                              However, a submission of no case 
                                              ipso facto did not mean that 
                                              counsel would lose his right to 
                                              call evidence if his submission 
                                              failed, he would only lose the 
                                              right if he definitely elected not 
                                              to call evidence. The practice, 
                                              however, amounted to no more than 
                                              a direction to the judge to put 
                                              counsel who desired to make a 
                                              submission of no case to his 
                                              election and to refuse to rule 
                                              unless he elected to call no 
                                              evidence. Consequently, if through 
                                              oversight or misapprehension as to 
                                              the nature of counsels argument, 
                                              the judge did not put counsel to 
                                              his election and counsel did not 
                                              expressly or impliedly elect, 
                                              counsel would be entitled to call 
                                              his evidence just as if he had 
                                              never made the submission. Since 
                                              the defendant had not been put on 
                                              his election, the trial magistrate 
                                              was entirely wrong when by his 
                                              ruling on the submission of no 
                                              case, he denied to the defendant 
                                              his right to call evidence.</span></p>

                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
                                              <span style="font-family: Arial">
                                              In both criminal and civil cases, 
                                              it is submitted, there should be 
                                              no fetters on submission of no 
                                              case to answer; provided the 
                                              circumstances demand it. 
                                              Discretion of the judge, 
                                              notwithstanding, one party should 
                                              have the right to submit no case 
                                              and the other the right to reply.&nbsp; 
                                              This dual right of parties should 
                                              be allowed to operate whether the 
                                              case is being tried summarily or 
                                              on indictment and irrespective of 
                                              the personalities involved.&nbsp; The 
                                              doctrine of election in civil 
                                              cases should be abolished.&nbsp; Where 
                                              a court overrules a submission of 
                                              no case it is desirable that 
                                              reasons for doing so are given.&nbsp; 
                                              Although an appeal could be taken 
                                              by a party or his counsel at this 
                                              stage of the trial, it should be 
                                              resorted to rarely and only where 
                                              subsequent evidence by the defence 
                                              could seriously be adverse to 
                                              him.&nbsp; However, the fact that a 
                                              submission was overruled should be 
                                              one of the grounds of appeal if 
                                              the party feels the court did so 
                                              wrongfully. Finally, counsel 
                                              should be wary in making a 
                                              submission of no case and should 
                                              attempt it only where there is 
                                              ample chance of success. It should 
                                              not be routine; for where it 
                                              fails, it weakens not only what 
                                              might be a brilliant address at 
                                              the end of the whole evidence but 
                                              might subtly prejudice a party's 
                                              case, particularly where it is 
                                              being tried with a jury.</span></p>
