                                              The law is quite clear that 
                                              criticism of the court and of 
                                              judicial decisions, however 
                                              rumbustious, whether or not in 
                                              good taste, and despite its 
                                              inaccurate statement of fact, is 
                                              not a contempt of court but is 
                                              within the limits of the 
                                              inalienable right of every 
                                              individual to freedom of speech: 
                                              see R. v. Commissioner of Police 
                                              of the Metropolis;. Ex parte 
                                              Blackburn.1 Thus the law 
                                              recognises the right of a person 
                                              to criticise the judgment of our 
                                              judges provided the criticism is 
                                              fair and made in good faith.</span></p>

                                              But what is the position where a 
                                              critic goes beyond the bounds of 
                                              fair criticism and comments on the 
                                              decisions of courts or where a 
                                              litigant in his pleadings refers 
                                              to irrelevant matters which tend 
                                              to scandalise the courts and 
                                              judges generally and bring into 
                                              contempt, the machinery and 
                                              administration of justice itself? 
                                              The answer was given by the 
                                              Supreme Court in Bilson v. 
                                              Apaloo,2 in its judgment delivered 
                                              on 8 May 1981. After holding, 
                                              inter alia, that there was no 
                                              justification or substance

                                              serious judicial impropriety, 
                                              bias, and pre-judgment levelled 
                                              against the five justices who had 
                                              heard and determined the case of

                                              unsavoury aspects of the case. 
                                              While learned counsel for the 
                                              plaintiff properly confined his 
                                              oral arguments to the above issues 
                                              of law, unfortunately his 
                                              pleadings extended beyond them and 
                                              raised completely irrelevant 
                                              matters which tended to scandalise 
                                              the courts and judges generally 
                                              and to bring into contempt the 
                                              machinery and administration of 
                                              justice itself.</span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

                                              Worse still, it was disclosed in 
                                              the statement of defence and 
                                              admitted by the plaintiff in his 
                                              reply that prior to the hearing of 
                                              the case in this court, a press 
                                              conference was launched by the 
                                              plaintiff in Accra on 4 February 
                                              1981 whereat, it is alleged, 
                                              utterances were made tending to 
                                              defame not only the defendant but 
                                              other judges as well. Mercifully, 
                                              learned counsel for the plaintiff 
                                              thought the better of his client's 
                                              pre-trial public utterances and 
                                              newspaper advertisements and 
                                              steered clear of them in 
                                              presenting his legal arguments. He 
                                              is to be commanded for his 
                                              restraint. There was consequently 
                                              no opportunity for the defendant's 
                                              counsel to advert to these 
                                              extraneous but serious matters, 
                                              which tend to scandalise the 
                                              courts and judges and destroy the

                                              administration of justice. 
                                              Publications imputing bias and 
                                              improper motives to judges are 
                                              regarded as contempt and are duly 
                                              punished. This court will in 
                                              future not hesitate to exercise 
                                              its undoubted constitutional

                                              This warning is, however, not 
                                              intended to stifle legitimate and 
                                              reasoned criticism of a judgment 
                                              in any case or of the 
                                              administration of justice 
                                              generally; for we acknowledge the 
                                              legitimacy and indeed the need for 
                                              reasoned criticism in a democracy. 
                                              If such criticism is informed, 
                                              pertinent, fair and not malicious, 
                                              it can only assist us in improving 
                                              on our methods and in improving 
                                              the administration of justice. 
                                              Obviously, reasoned criticism of 
                                              judgment made in good faith is in 
                                              the public interest; but 
                                              scurrilous abuse and the 
                                              unwarranted imputations of bias 
                                              and improper motives to judges are 
                                              not conducive to the public good 
                                              but can only destroy the public 
                                              confidence in the judiciary and in 
                                              the administration of justice 
                                              generally. We cannot condemn it 
                                              too strongly. We fully endorse 
                                              Lord Denning M.R.'s wise dicta on 
                                              reasoned criticism of judges and

                                              We do not fear criticism, nor do 
                                              we resent it. For there is 
                                              something far more important at 
                                              stake. It is no less than freedom

                                              It is the right of every man, in 
                                              Parliament or out of it, in the 
                                              Press or over the broadcast, to 
                                              make fair comment, even out-spoken 
                                              comment, on matters of public 
                                              interest. Those who comment can 
                                              deal faithfully with all that is 
                                              done in a court of justice. They 
                                              can say that we are mistaken, and 
                                              our decisions erroneous, whether 
                                              they are subject to appeal or not. 
                                              All we would ask is that those who 
                                              criticise us will remember that, 
                                              from the nature of our office, we 
                                              cannot reply to their criticisms. 
                                              We cannot enter into public 
                                              controversy. Still less into 
                                              political controversy. We must 
                                              rely on our conduct itself to be 
                                              its own vindication&quot;.</span></p>

                                              The Supreme Court must be 
                                              commended for making it plain its 
                                              attitude to criticisms levelled

                                              It is hoped that the judges in 
                                              Ghana would accept criticisms of

                                              faith.</span></p>
