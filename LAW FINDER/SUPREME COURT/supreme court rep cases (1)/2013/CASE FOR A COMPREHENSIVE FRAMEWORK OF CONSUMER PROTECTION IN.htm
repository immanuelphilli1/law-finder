                                              IN an earlier contribution,1 the 
                                              present writer drew attention to 
                                              the acute shortage of consumer 
                                              goods which has led to high prices 
                                              in the markets.&nbsp; The current 
                                              shortages have enabled traders to 
                                              sell essential commodities at the 
                                              non-controlled prices as can be 
                                              evidenced from the prices of goods 
                                              on the markets.&nbsp; The fact that 
                                              unfair trading practices still 
                                              persist as is evidenced by high 
                                              prices and arrests for hoarding 
                                              and profiteering cases can only 
                                              demonstrate that resort to law to 
                                              curb rising prices has had only a 
                                              marginal impact. The question is 
                                              whether, and to what extent, the 
                                              law can protect the consumer in 
                                              current Ghanaian circumstances.</span></p>

                                              The law and practice of consumer 
                                              protection in Ghana is hardly 
                                              developed and may be said to be in 
                                              an unsatisfactory state.&nbsp; Its 
                                              future is contingent upon the 
                                              development of controlled trading 
                                              in the country. Previous attempts 
                                              to enhance consumer protection 
                                              have been half-hearted, and it 
                                              remains uncertain whether recent 
                                              attempts to encourage 
                                              &quot;consumerism&quot;2 will ensure a high 
                                              level of consumer protection.</span></p>

                                              The process of economic change in 
                                              Ghana has brought a considerable 
                                              increase in the proportion of 
                                              people who now depend upon others 
                                              in order to obtain their consumer 
                                              requirements.&nbsp; In other words, the 
                                              market dependence of consumers has 
                                              increased, and one of the problems 
                                              that has arisen as a result has 
                                              been that consumers have now come 
                                              to stand in need of legal 
                                              protection in connection with 
                                              their consumer sale contracts.3&nbsp; 
                                              Especially is this so with regard 
                                              to the legal regulation of 
                                              prices.&nbsp; It may be argued that 
                                              unfair trading practices such as 
                                              hoarding and profiteering have 
                                              been in existence even before the 
                                              termination of colonial rule.&nbsp; As 
                                              long ago as 1938, the shortage of 
                                              some commodities such as sugar, 
                                              flour and cutlasses led to high

                                              &quot;The effect was made worse by a 
                                              system of petty retail trade which 
                                              exaggerated the rise. Thus the 
                                              price of sugar in the main stores 
                                              was now 8d. a 1b, . . . but when 
                                              sold a cube by cube on the small 
                                              wayside stalls it was 3s.; the 
                                              price of imported tinned fish and 
                                              meat, candles, matches, and 
                                              cigarettes was similarly inflated 
                                              by a local system of multiple 
                                              retail trade.&quot;</span></p>

                                              The shortages enabled the market 
                                              forces of supply and demand to 
                                              have free play. The colonial 
                                              administration resorted to the law 
                                              to keep prices within limits. It 
                                              passed the Control of Prices 
                                              Regulations in 19495 which forbade 
                                              traders to sell their wares at the 
                                              non-controlled prices. Since then, 
                                              successive governments have been 
                                              using the law as the main 
                                              mechanism to keep prices within 
                                              limits.6 One regrettable result of 
                                              the shortages has been that 
                                              consumers willingly give away the 
                                              protection that the law would 
                                              otherwise accord them. Personal 
                                              experience and life in, and among 
                                              the Ghanaian people, reveal that 
                                              traders sell consumer goods to 
                                              known customers who would not 
                                              report them to the law enforcement 
                                              agents.&nbsp; Again, personal 
                                              experience and the number of cases 
                                              which have come up for resolution 
                                              in the courts provide a reliable 
                                              support for the claim that the 
                                              proportion of complainants who are 
                                              prepared to enforce their rights 
                                              is very small. This encourages 
                                              traders to assume that they can 
                                              sell their goods at exorbitant 
                                              prices with impunity and get away 
                                              with it.&nbsp; Such an assumption on 
                                              the part of dishonest traders does 
                                              not only reduce the protection the 
                                              law seeks to accord the consumer, 
                                              but also the practice is unfair to 
                                              the honest trader who endeavours 
                                              to maintain high standards and 
                                              has, at the same time, to compete 
                                              with the dishonest traders 
                                              operating in the consumer trade.&nbsp; 
                                              Accordingly, successive 
                                              legislatures have resorted to the 
                                              sanctions of the criminal law in 
                                              its search for control.&nbsp; First, 
                                              the legislature's resort to the 
                                              criminal law is to protect 
                                              consumers by ensuring that they 
                                              buy their consumer goods at the 
                                              controlled prices. Secondly, the 
                                              use of the criminal law ensures 
                                              that the expensive and 
                                              time-consuming process of 
                                              discharging the dishonest trader 
                                              is entrusted to public servants 
                                              whose duty it is to enforce price 
                                              control regulations. If the 
                                              provisions of the criminal law can 
                                              enable the consumer to obtain full 
                                              compensation, it will be 
                                              unnecessary for him to rely on the 
                                              civil law remedies: they will be 
                                              superfluous.&nbsp; But above all, the 
                                              resort to criminal sanctions is to 
                                              squash unfair practices before 
                                              they mushroom. Sad to say, this 
                                              effect has not been achieved yet.

                                              further trading in that market for 
                                              a period of twelve months. This 
                                              fair trading provision seeks to 
                                              eliminate dishonest traders from 
                                              the consumer sale business, 
                                              thereby allowing the more 
                                              law-abiding traders to operate.</span></p>

                                              Section 6 makes it an offence to 
                                              hoard goods, and the prescribed 
                                              punishment is imprisonment for a

                                              to hoarding in the context of the 
                                              Decree.&nbsp; These instances include 
                                              keeping of goods in excess of 
                                              one's immediate requirements, or 
                                              in a manner likely to cause a 
                                              shortage.7 Personal observation 
                                              and life among the Ghanaian 
                                              trading community demonstrate that 
                                              very often a trader would refuse 
                                              to treat on the sole ground that 
                                              the owner of the goods exposed to 
                                              the view of the consuming and 
                                              buying public is not present.&nbsp; 
                                              Consequently, the Decree, by its 
                                              section 7 makes this unfair 
                                              trading practice an offence which 
                                              can be punishable by mandatory 
                                              imprisonment.&nbsp; Section 8 gives

                                              officers in uniform to take 
                                              possession of goods which a trader 
                                              is unreasonably refraining from 
                                              selling to a consumer-buyer who 
                                              needs them. Such goods, if seized, 
                                              may be sold to the public by any

                                              Inspector-General of Police or 
                                              regional secretary, and the 
                                              proceeds of sale are to be 
                                              forfeited to the Republic unless 
                                              the Inspector-General of Police or 
                                              a regional secretary otherwise 
                                              directs.&nbsp; It is also an offence to 
                                              smuggle out of Ghana goods 
                                              specified in the schedule to the 
                                              Decree.&nbsp; Those include tinned 
                                              foods, rice, sugar, milk, flour, 
                                              soap, matchets, textiles.&nbsp; The 
                                              penalty is imprisonment for a term 
                                              of not less than three months and 
                                              not more than ten years without 
                                              the option of a fine.&nbsp; The goods 
                                              concerned are to be automatically 
                                              forfeited and the vehicle may also 
                                              be forfeited.8 Where a juvenile 
                                              under seventeen years does any act 
                                              in contravention of section 1, his 
                                              parent or guardian or the owner of 
                                              the goods shall be deemed to have 
                                              committed the offence. It will be 
                                              no defence to say that the act of 
                                              the juvenile was unauthorised.9 
                                              Section 12 provides that the 
                                              trading, consuming and buying 
                                              public are entitled to complain to 
                                              any police officer of any 
                                              contravention of a price control 
                                              order or any instance of hoarding 
                                              or smuggling. The law places on 
                                              the police officer a statutory 
                                              duty to investigate immediately 
                                              and take steps to prosecute the 
                                              offender. This provision seeks to 
                                              squash high prices before they 
                                              mushroom. If suppliers are 
                                              reported and disciplined, it will 
                                              scare other suppliers to mend 
                                              their ways. Section 13 gives the 
                                              usual related powers of entry, 
                                              inspection, production of 
                                              documents and seizure. Section 14 
                                              makes it an offence to obstruct or 
                                              insult an inspector or fail to 
                                              comply with his lawful requests.</span></p>

                                              It will have been noted that the 
                                              Price Control Decree, 1974,10 
                                              sought not only to enable 
                                              consumers and buyers to buy at the 
                                              controlled prices, but also, to 
                                              prevent dishonest traders from 
                                              trading altogether. It was an 
                                              ambitious penal legislation that 
                                              purported to curtail unfair 
                                              trading practices in the country. 
                                              The question is whether or not the

                                              The nature of the compensation 
                                              under the Price Control Decree, 
                                              1974, is nothing more than a 
                                              windfall to the consumer-buyer who 
                                              complains about profiteering at 
                                              his expense, and whose &quot;assailant&quot;

                                              remedy. It even boggles the mind 
                                              that a consumer-buyer who has

                                              the controlled price or from a

                                              of little value to the

                                              this. What he needs is a full 
                                              legal protection such that he can 
                                              obtain his consumer requirements

                                              products. Above all, in current, 
                                              Ghanaian circumstances, what the 
                                              consumer really needs is a system 
                                              whereby dishonest traders can be 
                                              legally restrained from trading 
                                              altogether unless and until they 
                                              mend their ways. The provisions of 
                                              the Price Control Decree, 1974, 
                                              seek to achieve this as is 
                                              evidenced by section 
                                              5(1),(2)(a)-(c) and (3). But by 
                                              themselves, the provisions are not 
                                              enough.&nbsp; Personal observation and 
                                              the current Ghanaian experience 
                                              show that traders can always adopt 
                                              new practices to sidestep the law. 
                                              For instance, personal experience 
                                              reveals that some traders fill up 
                                              large enamel bowls with goods and 
                                              cover them with garri to escape 
                                              discovery. Others pretend that 
                                              they sell crabs when in actual 
                                              fact they have concealed pilchards 
                                              in the bowls.13&nbsp; It is, therefore, 
                                              necessary for the law to find 
                                              devices to curb such trade 
                                              malpractices and unfair trading

                                              regulations has been to enable the 
                                              consumer-buyer obtain his 
                                              requirements at the controlled 
                                              prices, clearly it has not proved 
                                              to be so as is evidenced by the 
                                              current prices in the local 
                                              markets and small kiosks of petty 
                                              traders from whom the majority of

                                              Further, the Price Control Orders 
                                              have not enabled the 
                                              consumer-buyer to obtain 
                                              compensation in the event of a 
                                              breach of consumer sale because 
                                              the Price Control Decree did not 
                                              create a right to compensation.&nbsp; 
                                              Only a refund of a sum equal to 
                                              the excess profit or double the 
                                              price charged can be obtained, but 
                                              even then only upon the conviction 
                                              of the seller and by order of the 
                                              court.</span></p>

                                              so far, in theory, do a great deal

                                              criminal law, there is also the 
                                              civil law through the law of sale 
                                              of goods and contract which 
                                              attempts to assist the 
                                              consumer-buyer in his consumer 
                                              transactions with traders.&nbsp; For 
                                              instance, the Sale of Goods Act, 
                                              1962,14 imposes certain

                                              suppliers of goods. It further

                                              cut down implied conditions as to

                                              Furthermore, the civil law

                                              a consumer sale.17 Unfortunately, 
                                              the Sale of Goods Act, 1962, was 
                                              drafted before the explosion of 
                                              the current problems which the 
                                              consumer now&nbsp; faces as a result of 
                                              chronic shortages which have led 
                                              to improvident bargains and supply 
                                              of shoddy goods. The language of 
                                              the Sale of Goods Act, 1962, 
                                              regarding for instance, the 
                                              condition of quality and fitness, 
                                              fundamental obligation of seller 
                                              and buyer as well as remedies of 
                                              seller and buyer is more 
                                              appropriate to a contract between 
                                              two businessmen than to a&nbsp; 
                                              contract between a businessman and 
                                              a consumer. This is most evident 
                                              in the remedy the law seeks to 
                                              provide the consumer where there 
                                              has been a breach of either a 
                                              condition or warranty on the part 
                                              of the seller or supplier of 
                                              goods. Under the present Ghanaian 
                                              circumstances, the remedies which 
                                              the consumer-buyer most wants are 
                                              a right to have the defective 
                                              goods replaced or repaired by the 
                                              seller, but this is not provided 
                                              for by the Sale of Goods Act, 
                                              1962.&nbsp; In Ghana, as life among the 
                                              trading community vividly shows, 
                                              the policy to refund is a matter 
                                              of business practice; there does 
                                              not appear to be any legal right 
                                              to have the goods repaired or 
                                              replaced.&nbsp; The language of section 
                                              49(1) purports to enable the 
                                              consumer to get his money back in 
                                              at least three cases specified in 
                                              that section.&nbsp; But this protection 
                                              would seem to be in respect of 
                                              bulk purchases—in fact, by a 
                                              businessman, not a consumer. Even 
                                              then, section 51(1) reduces this 
                                              protection.&nbsp; It provides, &quot;The 
                                              buyer may not reject goods which 
                                              he has accepted.&quot; Section 52 then 
                                              specifies three types of 
                                              acceptance.&nbsp; It provides:</span></p>

                                              This section raises a further 
                                              unsettled point in our consumer 
                                              law. Clearly, the section does not 
                                              purport to deal with consumer 
                                              sales which are the concern of 
                                              this contribution.&nbsp; The section is 
                                              clearly dealing with bulk sales 
                                              between businessmen and not for 
                                              instance, between a consumer-buyer 
                                              and a seller. Finally, although 
                                              section 53 purports to enable the 
                                              consumer-buyer to maintain an 
                                              action for damages against the 
                                              seller for non-delivery, this is 
                                              yet another area which is of 
                                              little importance to the 
                                              consumer-buyer, the sole ground 
                                              for this view is that the

                                              It is clear, therefore, that

                                              Unfortunately, the draftsman did 
                                              not make his intention clearer. It 
                                              can be argued that the provision 
                                              purports to confer a benefit on 
                                              consumers who cannot establish a 
                                              privity relationship with the 
                                              seller. But since this intention 
                                              is not clearly expressed, it would 
                                              appear that strict intention of a 
                                              conferment of benefit will be 
                                              insisted upon.&nbsp; Professor Date-Bah 
                                              has observed that the phrase &quot; any 
                                              provision &quot; is used synonymously 
                                              in the Act with the phrase &quot;any 
                                              term.&quot;21 He concludes that the 
                                              Ghanaian Law &quot;recognises a ius 
                                              quaesitum tertio arising by way of 
                                              contract, where there is an 
                                              intention to confer a benefit on a 
                                              third party.22&nbsp; This observation 
                                              would seem to take account of 
                                              difficulties which occasionally 
                                              arise in ascertaining whether a 
                                              contract, for example, for a meal 
                                              supplied at a restaurant, is made 
                                              with a husband, or his wife, or 
                                              both. This provision can 
                                              effectively be of utility to the 
                                              consuming and buying public if it 
                                              is re-written to take account of 
                                              consumers who would not be able to 
                                              establish any privity relationship 
                                              with the seller.</span></p>

                                              or aggrieved consumer, our

                                              varying terms of imprisonment, 
                                              show that, occasionally, an 
                                              appropriate sanction is visited on 
                                              persistent offenders against the 
                                              price control law.&nbsp; Thus in 
                                              Republic v. Asiedu the accused was 
                                              fined ¢100 or six months' 
                                              imprisonment. She paid the fine.&nbsp; 
                                              She had failed to mark the price 
                                              of mosquito coils which she sold 
                                              contrary to section 2 (1) and (4) 
                                              of the Price Control Regulations, 
                                              1976 (L.I. 1068). The accused in 
                                              Republic v. Aduhene was fined ¢500 
                                              or in default six months' 
                                              imprisonment.&nbsp; She paid the fine.&nbsp; 
                                              She had increased the price of 
                                              pepsi cola from 70p. to 80p. 
                                              without the prior consent of the 
                                              Prices and Incomes Board contrary 
                                              to sections 1 (2) and 5 (1) of the 
                                              Prices and Incomes Regulations, 
                                              thus making an illegal profit of 
                                              10p.&nbsp; In Republic v. Ntim, the 
                                              accused increased the price of 
                                              some goods without the prior 
                                              consent in writing of the Prices 
                                              and Incomes Board contrary to 
                                              sections 1(2) and 5(1) of the 
                                              Prices and Incomes Regulations, 
                                              1973 (L.I. 805). She paid the fine 
                                              of ¢1,500 imposed by the court. 
                                              Similarly, in Republic v. Abena, 
                                              the court fined the traders ¢150 
                                              each or three months' imprisonment 
                                              in default, for failing to mark 
                                              the price on a set of pyrex bowls 
                                              they were selling. Predictably, 
                                              they paid the fine. So did the 
                                              accused in Republic v. Boye, who 
                                              was fined ¢300 or a day's 
                                              imprisonment for increasing the 
                                              prices of goods without the prior 
                                              consent in writing of the Prices 
                                              and Incomes Board.&nbsp; The accused in 
                                              Republic v. Sowah who sold a cake 
                                              of guardian for ¢3 instead of 85p. 
                                              was sentenced to a month's 
                                              imprisonment.&nbsp; In Republic v. 
                                              Afenu, and in Republic v. Opoku, 
                                              the accused persons both received 
                                              a month's imprisonment sentence 
                                              each for selling goods above the 
                                              controlled price.&nbsp; Both of them 
                                              were, in addition, ordered to 
                                              refund twice the illegal profit to 
                                              the buyers, or in default two 
                                              months' imprisonment. Although the 
                                              cases cited show that the law 
                                              seems to ensure that appropriate 
                                              sanction is visited on offenders, 
                                              yet they represent the tip of the 
                                              iceberg.&nbsp; In seeking to observe 
                                              and enforce the observance of the 
                                              price control laws and orders, the 
                                              courts have not been active 
                                              enough.&nbsp; Rather they appear to be 
                                              lenient with some of the traders. 
                                              Some of the scales of punishment 
                                              have not been a deterrent.&nbsp; As was 
                                              observed by the Abraham 
                                              Commission32:</span></p>

                                              In any case, the fines imposed are

                                              The cases cited in which the court 
                                              imposed fines on the wrongdoers 
                                              illustrate our assertion. &nbsp;We have 
                                              already discussed a few of the 
                                              reported cases that went on appeal 
                                              in the high courts.33 These cases, 
                                              except Acquah v. The Republic,34 
                                              are illustrative of the 
                                              anti-consumer protection attitude 
                                              of some of our judges.</span></p>

                                              It has already been stated that 
                                              the decision in Acquah v. The 
                                              Republic35 seems both technically 
                                              correct and practically 
                                              convenient. The reason for this 
                                              view is that the decisions in the 
                                              other cases noted36 would inhibit 
                                              consumer-protection.&nbsp; There is, 
                                              therefore, clearly much to be said 
                                              for the actual result arrived at 
                                              in this case. It is obviously 
                                              desirable that suppliers of 
                                              consumer goods should sell 
                                              according to the spirit of the 
                                              existing price control laws.&nbsp; 
                                              There seems no good reason why 
                                              their activities should not be 
                                              checked by the courts.&nbsp; On this 
                                              note, it is useful to mention that 
                                              the decisions in Adom v. The 
                                              Republic,37 Republic v. Dufa38 and 
                                              Osei v. The Republic39 must not&nbsp; 
                                              be followed. In general, these 
                                              cases have shown that the courts 
                                              have displayed no very favourable 
                                              attitude towards the consumer. 
                                              Some of the decisions have rather 
                                              construed the protection away.&nbsp; It 
                                              will be hardly surprising if some 
                                              consumers decide to abandon the 
                                              courts. But there is still some 
                                              hope for the consumer.&nbsp; Certainly 
                                              the last word has not been said.&nbsp; 
                                              And one may hazard the guess that 
                                              the glare of public agitation and 
                                              the threat or actual enactment of 
                                              corrective legislation will have 
                                              some effect of inducing our judges 
                                              to modify their anti-consumer 
                                              protection attitude.&nbsp; To this 
                                              extent, it can be asserted that 
                                              the law has not vigorously ensured 
                                              that appropriate sanction is 
                                              visited on offenders.&nbsp; Thus, it 
                                              has not effectively protected the 
                                              consuming and buying public.

                                              provided an appropriate remedy for 
                                              consumers who have been injured as 
                                              a result of using or consuming 
                                              defective products. For instance, 
                                              the plaintiffs in Aboagye v. 
                                              Kumasi Brewery Limited40 and

                                              Ltd.41 were awarded compensation

                                              manufactured by the defendants. 
                                              Although the illustrative cases 
                                              are scanty, they amply demonstrate 
                                              that in some cases the law has 
                                              provided an appropriate tort-based 
                                              remedy for injured consumers. 
                                              Judged by this notion of 
                                              effectiveness, the law has 
                                              protected the consumer-buyer in

                                              considered the extent to which the

                                              defective.&nbsp; We have seen that, as 
                                              can be evidenced by life among the 
                                              Ghanaian trading public, as a 
                                              result of the persistence of 
                                              unfair trading practices, such as 
                                              hoarding and profiteering, the

                                              policy-makers must bring some

                                              consumer-protection legislation in 
                                              our statute book.&nbsp; Legislation is 
                                              called for to protect the varied

                                              this new legislation should take 
                                              the form of a comprehensive 
                                              consumer-protection dealing with 
                                              all the main issues discussed in

                                              separately, is not a question that

                                              Decree, 1974,42 Contracts Act, 
                                              1960,43 and Sale of Goods Act, 
                                              1962,44 which purport to deal with 
                                              consumer transactions. On the

                                              on the legislature and the length

                                              probably make it easier to pass

                                              Again, there could be a provision

                                              refund. It should be emphasised 
                                              that the consumer or buyer is not 
                                              interested in getting damages but

                                              there is need for an agency that

                                              consumer complaints.&nbsp; In addition, 
                                              these officers can seek voluntary 
                                              compliance by educating the 
                                              selling community on the need to 
                                              comply with consumer-protection 
                                              legislation.&nbsp; They can also issue 
                                              legally binding &quot;cease and desist 
                                              orders&quot; against dishonest 
                                              traders.50 Our known experiences 
                                              indicate that it is only if a 
                                              consumer agency takes an active 
                                              role in seeking out improvident 
                                              and harsh consumer bargains that 
                                              the consumer will be able to voice 
                                              an effective complaint.&nbsp; In turn, 
                                              this agency is likely to be a 
                                              watchdog of consumer interests.&nbsp; 
                                              Any information to be collected, 
                                              too, by the agency will provide 
                                              more data on consumer problem 
                                              solving.&nbsp; This is likely to 
                                              provide a basis for a systematic 
                                              surveillance of the market-place.

                                              Another area which needs a 
                                              recasting is the courts.&nbsp; Since 
                                              consumer disputes in this country 
                                              involve small claims, we need to 
                                              provide a machinery different in 
                                              procedure from other varieties of 
                                              civil litigation. We suggest the 
                                              creation of &quot;market courts&quot; that 
                                              will be active, such as the type 
                                              in Sweden.</span></p>

                                              The real purpose of such a 
                                              provision is the expeditious and 
                                              inexpensive resolution of many of 
                                              those consumer grievances that now 
                                              fall outside the practical ambit 
                                              of the ordinary courts.&nbsp; Afterall, 
                                              few consumers are willing to 
                                              litigate their disputes in the 
                                              ordinary courts. As has been 
                                              stated already, a factor which 
                                              affects a consumer in ventilating 
                                              his grievances is financial costs. 
                                              Thus, if market courts are 
                                              established, the law would in 
                                              particular, discourage or prohibit 
                                              the use of legal representation.&nbsp; 
                                              In addition, our proposed law 
                                              would seek to simplify court 
                                              procedure by the introduction of a 
                                              less formal and speedier method of 
                                              adjudication. Since most consumers 
                                              will not want to go to court even 
                                              if the legal impediments are 
                                              removed; because they will pay 
                                              costs if they lose,&nbsp; our law would 
                                              contain a provision that where, 
                                              for instance, the claim will not 
                                              exceed ¢200, no costs should be 
                                              recoverable by either party 
                                              (except the cost of issuing the 
                                              summons). The purpose of this 
                                              proposal lies in the fact that it 
                                              will reduce the possible risk that 
                                              an unsuccessful small claimant 
                                              would have to pay the other side's 
                                              costs, as well as encourage more 
                                              litigation, although it would also 
                                              mean that the small claimant's 
                                              victory could be pyrrhic if the 
                                              costs are more than the value of 
                                              the consumer sale.&nbsp; Such a court, 
                                              should not wait till cases come to 
                                              them.&nbsp; Provisions should be made 
                                              to enable their officials ferret 
                                              out offences against the law for 
                                              resolution in the market courts. 
                                              This means that our law would 
                                              contain provisions that would give 
                                              the usual related powers of 
                                              purchase, entry and seizure, 
                                              testing and prosecution to the 
                                              consumer ombudsman and his staff 
                                              in aggregate as well as officials 
                                              of the market courts. Afterall 
                                              &quot;The enjoyment of traditional as 
                                              well as new social rights

                                              effective protection.&nbsp; Such 
                                              protection, moreover, is best 
                                              assured by a workable remedy 
                                              within the framework of the 
                                              judicial system.&quot;51</span></p>

                                              Again, our law would contain a 
                                              provision that would require the 
                                              consumer ombudsman to prohibit 
                                              persistently dishonest traders 
                                              from trading altogether. Our known
