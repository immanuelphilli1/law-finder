                                              application in Adjei v. Foriwaa1 
                                              discussed important principles in 
                                              the Akan customary law of 
                                              marriage. It arose from events 
                                              both tortuous and rancorous. The 
                                              plaintiff was the customary-law 
                                              wife of the defendant, by whom she 
                                              had six children.</span></p>

                                              deteriorated, and the defendant 
                                              married another woman. The 
                                              plaintiff brought an action 
                                              claiming, as far as is relevant, a 
                                              declaration that a certain house 
                                              was the parties' joint property 
                                              and their matrimonial home, an 
                                              order for maintenance for herself 
                                              and the children and an injunction 
                                              restraining the defendant from 
                                              ejecting her from the house. The 
                                              defendant himself initiated 
                                              proceedings against the plaintiff 
                                              and her parents for an order to

                                              marriage customarily, or 
                                              alternatively an order of 
                                              dissolution, and an order ejecting 
                                              the plaintiff from the house. As a 
                                              result of the defendant's 
                                              proceedings the plaintiff and her 
                                              children were ejected under an

                                              two actions were consolidated, and 
                                              the defendant was ordered pending

                                              of the house which they had 
                                              previously occupied. The plaintiff 
                                              did not choose to return, but 
                                              three of the children did. </span>

                                              customary-law marriage? The 
                                              Matrimonial Causes Act, 1971 (Act 
                                              367), s. 41 (2) provided that &quot;on

                                              marriage other than a monogamous 
                                              marriage&quot; the court was to apply 
                                              the provisions of the Act to that 
                                              marriage. Had the defendant made 
                                              an application to the court to 
                                              apply the provisions of the Act to 
                                              his marriage? His action had been 
                                              a petition for the dissolution of 
                                              the marriage. Since the customary 
                                              procedures for dissolution did not 
                                              include a court action, he must be 
                                              deemed to have made such an 
                                              application.</span></p>

                                              The court accordingly considered 
                                              the customary-law rules concerning 
                                              occupation of the matrimonial home 
                                              by a wife and children. It held 
                                              that customary law knew no 
                                              personal right of occupation of 
                                              the matrimonial home by a wife, 
                                              and that since the children in 
                                              this case belonged to their 
                                              mother's family they also could 
                                              have no such personal right. A 
                                              court might for the protection of 
                                              the children order the father to 
                                              provide accommodation, but their 
                                              continued occupation of the 
                                              matrimonial home must be subject 
                                              to good behaviour. </span></p>

                                              No authority was cited, and there 
                                              does not appear to have been any 
                                              case-law bearing directly on these 
                                              issues. However, there is case-law 
                                              on the rights of Akan wives and 
                                              children in the matrimonial home 
                                              after the man's death intestate. 
                                              The rationale of the rules in this 
                                              case-law is that the obligations 
                                              owed by a man during his lifetime 
                                              pass to the family which inherits 
                                              his estate. Therefore the cases 
                                              impliedly state the customary-law 
                                              rules applicable during a man's 
                                              life. The earliest cases asserted 
                                              that the widows and children were 
                                              entitled to accommodation. This 
                                              was not expressed as a right 
                                              specifically in the matrimonial 
                                              home, and some cases suggested 
                                              that it might be satisfied by the 
                                              provision of accommodation in a 
                                              house other than one individually 
                                              owned by the deceased.2 The 
                                              children's right was said to be 
                                              subject to good behaviour.3 The 
                                              children's right of accommodation 
                                              has been repeatedly asserted since 
                                              those cases,4 and a few cases add 
                                              mention of a widow's similar 
                                              right.5 However, there has been 
                                              some emphasis on the children's 
                                              right to maintenance and 
                                              education, and the widow's right 
                                              to maintenance.6 It seems possible 
                                              that the law is moving towards the 
                                              conclusion that the wife and 
                                              children are entitled essentially 
                                              to maintenance and in the case of 
                                              children's education, but that in 
                                              appropriate circumstances 
                                              maintenance may be provided partly 
                                              or wholly in kind in the form of 
                                              free accommodation. The cases did 
                                              not clearly indicate whether 
                                              accommodation had to be provided 
                                              in kind if it was available, but 
                                              they did not attach the right to 
                                              any particular accommodation owned 
                                              by the man, such as the 
                                              matrimonial home. The statement in 
                                              the present case summarised above 
                                              seems to clarify the law by 
                                              leaving the form of provision to 
                                              the discretion of the husband and 
                                              father, except where a court deems 
                                              it necessary to order that the 
                                              obligation be met by the provision 
                                              of specific accommodation. In this 
                                              regard, customary law has moved to 
                                              a conclusion similar to that of 
                                              English law, which after some 
                                              controversy has also concluded 
                                              that a wife has no proprietary 
                                              interest in the matrimonial home 
                                              purely by virtue of her status as 
                                              a wife, although she may have a 
                                              personal right therein against the 
                                              husband.7 This outcome avoids the 
                                              growth of a new category of 
                                              encumbrances on land which might 
                                              impede its marketability; and it 
                                              gives the wife's right a pecuniary

                                              The court therefore concluded that 
                                              the plaintiff did not have a 
                                              customary-law right to remain in 
                                              the house; even less did her 
                                              children, who had returned on the 
                                              strength of an order which had 
                                              been granted to their mother, who 
                                              herself had continued to stay out. 
                                              It was thus necessary for the 
                                              court to exercise its jurisdiction 
                                              under the Matrimonial Causes Act, 
                                              1971, having regard to the 
                                              customary law. It may be supposed 
                                              that, if the wife or children had 
                                              had a specific customary-law right 
                                              in the house, the court might have 
                                              hesitated to override this right. 
                                              The absence of any such right 
                                              meant that there was no fetter on 
                                              the court's discretion on an 
                                              application for equitable relief. 
                                              The court proceeded to argue that 
                                              the conditions in the house had 
                                              become such that the children 
                                              should be compelled to leave. It 
                                              held that, although the defendant 
                                              had not asked for their ejectment, 
                                              the court had power to make such 
                                              order as conscience dictated and 
                                              the justice of the case demanded. 
                                              It therefore ordered the children 
                                              to vacate the house within 28 
                                              days. </span></p>
