                                              IN undertaking this review, I 
                                              found myself in an uncomfortable 
                                              position for the fact that I have 
                                              had a great deal of admiration for 
                                              Mr. Justice A. N. E. Amissah (as 
                                              he then was). I owed my graduate 
                                              studies both in Ghana and in the 
                                              United States basically to his 
                                              influence and direction at the 
                                              time when he was the Dean of the 
                                              Faculty of Law of the University 
                                              of Ghana. In addition, he has been 
                                              an outstanding public figure in 
                                              Ghana. His rapid and successful 
                                              career at the Attorney-General's 
                                              Department has been unsurpassed 
                                              and has won the admiration of 
                                              many. He has been one of the most 
                                              dynamic, articulate and able 
                                              judges in the history of the 
                                              Ghanaian judiciary. Finally, he 
                                              has been a great legal scholar. In 
                                              this sense I was not too sure 
                                              whether I could draw a distinction 
                                              between a possible biased or 
                                              over-critical review of his work. 
                                              It is hoped that an objective 
                                              appraisal of the book has been 
                                              achieved.</span></p>

                                              The book can be divided into three 
                                              main parts. The first part, 
                                              chapters 1 through 4, deals 
                                              generally with the functions and 
                                              experiences of the judiciary under 
                                              a variety of nations. Considering 
                                              the functions of the court under 
                                              chapter 1, the author identifies, 
                                              among other things, dispute 
                                              settlement, law enforcement and 
                                              the protection of constitutional 
                                              rights.&nbsp; In addition, he points 
                                              out two other functions which have 
                                              direct bearing on the court’s 
                                              relationship with the other 
                                              branches of government, namely, 
                                              judicial review and advisory 
                                              opinion which is of a modern 
                                              invention.</span></p>

                                              The court in the pursuit of its 
                                              role invariably runs into direct 
                                              conflict with the executive.&nbsp; The 
                                              relationship in this light is 
                                              fully examined in chapter 2.&nbsp; From 
                                              the nature of the discussion and 
                                              on the basis of the world-wide 
                                              examples provided, the author 
                                              leaves the reader in no doubt that 
                                              the executive’s uneasiness to

                                              when they affect the policies of 
                                              the ruling authority) is a normal

                                              unpleasant experience of the

                                              the executive's action, 
                                              particularly in relation to the 
                                              individual liberty, the author 
                                              reveals that most of the 
                                              independent Commonwealth African 
                                              countries have tried various 
                                              methods, independent of the 
                                              executive, in the appointments to 
                                              the bench. This is aimed at 
                                              securing the independence of the 
                                              judiciary. But from the author's 
                                              point of view, it seems no 
                                              approach offers a full-proof 
                                              solution.</span></p>

                                              The judiciary under colonial 
                                              period in the former Commonwealth 
                                              African countries is taken up in 
                                              chapter 3. In this period, one 
                                              could hardly draw a distinction 
                                              between the executive and the 
                                              judiciary as the latter formed an 
                                              integral part of the former and, 
                                              in fact, actively participated in 
                                              most of its functions. The concept 
                                              of the independence of the 
                                              judiciary was thus meaningless. 
                                              The problem posed by this 
                                              uncomfortable relationship and the 
                                              whole impact of colonialism, 
                                              Amissah argues, have transcended 
                                              the colonial period into the 
                                              post-independence era resulting in 
                                              a situation where the independent 
                                              countries cannot find ready

                                              The problem after independence is 
                                              highlighted in chapter 4. In 
                                              almost all cases the British left 
                                              the scene by imposing on the newly 
                                              independent nations, contrary to 
                                              her colonial practice, a 
                                              government of separation of powers 
                                              where the judiciary was expected 
                                              to be independent of the 
                                              executive. But the author points 
                                              out that damage had already been 
                                              done. The judges, used to the old 
                                              practice, had become subservient 
                                              to the executive and therefore 
                                              could not assert its independence. 
                                              Further, trained under and used 
                                              exclusively to the English law, 
                                              the judges relied solely on 
                                              English decisions and precedents 
                                              at the expense of local ones.</span></p>

                                              Amissah here discusses in depth an 
                                              interesting but a controversial 
                                              issue: Whether political 
                                              consideration is to be taken into 
                                              account in the appointment of a 
                                              judge as a means of ensuring the 
                                              outcome of his decisions. He does 
                                              not strictly take sides but merely 
                                              provides the arguments for and 
                                              against situations warranting the 
                                              consideration of political 
                                              inclination. While the discussion 
                                              generally is academically 
                                              interesting, it is doubtful 
                                              whether its extent is worth the 
                                              while. What Amissah fails to 
                                              identify is that in the final 
                                              analysis an appointed judge 
                                              remains himself as an individual. 
                                              He may choose to go any direction 
                                              as Amissah concedes in the case of 
                                              the appointment of Chief Justice 
                                              Warren by President Eisenhower. An 
                                              appointed judge, as his oath 
                                              requires of him, should be 
                                              himself, independent and impartial 
                                              in his decisions.</span></p>

                                              On this issue, Lord Denning has

                                              the author at p. 105 seems to 
                                              concede this point. If any judge 
                                              fails to behave in the way that 
                                              Lord Denning sees him or as 
                                              Justice Amissah wants him to be 
                                              then it is simply the fact that he 
                                              is “human being” with all his 
                                              weaknesses. As such nobody can 
                                              clearly foresee the future 
                                              behaviour of an appointed judge. 
                                              This makes any consideration that 
                                              goes into the appointment of a

                                              in Ghana since independence. Under

                                              of 1966-69. The only case worthy 
                                              of consideration, as the author 
                                              points out, was the Salifu case in 
                                              which both the Supreme Court and 
                                              the High Court reached different 
                                              conclusions regarding the 
                                              executive's interference with 
                                              individual liberty. Surprisingly, 
                                              some measure of judicial 
                                              independence was discernible 
                                              during this period of military 
                                              rule, far from the normal nature 
                                              of military rule. The author 
                                              suggests that the seemingly 
                                              independence of the judiciary was 
                                              due largely to the fact that the 
                                              judiciary recognised its limit: 
                                              that it was operating under a 
                                              military regime which had no 
                                              constitutional restraint in its 
                                              dealings with the judiciary. So 
                                              long as the judiciary refrained 
                                              from decisions which might 
                                              embarrass executive, its 
                                              independence was ensured.</span></p>

                                              boldly by throwing its weight

                                              government was unlawful. The

                                              colonialists&nbsp; It is not only 
                                              impracticable, but also 
                                              unrealistic for the countries to 
                                              go back to the pristine times. He 
                                              refers to the example of Malawi 
                                              which has attempted to introduce 
                                              traditional courts. But as the

                                              liberty. Just before Queen 
                                              Elizabeth of England visited Ghana 
                                              in 1961, it was thought that, as a

                                              criminal should be rounded up and

                                              arrested and detained. Queen 
                                              Elizabeth's visit did not last 
                                              more than three weeks. At the time 
                                              the regime was overthrown in 1966, 
                                              most of these persons were still 
                                              in detention. The Act [The 
                                              Preventive Detention Act] in the 
                                              end was no more a security 
                                              measure. It had simply become an

                                              &quot;The exercise of arbitrary power 
                                              is often associated with a state 
                                              of no law. The supreme despot does 
                                              just what he pleases no matter 
                                              what the law says. Thus, those who 
                                              think of Nkrumah as an autocrat 
                                              tend to picture a situation of 
                                              arbitrary disregard of the law. He 
                                              imprisoned Ghanaians without due 
                                              process of law. He dismissed 
                                              judges capriciously. He set aside 
                                              the ordinary rules accepted as 
                                              ensuring fairness in the case of 
                                              political trials. And at least on 
                                              one occasion he refused to accept 
                                              or to implement the decision of a 
                                              court. But none of these measures 
                                              was taken in Nkrumah's time 
                                              without the backing of law. For 
                                              imprisonment without court process 
                                              Parliament enacted the Preventive 
                                              Detention Act 1958. The 
                                              Constitution of 1960 was amended 
                                              in 1964 after a referendum with 
                                              near-unanimous support to confer

                                              he exercised them they were 
                                              legitimate since they were traced 
                                              directly to the citizens by a 
                                              “near-unanimous support.” That is 
                                              far from the truth. This 
                                              particular referendum and similar 
                                              elections under Nkrumah were 
                                              marked by naked rigging. I recall 
                                              as a secondary (high) school 
                                              student in form four how we were 
                                              virtually dragged to the polling 
                                              station to cast our votes. We were 
                                              all under the voting age of 21 and 
                                              had not been registered as voters. 
                                              In the booth was a policeman who 
                                              directed us to put the ballots in 
                                              the &quot;Yes&quot; box. It was widely known 
                                              that this practice was widespread 
                                              in the country and Amissah cannot 
                                              gloss over such flagrant abuse of 
                                              the voting system by merely 
                                              referring to the result of the 
                                              referendum. As regards Amissah's 
                                              reference to Nkmmah's &quot;observance 
                                              of legal punctilio&quot;: One may 
                                              wonder at the significance of the 
                                              statement. It is hoped, Amissah is 
                                              not suggesting that &quot;legal 
                                              backing&quot; necessarily makes actions 
                                              defendable. Otherwise we may have 
                                              no quarrel against the apartheid 
                                              policies in South Africa or 
                                              against those of the Nazi Germany. 
                                              Everything is and was backed by 
                                              law in those countries 
                                              respectively.</span></p>

                                              The other criticism in Amissah's 
                                              book centres on his overblowing of 
                                              the Busia regime's adverse 
                                              reaction to the Court of Appeal's 
                                              decision in the Sallah case. In 
                                              the first place, Amissah’s 
                                              comparison of the Sallah case with 
                                              the Second Treason Trial case 
                                              under the Nkrumah regime is out of 
                                              proportion. The fundamental issues 
                                              in the two cases are not related. 
                                              While individual lives were at 
                                              stake in the Second Treason Trial 
                                              case, in the Sallah case, it was a 
                                              matter of the proper 
                                              interpretation to be place on the 
                                              provision of the Constitution, 
                                              1969, dealing with the continuance 
                                              in office of public officers under 
                                              the Busia regime. Further, while 
                                              Nkrumah resorted to his usual 
                                              method in nullifying the court's 
                                              decision, Busia contented himself 
                                              with howling—a toothless bulldog. 
                                              This practice by Busia, as the 
                                              author identifies in his earlier 
                                              chapters, is normal with all 
                                              countries which practise the 
                                              theory of separation of powers—the 
                                              executive and the judiciary are 
                                              constantly at loggerheads.</span></p>

                                              The author analyses the question, 
                                              &quot;What should be the role of the 
                                              court in these countries?&quot; In one 
                                              sense, he rightly suggests that, 
                                              “The function of the protection of 
                                              the individual from the abuses of 
                                              power by government and its agents 
                                              has so far been less well 
                                              appreciated by the executive” (p. 
                                              363). In other words, the author 
                                              would like to have courts which 
                                              stand firmly behind individual 
                                              liberties, and that the executive 
                                              should accept this important role 
                                              played by the courts. But at p. 
                                              368 he writes, &quot;There is a need 
                                              for lawyers and judges who are 
                                              sensitive to the values of the 
                                              society . . . A possible 
                                              contribution by the courts . . . 
                                              could be made the judges removing 
                                              from the public mind the view that 
                                              their primary interest is in legal 
                                              technicalities.&quot; That certainly is 
                                              an unfortunate statement. It has 
                                              almost always been in respect of 
                                              the court's desire to protect the 
                                              individual against governmental 
                                              abuses that has resulted in 
                                              frictions between the executive 
                                              and the judiciary and thereby 
                                              giving the executive the excuse to 
                                              resort to the use of the phrase 
                                              &quot;legal technicalities.&quot; It is true 
                                              &quot;there is need for the courts to 
                                              appreciate the ultimate goals of 
                                              the society and within that 
                                              context to play a positive role in 
                                              their achievement.&quot; Those 
                                              &quot;ultimate goals&quot; cannot, however, 
                                              be determined solely from the 
                                              executive point of view. And 
                                              certainly none of those goals is 
                                              more paramount and more enduring 
                                              thin the protection of the 
                                              citizens, especially against 
                                              excesses by the government. It 
                                              should not be forgotten that in 
                                              the final analysis the other 
                                              &quot;ultimate goals&quot; are to enure to 
                                              the benefit of the citizens, 
                                              without whom one cannot talk of 
                                              the existence of a society.</span></p>

                                              It has to be conceded that Amissah 
                                              chose an uneasy topic. The 
                                              judiciary, as an institution, is 
                                              the most complex and delicate 
                                              aspect of government as Amissah’s 
                                              thesis clearly demonstrates. While 
                                              the judiciary has to play its part 
                                              of the role (subtle or in a 
                                              conspicuous manner) in the 
                                              governing of the nation, it must 
                                              maintain its independence from the 
                                              other branches of government. It 
                                              is at the same time expected to
