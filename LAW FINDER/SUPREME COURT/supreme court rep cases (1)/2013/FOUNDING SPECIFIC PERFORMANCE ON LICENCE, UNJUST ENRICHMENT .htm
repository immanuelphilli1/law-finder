                                              were these: The plaintiff who was 
                                              orphaned at a tender age, was 
                                              informally adopted by the mother 
                                              of the defendant. Consequently, 
                                              both parties lived and grew up as 
                                              brother and sister. At a family 
                                              meeting, the plaintiff who had had 
                                              a successful practice as a 
                                              pharmacist intimated that he 
                                              ardently needed a plot to put up a 
                                              dwelling-house. The sister, the 
                                              defendant, offered to convey to 
                                              him her plot of land, on the 
                                              understanding that other members 
                                              of the family would use and enjoy 
                                              the house when completed. She 
                                              consented to his starting the 
                                              building and assured him that she 
                                              would in due course get the land 
                                              conveyed to him.&nbsp; She demanded and

                                              that the name on the building plan 
                                              should be changed to that of a 
                                              female member of the family. This 
                                              was refused. She then stopped the 
                                              construction, and at an ensuing 
                                              family meeting in 1970, she 
                                              requested the plaintiff to submit 
                                              an account of his expenses on the 
                                              building for reimbursement. A bill 
                                              for ¢8,000 as the market value of 
                                              the ¢3,000 spent, was presented in 
                                              1974 after protracted negotiations 
                                              and solicitations by other family 
                                              members to get the defendant to 
                                              rescind her decision had failed.&nbsp; 
                                              In a claim for specific 
                                              performance or in the alternative 
                                              damages for ¢3,000, which was 
                                              amended with the court's leave to 
                                              ¢8,000, the trial court allowed 
                                              the claim for ¢8,000 and held that 
                                              since there was no enforceable 
                                              contractual relationship, specific 
                                              performance could not lie. On 
                                              appeal by the defendant, her 
                                              counsel contended that since there 
                                              was no contract, as determined by 
                                              the trial court, the plaintiff was 
                                              a trespasser and that the 
                                              defendant could not have been in 
                                              breach of any contract to attract 
                                              the award of ¢8,000 damages.</span></p>

                                              Having thus rightly dismissed the 
                                              contention that the plaintiff was 
                                              a trespasser, the Court of Appeal 
                                              had to unravel the knotty issue of 
                                              the award of ¢8,000 damages in 
                                              lieu of specific performance.&nbsp; 
                                              This problem became compounded by 
                                              the fact that the Court of Appeal 
                                              upheld the finding of the trial

                                              Hence the need for a search for a 
                                              basis other than a breach of 
                                              contract to buttress the award of 
                                              ¢8,000.&nbsp; Jiagge and Mensa-Boison

                                              unjust enrichment.&nbsp; Incidentally, 
                                              the plaintiff did not cross-appeal 
                                              on the trial court's refusal to 
                                              award him specific performance.&nbsp; 
                                              This could be one of the reasons 
                                              why the doctrine of licence was 
                                              only considered as a defence to 
                                              trespass.&nbsp; That it is possible to

                                              question then is could the 
                                              plaintiff have been given specific 
                                              performance on this doctrine which 
                                              has been described as equitable

                                              platform.14 Licence has been 
                                              categorised into: (1) a bare 
                                              licence; (2) licence coupled with 
                                              a grant and (3) contractual 
                                              licence. A bare licence is granted 
                                              gratuitously, and even if it is 
                                              under seal, it can be revoked at 
                                              any time with impunity.15 Licence 
                                              may be merely an ancillary to a 
                                              grant of an interest16 in land. 
                                              Such a licence will be 
                                              irrevocable17 if the interest so 
                                              granted is properly and 
                                              effectively transferred. The third 
                                              classification, contractual 
                                              licence, has provoked a lot of 
                                              discussion18 and seems to 
                                              introduce a new19 concept in the 
                                              law of property.</span></p>

                                              This arises where a bare licence 
                                              or a licence not coupled&nbsp; with a 
                                              grant is supported by a 
                                              consideration. At common law such 
                                              a contractual licence can be 
                                              revoked on a reasonable notice, 
                                              and the licensee ejected before 
                                              the expiration of the period 
                                              contemplated by the licence. The 
                                              licensor does not incur any 
                                              tortious liability if after the 
                                              expiration of the notice he uses 
                                              reasonable force to eject the 
                                              licensee.&nbsp; Since he has no 
                                              interest in the land he should not 
                                              remain there after he has beeen 
                                              duly asked to leave.&nbsp; He could, 
                                              however, sue for a breach of 
                                              contract. One such action would 
                                              have, in the estimation of 
                                              Phillimore L.J., attracted a 
                                              contemptuous award of 6d.,20

                                              days.&nbsp; This is the nature of the 
                                              right of a ticket holder at a 
                                              cricket match or at a cinema show. 
                                              In Wood v. Leadbitter21 the

                                              Equity took a contrary stance and 
                                              afforded a better protection to 
                                              such a licensee.&nbsp; This equitable 
                                              rule has its origin in Frogley v. 
                                              Earl of Lovelace22 which provided 
                                              the basis for the ruling in Hurst 
                                              v. Picture Theatres Ltd.23 to the 
                                              effect that if a man has paid for 
                                              his seat at a place of 
                                              entertainment it is not competent 
                                              for the proprietor of the place to 
                                              withdraw the licence and eject the 
                                              spectator if he has entered and 
                                              behaved himself quite properly. 
                                              Injunction would lie under such 
                                              circumstances to restrain the 
                                              proprietor (licensor) from 
                                              revoking the licence. Since equity 
                                              would regard as done that which 
                                              ought to be done, in the eyes of 
                                              equity, the affairs of the 
                                              licensor and licensee should be 
                                              regulated as if the injunction had 
                                              already been granted.&nbsp; The 
                                              licence, therefore, becomes 
                                              irrevocable and the paid spectator 
                                              cannot be ejected even with 
                                              reasonable force. Any interference 
                                              with his person in an attempt to 
                                              throw him out, even after he has 
                                              been given sufficient notice to 
                                              leave, would be condemned in 
                                              damages for assault and in

                                              This principle of equity was found

                                              v. Leadbitter, from which the

                                              distinguishable.&nbsp; In Hurst's case 
                                              the plaintiff paid for a ticket to 
                                              watch a cinema show; when he was 
                                              requested to leave in the mistaken 
                                              belief that he had entered without 
                                              paying, he refused and was 
                                              ejected.&nbsp; He succeeded in an 
                                              action for assault and false 
                                              imprisonment. The English Court of 
                                              Appeal could have simply resolved 
                                              (as it eventually did), this

                                              equity would not aid a

                                              but not the form of a particular 
                                              transaction would fascinate the 
                                              Chancellor, if the intention to be 
                                              bound is evident then lack of 
                                              consideration, which could then 
                                              come in as a matter of formality, 
                                              should not be allowed to defeat

                                              however, true that an outright 
                                              rejection of this maxim would lead 
                                              to a situation where one who was 
                                              not able to develop his land might 
                                              have to concede the use of it to a 
                                              rich man who might have intruded 
                                              and in the teeth of opposition 
                                              from the owner developed the land, 
                                              and later insisted on his right to 
                                              the use of his improvement as 
                                              distinct from the land on which it 
                                              is. It is submitted that in the 
                                              case where a trespasser cultivates 
                                              annual crops i.e. fructus 
                                              industriales on the land of 
                                              another and he cannot protect his 
                                              interest or development by any 
                                              statutory provision59 or rules of 
                                              equity, he should be allowed to 
                                              nurse and harvest the expected 
                                              crops and thereafter within a 
                                              reasonable time, clear the plants 
                                              where necessary, remove any 
                                              temporary structure and vacate the 
                                              land, leaving it as far as 
                                              practicable, in the same condition 
                                              as he found it. He should be made 
                                              to pay damages for his trespass, 
                                              economic rent for the use of the 
                                              land and a reparation for any 
                                              injury to the land. The problem 
                                              becomes more enigmatic when the 
                                              improvements consist of permanent 
                                              crops, i.e. fructus naturales and 
                                              buildings or fixtures. 
                                              Economically, particularly in 
                                              terms of foreign exchange, the 
                                              country may lose, considering the 
                                              various imported inputs which 
                                              would be wasted if the trespasser 
                                              is ordered to remove his crops or 
                                              building, which may have to be 
                                              destroyed. To give the owner of 
                                              the land an option to pay for 
                                              improvements would, in many cases, 
                                              be asking for the impossible.&nbsp; For 
                                              if he had had that much money the 
                                              land might not have lain fallow, 
                                              so as to entice a trespasser.&nbsp; It 
                                              may equally not be fair since he 
                                              would then be ordered to pay for 
                                              an alleged improvement which he 
                                              may not want.&nbsp; And to ask the 
                                              developer&nbsp; to buy the land60 would 
                                              be forcing the owner to sell what 
                                              he may not want to&nbsp; part with, and 
                                              it would open the flood-gate for 
                                              the exploitation of the poor by 
                                              the rich.</span></p>

                                              It would certainly take an extreme 
                                              case for a trespasser to complete 
                                              development of a land with 
                                              buildings or permanent economic 
                                              trees without the acquiescence or 
                                              consent of the landowner.&nbsp; Since 
                                              such cases would be very few and 
                                              far between, the economic loss to 
                                              the country will be extremely 
                                              insignificant. Coupled with this, 
                                              is the need for entrepreneurs to 
                                              be circumspect. It is therefore 
                                              suggested that in the case of 
                                              permanent crops or buildings, the 
                                              developer should be given 
                                              reasonable time to remove any such 
                                              accretion and vacate the land. 
                                              There should be an award of 
                                              damages for his trespass, 
                                              reparation for injury caused, and 
                                              if he derived any income from the 
                                              use of the land, he should be made 
                                              to pay for economic rent. Where 
                                              there was an entry with the 
                                              consent of the landowner, but the 
                                              terms of the permission' were 
                                              exceeded the developer should, to 
                                              that extent, be treated as a 
                                              trespasser as stated above.</span></p>

                                              It, therefore, means that much 
                                              would depend on the intention of 
                                              the parties as disclosed by the

                                              form part of the land the 
                                              developer should have the right to 
                                              remove the improvement not only at 
                                              the end of the term envisaged by 
                                              the licence, tenancy or lease but

                                              thereafter. Where the developer is

                                              land for an indefinite period it 
                                              is possible to plead acquiescence 
                                              (e.g., proprietary estoppel)

                                              protection of any statute, the 
                                              developer should be allowed a 
                                              reasonable time to remove his 
                                              improvements. The maxim, quicquid 
                                              plantatur should, therefore, not 
                                              be a fetter on the exercise of the 
                                              powers of our courts in the 
                                              dispensation of justice.61 The 
                                              injustice sought to be inflicted 
                                              on the plaintiff in Quagraine's 
                                              case was deeply felt by the court 
                                              but it was restrained by the maxim 
                                              quicquid plantatur and was also 
                                              moved by the lack of contractual 
                                              nexus to refuse specific 
                                              performance. These could have been 
                                              surmounted by relying on the 
                                              doctrine of proprietary estoppel 
                                              or equitable licence with some

                                              Incidentally the plaintiff had an 
                                              iron-cast case for the invocation 
                                              of proprietary estoppel; but 
                                              before examining this doctrine let 
                                              us have a quick look at the 
                                              doctrine of unjust enrichment62 on 
                                              which Edusei J. A., based his 
                                              judgment.</span></p>

                                              That was a safe refuge for two 
                                              reasons, viz. firstly, the 
                                              existence of contract was 
                                              immaterial63 not only as to the 
                                              question of liability but also to 
                                              the issue of the appropriate 
                                              measure of damages;64 and 
                                              secondly, the concept is so wide 
                                              and vague as would make one 
                                              suppose that it can conveniently 
                                              accommodate almost all such claims 
                                              which result from the 
                                              unconscionable conduct of a 
                                              defendant. The concept of unjust 
                                              enrichment undoubtedly confers on 
                                              judges &quot;a power to act at their 
                                              discretion in each individual 
                                              case.65 Holdsworth viewed this 
                                              concept of unjust enrichment as so 
                                              vague&nbsp; that its application can 
                                              result in a system where &quot;a lawyer 
                                              asked to advise on a doubtful case 
                                              will be obliged to study, not so 
                                              much the principles of the law, as 
                                              the mentality of his judge.&quot;66 The 
                                              vaguenes of this concept had even 
                                              been preceived from the bench. 
                                              According to Hamilton L.J,67 &quot;To 
                                              ask what course would be ex aequo

                                              very precise guide.&quot;</span></p>

                                              on this doctrine evinced a strong 
                                              urge to rule in favour of the

                                              with the quasi-contract theory as

                                              which have not disappeared,&quot; his 
                                              lordship then commanded that77: 
                                              &quot;When these ghosts of the past 
                                              stand in the path of&nbsp; justice 
                                              clanking their mediaeval chains 
                                              the proper course for the judge is 
                                              to pass through them undeterred.&quot; 
                                              This point has therefore become 
                                              academic78 because of the 
                                              preponderance of authorities in 
                                              favour of unjust enrichment theory 
                                              and not because, as Edusei J.A. 
                                              stated, in a number of cases, 
                                              &quot;both theories would normally lead 
                                              to the same conclusion.&quot; For the 
                                              need for a search for the basis of 
                                              a principle becomes urgent and 
                                              imperative when the principle is 
                                              being stretched to its limits by 
                                              abnormal and not normal cases, and 
                                              it is realised that the foundation 
                                              of that principle cannot support 
                                              changing circumstances where its 
                                              application maylead to absurd and 
                                              unjust results. The implied 
                                              contract theory is certainly too 
                                              restrictive to be sanctioned by 
                                              our courts. The unjust enrichment 
                                              theory as adopted by Edusei J. A. 
                                              is therefore more acceptable.79</span></p>

                                              It is, however, unfortunate that 
                                              there was no attempt to analyse 
                                              this principle to determine how 
                                              best it could squarely accommodate 
                                              the facts of the Quagraine case. 
                                              By the blanket application of the 
                                              principle, Edusei J.A. not only 
                                              obscurred the basic elements of 
                                              the principle but justified the 
                                              fears of the proponents of the 
                                              implied contract theory. For, as 
                                              Holdworth, in subscribing to the 
                                              implied contract theory, said,80 
                                              &quot;Better a system which is too 
                                              rigid than no system at all&quot;. But 
                                              this doctrine has not been left in 
                                              the air; the fact that it is vague 
                                              does not mean that there are no 
                                              conditions precedent to its 
                                              application.81 It can only be 
                                              invoked where (1) the plaintiff 
                                              has conferred some benefit on the 
                                              defendant; (2) who stands to be 
                                              enriched at the expense of the 
                                              plaintiff; and (3) that it would 
                                              not be just to allow the defendant 
                                              to retain the benefit.82</span></p>

                                              The six-bedroom building which had

                                              level would improve the value of

                                              involve the demolition of that 
                                              thing which was considered a

                                              How Edusei J.A. might have 
                                              resolved these related problems 
                                              was left in the realms of a

                                              equally deserves some attention. 
                                              The doctrine calls for 
                                              restitution, i.e. to be given back 
                                              what one has given away.87 Should 
                                              the plaintiff be given back just 
                                              what he has spent, which may sound 
                                              in the value of the accretion?&nbsp; If 
                                              so, should it be the actual value 
                                              of his expenditure or the current 
                                              market price of the improvement? 
                                              Should credit be given for some 
                                              marginal profit or interest on the 
                                              amount spent?&nbsp; And, if so, what 
                                              should be the rate of interest? 
                                              Should it be the bank rate of

                                              in the country? Where the claim 
                                              proceeds on unjust enrichment the 
                                              relief should result in restitutio 
                                              and not damages strictu senso.88

                                              formalistic reason based on 
                                              &quot;account stated.&quot;90 This can be 
                                              understood as having turned on the 
                                              fact that the defendant did not 
                                              question the plaintiff’s claim for 
                                              that amount but that explanation 
                                              is not instructive enough. This 
                                              issue was pertinent; for the 
                                              defendant was questioning the 
                                              basis of the award of the inflated 
                                              sum of ¢8,000 where there was no 
                                              breach of contract, in which case 
                                              the remedy was to be assessed by 
                                              reference to the value of the 
                                              defendant's promise. On the other 
                                              hand, a restitutionary claim 
                                              should be measured by the value of 
                                              what has been executed and 
                                              received by the defendant. As it 
                                              has been rightly stated.91 &quot;A suit 
                                              in contract is based on the notion 
                                              of redressing a breach of 
                                              contract; a suit in quasi-contract 
                                              is based on the principle of 
                                              preventing unjust enrichment.&quot;</span></p>

                                              The unanimous holding of the court 
                                              that it would be unjust to permit 
                                              the defendant in the Quagraine 
                                              case to have the building without 
                                              payment of its value can therefore 
                                              be supported in principle. It 
                                              should be the fair market value of 
                                              the accretion, not merely as at 
                                              the time of trial, but as at the 
                                              time of judgment.92 For experience 
                                              has shown that there is usually an 
                                              undue delay in the delivery of 
                                              judgement after addresses by 
                                              counsel. According to Kom,93 in 
                                              one such case judgment was 
                                              reserved for not less than 
                                              three-and-a-half years. Bearing in 
                                              mind the hyper-inflationary 
                                              conditions prevailing in the 
                                              country, it would be true to say 
                                              that the value of any improvement 
                                              on property would not ever be the 
                                              same after a lapse of one year, 
                                              not to speak of three-and-a-half 
                                              years. The purchasing power of a 
                                              monetary award will 
                                              correspondingly depreciate and the 
                                              successful plaintiff would be 
                                              worse off, while the defendant 
                                              will be enriched by the difference 
                                              between the appreciated value of 
                                              the improvement as at the time of 
                                              the trial and the time of 
                                              judgment. There will be only a 
                                              partial restitution if the 
                                              difference in the value of the 
                                              improvement is not accounted for. 
                                              Since the doctrine seeks merely to 
                                              prevent unjust enrichment it is 
                                              submitted that if a fair market 
                                              value of the alleged improvement 
                                              is less than the expenditure the 
                                              plaintiff should be given an 
                                              amount equivalent to the actual 
                                              market value and not the cost of 
                                              his expenditure and where the 
                                              reasonable value exceeds the 
                                              actual cost of improvement, the 
                                              improver should have the 
                                              reasonable value of the 
                                              improvement, i.e. the difference 
                                              between the improved and 
                                              unimproved value of the land, for 
                                              that is the extent of the benefit 
                                              which the courts seek to deny the 
                                              defendant. This restitution pure 
                                              and simple.</span></p>

                                              It is suggested94 that the exact 
                                              relief should depend on the 
                                              quality of the mistake, the extent 
                                              of expenditure and the nature of 
                                              the defendant's knowledge, and 
                                              that where the defendant has had 
                                              an opportunity to &quot;reject the 
                                              services&quot; he should be deemed to 
                                              have accepted them and should 
                                              therefore be made to pay the 
                                              reasonable value of the services 
                                              even if that is in excess of the 
                                              increased value of the land. 
                                              Essentially they are some of the 
                                              basic elements of the equitable 
                                              doctrine of proprietary estoppel. 
                                              Admittedly, however, three are 
                                              equally some of the factors which 
                                              would bear on the question whether 
                                              it would be unjust to allow the 
                                              defendant to retain the benefit. 
                                              But it would be cutting across the 
                                              bounds of restitution and stepping 
                                              on the threshold of the doctrine 
                                              of equitable estoppel to steal an 
                                              equitable plank to buttress an 
                                              award, which may not be 
                                              restitutionary nor equitable. It 
                                              would be&nbsp; intelligible if the 
                                              appropriate distinctions between

                                              is in view of this that one would

                                              since this case could have been 
                                              decided on the equitable doctrine

                                              equitable lien or tracing.96 As 
                                              already noted, a restitutionary 
                                              claim seeks to recover what has 
                                              been conferred by the plaintiff on 
                                              the defendant and not to enforce 
                                              the promise of the defendant. Thus 
                                              it would have been difficult for 
                                              the plaintiff to proceed on the 
                                              basis of&nbsp; unjust enrichment to 
                                              recover in specie the promised 
                                              land.</span></p>

                                              statement of a very true 
                                              proposition.&nbsp; A man is not to be 
                                              deprived&nbsp; of his legal rights 
                                              unless he has acted in such a way 
                                              as would make it fraudulent for 
                                              him to set up those rights. What, 
                                              then, are the elements or 
                                              requisites necessary to constitute 
                                              fraud of that description?&nbsp; In the 
                                              first place the plaintiff must 
                                              have made a mistake as to his 
                                              legal rights. Secondly, the 
                                              plaintiff must have expended some 
                                              money or must have done some act 
                                              (not necessarily upon the 
                                              defendant's land) on the faith of 
                                              his mistaken belief. Thirdly, the 
                                              defendant, the possessor of the 
                                              legal right, must know of the 
                                              existence of his own right which 
                                              is inconsistent with the right 
                                              claimed by the plaintiff. If he 
                                              does not know of it he is in the 
                                              same position as the plaintiff, 
                                              and the doctrine of acquiescence 
                                              is founded upon conduct with a 
                                              knowledge of your legal rights. 
                                              Fourthly, the defendant, the 
                                              possessor of the legal right, must 
                                              know of the plaintiff's mistaken 
                                              belief of his rights. If he does 
                                              not, there is nothing which calls 
                                              upon him to assert his own rights. 
                                              Lastly, the defendant, the 
                                              possessor of the legal right, must 
                                              have encouraged the plaintiff in 
                                              his expenditure of money or in the 
                                              other acts which he has done, 
                                              either directly or by abstaining 
                                              from asserting his legal right. 
                                              Where all these elements exist, 
                                              there is fraud of such a nature as 
                                              will entitle the Court to restrain 
                                              the possessor of the legal right 
                                              from exercising it, but, in my 
                                              judgment, nothing short of this 
                                              will do.&quot;</span></p>

                                              succeed, and it was when at last

                                              the defendant, provided it 
                                              remained in the matrilineal 
                                              family. Hence her insistence on 
                                              the documents being prepared in 
                                              the name of a female member of the 
                                              family. This will, however, sound 
                                              a specious argument if it is 
                                              considered that the main objective 
                                              and incentive to the plaintiff was 
                                              the transfer of the title to him. 
                                              It was certainly fraudulent on the 
                                              part of the defendant to keep 
                                              mute, and by her silence encourage 
                                              the plaintiff in his building 
                                              activities after she had had a 
                                              change of mind and thereafter 
                                              sought to recover the land 
                                              together with the plaintiff's 
                                              improvement thereon. This might 
                                              have been after she had conferred 
                                              with her husband who expressed a 
                                              similar desire to put up a house 
                                              on the same plot.</span></p>

                                              argued, as counsel in Crabb v.

                                              that this doctrine could be 
                                              invoked even if the mistake arises

                                              owns land but is not able to 
                                              develop it, due to poverty or 
                                              other causes, any rich man or any 
                                              man in position, knowing full well 
                                              that the land does not belong to 
                                              him, can just enter on to that 
                                              land, spend money by building on

                                              would exploit the poor and lowly, 
                                              and the country would be in

                                              genuineness of the plaintiff's 
                                              belief in the expectation of title 
                                              to the land was quite clear and so

                                              One can hardly therefore fathom 
                                              the basis for the denial of 
                                              specific performance to the 
                                              plaintiff in the Quagraine case. 
                                              The learned Justice of Appeal 
                                              confused this doctrine with 
                                              contractual licence and justified 
                                              his denial of specific performance 
                                              in terms which are based on the 
                                              fallacy that only a contract can 
                                              attract specific performance. 
                                              Mensa-Boison J.A. said, &quot;Now the 
                                              relief in equity is not based on 
                                              the claim for specific 
                                              performance. For as there was no 
                                              consideration there was no 
                                              contract to be enforced 
                                              specifically.&quot; He was, therefore, 
                                              of the view that the appropriate 
                                              remedy was &quot;the sum of ¢8,000 
                                              which is likewise supported by the 
                                              same equity, or a declaration that 
                                              the fee simple of the house was 
                                              vested in the plaintiff.&quot; With 
                                              much deference to the learned 
                                              Justice of Appeal, this is a gross 
                                              underestimation of the 
                                              potentialities of the doctrine of 
                                              proprietary estoppel and it cannot 
                                              be correct. Declaration of title 
                                              can be efficacious in certain 
                                              cases, but if specific performance 
                                              is the only remedy which can give 
                                              effect to the equity, the court 
                                              should feel free to issue it. It 
                                              has also been made crystal clear 
                                              that the equity does not depend on 
                                              the availability of contract:</span></p>

                                              welcome exception to the maxim,

                                              From a careful observation one may 
                                              be inclined to the view that the 
                                              plaintiff was content with the 
                                              award of monetary relief; in which 
                                              case the basis for his claim for 
                                              specific performance became 
                                              questionable. For, generally, 
                                              specific performance would only 
                                              issue where damages would not be 
                                              adequate. It is noteworthy that 
                                              there was no cross-appeal on the 
                                              trial court's denial of specific 
                                              performance. Coupled with this is 
                                              the plaintiff's tender of a bill 
                                              of ¢8,000 and the form in which 
                                              his claim was cast, i.e. making 
                                              specific performance an 
                                              alternative relief, which tend to 
                                              show that plaintiff had long 
                                              resigned himself to the situation 
                                              and that the monetary award would 
                                              be adequate to him. In fact, it 
                                              seems Jiagge J.A. would have 
                                              granted specific performance but 
                                              for the fact that she observed 
                                              that there was no cross-appeal and 
                                              that the plaintiff sought an order 
                                              for ¢3,000 damages as an 
                                              alternative relief to specific 
                                              performance.&nbsp; No one would cavil 
                                              with the stance of Jiagge J.A. in 
                                              not granting specific performance 
                                              for the simple reason that there 
                                              was no appeal on the trial court's 
                                              refusal to issue the same. But 
                                              Jiagge J.A.'s other view which 
                                              purports to establish that where a 
                                              plaintiff claims damages as an 
                                              alternative relief he should be 
                                              denied specific performance 
                                              provokes doubt, which could only 
                                              have been dispelled if she (the 
                                              learned Justice of Appeal) had 
                                              buttressed it with an authority. A 
                                              case in point is Dowling v. 
                                              Betjemann136 where the contention 
                                              that the plaintiff had claimed 
                                              damages as an alternative relief 
                                              was sustained as a successful 
                                              defence to specific performance.&nbsp; 
                                              In that case, Sir Page-Wood 
                                              over-simplified the claim thus137:</span></p>

                                              not refuse specific performance 
                                              although the plaintiff might have

                                              adequate remedy .or at least were 
                                              so regarded by the plaintiffs and

                                              had applied this principle of 
                                              Sachs L.J. Having posed the

                                              the market value of the 
                                              improvement as in 1974 (as Jiagge 
                                              and Mensa-Boison JJ.A. held), it 
                                              cannot be reasonably contended 
                                              that in April 1977 when the suit 
                                              was initiated and in April 1979

                                              fair to take the value of the 
                                              improvement as at the time when it 
                                              was effected and compare it with 
                                              the value of the land as at the 
                                              same time, and then determine 
                                              whether the improvement as 
                                              compared with the land is so 
                                              considerable as to allow the 
                                              improver to take the land and the 
                                              improvement.&nbsp; There is much force 
                                              in the view that an expenditure of 
                                              ¢1,000 on an asset worth ¢3,000 
                                              cannot give rise to such equities 
                                              as to call for specific

                                              for a proprietary remedy.&nbsp; In

                                              property was not enough.&nbsp; But the 
                                              same cannot be said of an 
                                              improvement costing ¢3,000 on an 
                                              asset which may not have been 
                                              worth more than ¢500.</span></p>

                                              have been different. But it is 
                                              unpleasant to remark that such an 
                                              important case turned on a

                                              performance.&nbsp; The doctrine of

                                              the attention of the court in this

                                              intervention in this area. It is 
                                              rather unfortunate that the

                                              the equity. The learned author 
                                              concedes that &quot;equity is prepared 
                                              to give additional relief to 
                                              compel the representor to make 
                                              good his representation,&quot; but 
                                              expresses some reservation as to 
                                              the usefulness of such a remedy, 
                                              since he is of the view that 
                                              estoppel on its own operates at 
                                              common law as a conveyance. He 
                                              notes, however, that &quot;there is a 
                                              trend today towards giving 
                                              documents to confirm customary law 
                                              conveyance of land, and if this 
                                              trend continues it may be 
                                              considered desirable to insist on 
                                              documents to confirm conveyances 
                                              by estoppel.&quot; It is of some 
                                              significance to note here that the 
                                              Conveyancing Decree, 1973, seeks 
                                              to make it mandatory for all
