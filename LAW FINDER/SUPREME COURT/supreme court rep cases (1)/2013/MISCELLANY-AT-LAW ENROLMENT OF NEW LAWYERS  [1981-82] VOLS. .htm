                                              Hon. Mr. Justice F. K. Apaloo, to 
                                              deliver a speech at the formal 
                                              meeting of the General Legal

                                              speech, dealt with a number of 
                                              issues affecting the judiciary 
                                              vis-à-vis the revolutionary organs 
                                              of the 31 December 1981 
                                              Revolution. He made trenchant 
                                              observations on the P.N.D.C. 
                                              Government's attitude to the 
                                              judiciary and the law; he also 
                                              dealt with the issue of whether in 
                                              view of the challenges to the 
                                              judiciary by the revolutionary 
                                              organs of the Revolution, i.e. the 
                                              P.D.C.s and the W.D.C.s, the 
                                              traditional courts have lost their 
                                              value and whether the legal 
                                              profession has any future in 
                                              Ghana. He also made some

                                              the People's Tribunal set up under 
                                              P.N.D.C.L. 24. The Review presents

                                              take this opportunity of welcoming

                                              invitation. In a society which 
                                              desires to be ruled by laws rather 
                                              than men, this healthy interest in 
                                              the law is encouraging. It is 
                                              probable that to some of the 
                                              guests we have here this morning, 
                                              the law offers no particular 
                                              attraction. And that your presence 
                                              here this morning is to give moral 
                                              support to a son or daughter, 
                                              friend or relative who is being 
                                              called to the Bar. It requires 
                                              some effort to do even this and to

                                              to as the learned profession, but

                                              most of you went through the 
                                              arduous training that today 
                                              justifies your entry into one of 
                                              the oldest and respected 
                                              professions. Very many 
                                              congratulations indeed!</span></p>

                                              the profession and prove 
                                              themselves worthy of the

                                              Having successfully gone through 
                                              your legal studies and have been 
                                              called to the Bar, I cannot but 
                                              assume that you have some grasp of 
                                              the law. I would say, perhaps 
                                              without disrespect, the rudiments 
                                              of the law. At the Bar, your real 
                                              learning of the law will 
                                              begin—possibly with each case that 
                                              you are confronted with. Human 
                                              affairs vary with each man's face. 
                                              So are his problems. These you 
                                              must study afresh. No two cases 
                                              are exactly alike. Each case must 
                                              be studied together with its 
                                              special problems. If you delude 
                                              yourselves into thinking that the 
                                              study of law ends with your call 
                                              to the Bar, you cannot lay a surer 
                                              foundation for professional 
                                              failure. In other words, you must 
                                              apply in the practice of the law, 
                                              the same diligence and industry 
                                              that you applied to your studies. 
                                              Experience shows that many more 
                                              cases are lost by insufficient 
                                              preparation than by want of 
                                              intrinsic merit.</span></p>

                                              unceasing industry to them alone.

                                              It is now necessary to turn to, 
                                              what I would call, matters of the 
                                              moment. I am sure, on an occasion 
                                              like this, the citizens of this 
                                              county would expect me to review 
                                              the year and say how the legal 
                                              profession has fared since the 31 
                                              December Revolution. When I 
                                              addressed the law students of the 
                                              University of Ghana during their 
                                              Law Week in May this year, I 
                                              attempted an analysis of what I 
                                              saw as the attitude of the 
                                              Provisional National Defence 
                                              Council towards the existing legal 
                                              system. It is impossible to 
                                              conceive of any ordered society 
                                              without law, even if that society 
                                              is said to be undergoing a 
                                              revolution. So the Provisional 
                                              National Defence Council 
                                              (Establishment) Proclamation, 
                                              1981, not only saved all laws in 
                                              existence before the Revolution, 
                                              but it continues the appointment 
                                              of all judges and other judicial

                                              The Proclamation gave notice that 
                                              public tribunals would be 
                                              established to try specified 
                                              offences. That intention was 
                                              carried into effect by the passage 
                                              of the Public Tribunals Law, 1982 
                                              (P.N.D.C.L. 24). That tribunal was 
                                              to be not only a trial court but 
                                              also a final court because its 
                                              decisions are not subject to 
                                              appeal or open to review either by 
                                              the ordinary courts or indeed by 
                                              the P.N.D.C. itself. Someone told 
                                              me that unlike the ordinary 
                                              courts, the public tribunal is a 
                                              law unto itself. That really is 
                                              not my point—the Chairman of the 
                                              P.N.D.C. has said the public will 
                                              be left to judge which of the 
                                              courts is preferable and for that 
                                              judgment, we should wait.</span></p>

                                              The point I make is that the 
                                              P.N.D.C. has left practically 
                                              untouched the legal system and the 
                                              pre-revolution laws. I used the 
                                              word &quot;practically&quot; advisedly, 
                                              because P.N.D.C. Laws 1 and 19 
                                              creating the Citizens Vetting 
                                              Committee and the Special Military 
                                              Tribunal respectively, gave 
                                              limited judicial powers to these 
                                              two bodies. That aside, the 
                                              P.N.D.C. has left the courts and 
                                              the legal system alone. Indeed, on 
                                              one occasion when I wrote to the 
                                              government about the interference 
                                              with court functions by armed 
                                              personnel, I received the written 
                                              assurance of the P.N.D.C., that 
                                              these would be stopped.</span></p>

                                              Some of the first effects of the 
                                              Revolution were attacks on the 
                                              courts mostly in landlord and 
                                              tenant and other property cases. 
                                              Tenants who lost their cases in 
                                              court were able to get soldiers to 
                                              stop the execution of the courts’ 
                                              orders by beating up the 
                                              magistrates who gave the orders 
                                              and the staff who attempted to 
                                              carry out the orders. This was 
                                              mostly at the magistrates' level, 
                                              but the High Courts had their 
                                              share of the disturbance. In one 
                                              gruesome case at Cape Coast, a 
                                              chief who was a party in a 
                                              chieftaincy dispute was taken away 
                                              by soldiers as he left the High 
                                              Court and shot outside the town. 
                                              We never got to know what happened 
                                              to his murderers.</span></p>

                                              new element was later introduced 
                                              into the situation. This was the 
                                              belief, which soon became 
                                              prevalent, that there was a 
                                              P.N.D.C. directive that no tenant 
                                              should be ejected. It has never 
                                              been known to anyone in the 
                                              judiciary whether the P.N.D.C. or 
                                              anyone associated with it ever 
                                              issued such a directive. In any 
                                              case, the belief intensified the 
                                              interference in the functioning of 
                                              the courts and the attacks on the 
                                              staff. People’s Defence Committee 
                                              members and soldiers took it upon 
                                              themselves to stop the execution 
                                              of any order of recovery of 
                                              possession. I had a petition from 
                                              an eighty-year-old woman who, 
                                              following a report made to Mr. 
                                              Amartey Kwei, the erstwhile member 
                                              of the P.N.D.C. by her tenant, 
                                              was, together with her daughters, 
                                              taken to Burma Camp and beaten for 
                                              attempting to recover her room 
                                              from the tenant after a successful 
                                              law suit. One of Mr. Amartey 
                                              Kwei's orders was that the house 
                                              should be confiscated to the State 
                                              and the tenant should now act as 
                                              caretaker for the State while the 
                                              woman and her children became 
                                              tenants. That injustice has since 
                                              been redressed.</span></p>

                                              Our magistrates, who were not 
                                              aware of any P.N.D.C. directives 
                                              to that effect, sought 
                                              clarification from me. As a result 
                                              of representations made to the 
                                              government, the Secretary for 
                                              Justice and Attorney-General, on 
                                              the authority of the P.N.D.C.,

                                              get reports of court orders being 
                                              interfered with for the same

                                              So far as I have said, the 
                                              interference with the courts had 
                                              been directed mostly at the 
                                              magistrates' courts. Then in July, 
                                              three High Court Judges were 
                                              abducted from their homes and 
                                              murdered in cold blood. This 
                                              naturally threw the whole of the 
                                              legal profession into a state of 
                                              shock and panic because it seemed 
                                              to foreshadow an organised attempt 
                                              to eliminate judges. It led to a 
                                              suspension of the sittings of all 
                                              the courts and many of the 
                                              superior court judges went 
                                              overseas to recover from the 
                                              shock. At least six of them have 
                                              not yet returned and the working 
                                              of the Superior courts has been 
                                              greatly hampered thereby.</span></p>

                                              On the murder of the judges, I 
                                              have been made aware of some 
                                              criticism made of the judges as a 
                                              group and the Chief Justice as its 
                                              head. It was asked why the judges 
                                              did not resign en bloc or at least 
                                              put up a more strongly worded 
                                              statement than they in fact did. I

                                              questions were asked by 
                                              well-meaning citizens who feel

                                              But these questions are not 
                                              difficult to answer. A person 
                                              resigns from public service 
                                              usually on a point of principle or 
                                              if he happens to be a member of 
                                              the government, because of his 
                                              inability to subscribe to a major 
                                              government policy for which he and 
                                              his other government colleagues 
                                              have collective responsibility. 
                                              What issue of principle is 
                                              involved in the murder of the 
                                              judges? That a dastardly crime was 
                                              committed, there was no doubt. 
                                              That the perpetrators deserve to 
                                              be identified and punished, seems 
                                              clear enough. The government's 
                                              publicly stated position was that 
                                              these culprits would be traced and 
                                              punished in accordance with the 
                                              laws of this country. The Chairman 
                                              of the P.N.D.C. gave public 
                                              expression to his suspicion that 
                                              the perpetrators might well be 
                                              persons opposed to the government 
                                              or persons with ostensible 
                                              sympathy for it. He said neither 
                                              would be spared. In response to 
                                              public demand, the government set 
                                              up an independent investigation 
                                              board to trace the murderers so 
                                              that they can be brought to book. 
                                              If present rumours are anything to 
                                              go by, this board has identified 
                                              some of the culprits and the 
                                              Attorney-General has statutory 
                                              responsibility to invoke the legal 
                                              sanction against these wrongdoers. 
                                              This is now awaited.1 What point 
                                              of principle is involved to 
                                              justify either the Chief Justice 
                                              or the judges walking out on their 
                                              jobs? And what benefit to the 
                                              public would result thereby?</span></p>

                                              The truth is that the ordinary 
                                              citizens who daily invoke the 
                                              assistance of the courts in 
                                              protecting their rights would be 
                                              the losers. The judges who are 
                                              matured citizens are knowledgeable 
                                              enough to understand these issues. 
                                              And not one of the nearly 40 
                                              judges of the superior courts has 
                                              resigned his office on account of 
                                              the regrettable events of July 
                                              last.</span></p>

                                              The other criticism of the judges 
                                              in connection with the murders 
                                              brought to my notice, is that the 
                                              judges did not react by a strongly 
                                              worded statement. Those who held 
                                              this view cannot have realised 
                                              both the anguish and dilemma in 
                                              which all the judges were placed 
                                              by this sad event. When the 
                                              disappearance of the judges was 
                                              made public, the judges at a 
                                              hurriedly convened meeting 
                                              appointed a delegation of nine of 
                                              its members to meet the P.N.D.C. 
                                              They did so on 3 July 1982 and 
                                              expressed their shock and 
                                              abhorrence at the abductions. The 
                                              delegation was assured that the 
                                              government, for its part, was 
                                              doing its best to locate the 
                                              whereabouts of the judges and set 
                                              them at liberty. When their 
                                              murders were announced on Sunday 4 
                                              July, the judges again convened an 
                                              emergency meeting the next day, 
                                              i.e. 5 July. It was there that 
                                              their anguish was matched only by 
                                              the dilemma in which they found 
                                              themselves. It was plain the 
                                              heinous crimes of murders were 
                                              committed. And if the murderers 
                                              were found and prosecuted as the 
                                              Chairman promised, these trials 
                                              would be conducted by judges.2 If 
                                              the judges by a statement reacted 
                                              in intemperate language, questions 
                                              may arise if they were not all 
                                              disqualified by reason of legal 
                                              bias from participating in any 
                                              future trials. As they saw it, the 
                                              best course was to express their 
                                              horror in guarded terms and to 
                                              announce the suspension of normal 
                                              judicial work for an indefinite 
                                              period out of respect for the 
                                              memory of their colleagues. This 
                                              is what was done. If the judges by 
                                              a very violent statement against 
                                              the wrongdoers who were then 
                                              unknown, disqualified themselves 
                                              from trying them in the future, 
                                              were new persons inexperienced in 
                                              judicial work to be appointed 
                                              purposely to try these culprits? I 
                                              think these criticisms, perhaps 
                                              well-intentioned, were based on a 
                                              faulty knowledge of the facts. 
                                              Even for the limited period that 
                                              the judges stayed away from the 
                                              courts, I received a number of 
                                              petitions by ordinary citizens who 
                                              complained that hardship was being 
                                              caused to them by the non-sitting 
                                              of the courts.</span></p>

                                              Now, following the murders, the 
                                              interference with the functioning 
                                              of the courts has developed into 
                                              what may be described as its 
                                              logical conclusion. It has now 
                                              taken the form of the closing down 
                                              of the courts by members of 
                                              W.D.C.s and P.D.C.s. Their reasons 
                                              are that they don't like the way 
                                              the magistrates try cases or that 
                                              the magistrates are not 
                                              revolutionary enough. In one town, 
                                              the W.D.C. demanded that a woman 
                                              who had been accused of stealing a 
                                              fowl should be banished from the 
                                              town. The magistrate explained 
                                              that, as the woman was a citizen 
                                              of the town, she could not be so 
                                              banished. This was one of the 
                                              charges which led to the closure 
                                              of his court; they said he was not

                                              So far, five courts have been 
                                              closed in this way and it was with 
                                              some dismay that I learned that, 
                                              in some cases, the police were 
                                              present but did nothing to stop 
                                              the closing down of the court. In 
                                              one town, the W.D.C. members who 
                                              closed the court gave the keys to 
                                              the police chief there. Strangely 
                                              enough, not only did the police 
                                              chief refuse to give the keys to 
                                              the magistrate, but he went as far 
                                              as to demand the surrender of any 
                                              duplicate keys that the staff 
                                              might have. He said he would 
                                              return the keys to the staff after 
                                              the two sides had settled the 
                                              matter! In another town, the 
                                              police stood by because they said 
                                              their duty was to maintain law and 
                                              order and not to take sides. But 
                                              one would have thought that 
                                              preventing unauthorised persons 
                                              from forcibly closing down a court 
                                              in session would be classified as 
                                              maintenance of law and order and 
                                              not as taking sides.</span></p>

                                              Quite apart from these 
                                              interferences with the courts, 
                                              there have been assaults on 
                                              lawyers. One lawyer was dragged 
                                              out of a family tribunal and 
                                              brutally beaten by soldiers. The 
                                              soldiers had been instigated by 
                                              that lawyer's own client! In one 
                                              regional capital, a so-called 
                                              progressive group invaded the 
                                              chambers of the lawyers and took 
                                              away all their briefs and other 
                                              papers. All these matters were 
                                              brought to the notice of the 
                                              government.</span></p>

                                              am glad to be able to say that the 
                                              Chairman of the P.N.D.C. has 
                                              publicly condemned these acts. 
                                              However, the public denunciation 
                                              has not had the desired effect for 
                                              the simple reason that the 
                                              criminals and perpetrators have 
                                              not been punished. Experience 
                                              shows that mere warning and 
                                              admonition unaccompanied by strong 
                                              actions is usually futile and 
                                              tends rather to invite ridicule 
                                              and contempt.</span></p>

                                              further development has taken 
                                              place. In some places the W.D.C.s 
                                              and P.D.C.s are holding their own 
                                              courts. I am told that they prefer 
                                              their own charges, adopt their own 
                                              procedures and impose their own 
                                              fines which sometimes run into 
                                              thousands of cedis.</span></p>

                                              <span style="font-family: Arial">I 
                                              have been asked whether these 
                                              courts are lawful. My answer is, 
                                              of course, that they are not. 
                                              First of all, no law has set up 
                                              P.D.C. courts. A court is legal 
                                              only when it is created by law. 
                                              Secondly, in a trial in the 
                                              regular courts, a person knows the 
                                              law he has infringed and the 
                                              penalty he is likely to suffer. 
                                              And he is given the opportunity to 
                                              defend himself by counsel if he 
                                              chooses to have one. None of these 
                                              prerequisites exists in the P.D.C. 
                                              courts. And no one knows what 
                                              happens to the fines or to whom 
                                              they are accounted for. Fines 
                                              exacted by the ordinary courts are 
                                              paid into the general revenue of 
                                              the State. It is obvious that the 
                                              so-called accused persons pay 
                                              these fines for fear of physical 
                                              molestation. If a person refused 
                                              to pay such a fine or even to 
                                              attend a P.D.C. court, he would be 
                                              perfectly within his rights and 
                                              the government should take steps 
                                              to make it possible for loyal 
                                              citizens to assert their rights 
                                              against crude force.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

                                              In the early days of the 31

                                              columnist's view on you in too 
                                              much detail. But the writer seems 
                                              to me to have delivered himself of 
                                              matters peculiarly appropriate to 
                                              a proper appraisal of the current 
                                              events in this country. He has 
                                              also put up a point of view, which 
                                              you may think, makes an 
                                              intelligent contribution to the 
                                              contemporary politics of Ghana—a 
                                              viewpoint that can be looked at 
                                              with profit. It certainly would be 
                                              unwise to dismiss it lightly. I 
                                              invite you all to read this 
                                              article, ponder over it and 
                                              conclude for yourselves which of 
                                              these sentiments you agree with or 
                                              which of them you find yourself in 
                                              disagreement with. As lawyers, you 
                                              have been trained to do objective 
                                              analysis of issues before 
                                              pronouncing a judgment. </span>

                                              courts, but of gross ignorance. 
                                              The ignorance is well illustrated

                                              writ was issued by a plaintiff 
                                              claiming about ¢200.000 from a 
                                              corporation. The corporation's 
                                              solicitor, realising that the 
                                              corporation had a bad case, 
                                              advised that it should negotiate 
                                              with the plaintiff and settle the 
                                              matter out of court. This was 
                                              agreed and while the solicit or 
                                              was negotiating with the 
                                              plaintiff's solicitor, he was 
                                              summoned to go to the P.N.D.C. 
                                              Information Office. Obviously, the 
                                              plaintiff had gone to seek 
                                              extra-legal solution to the 
                                              problem. When the corporation’s 
                                              solicitor went to the information 
                                              office, the soldiers asked him to 
                                              produce the money. What money? he 
                                              asked. The ¢200,000 that was to be 
                                              paid to that man, they replied. 
                                              But, he said, no agreement has 
                                              been reached. They did not 
                                              understand, so, finally he 
                                              produced a copy of the writ which 
                                              bore the figure of ¢200,000 and 
                                              asked, &quot;Is this what you mean”? 
                                              The soldiers said &quot;Yes.&quot; And he 
                                              explained to them that that was 
                                              only a writ showing the amount 
                                              which the aggrieved person was 
                                              claiming from the corporation. The 
                                              matter had not been settled yet. 
                                              It has not even gone to court at 
                                              all!</span></p>

                                              I have already said, that the 
                                              people who are disturbing the 
                                              functioning of the courts are only 
                                              a small fraction of the

                                              Finally, it seems to me, what is 
                                              going on is largely the result of 
                                              economic necessity. Ghanaians are 
                                              suffering great economic hardship 
                                              and, as is well known, a hungry 
                                              man is ruled by the need to 
                                              survive and not by reason or 
                                              considerations of fairness. If a 
                                              tenant cannot pay his rent and his 
                                              landlord gets a court order to 
                                              take the room from him, then 
                                              (regardless of the reasonableness 
                                              or otherwise of the court order) 
                                              he will welcome anyone who says 
                                              there is a P.N.D.C. directive that 
                                              no tenant should be ejected. Also, 
                                              if, in these hard times, a man 
                                              loses a case and his property is 
                                              to be sold but there are armed 
                                              soldiers ready to stop the sale, 
                                              he will turn to them regardless of 
                                              whether the court’s decision is 
                                              fair or not. It is simply a 
                                              question of survival and not a 
                                              loss of confidence in the courts.</span></p>

                                              a fair evaluation of the quality 
                                              of their decisions. I think the 
                                              persons best suited to pass a 
                                              judgment on these tribunals are 
                                              either the persons who witness 
                                              their proceedings or anyone who 
                                              has access to their records. I do 
                                              not feel qualified to do so.</span></p>

                                              It is my hope that all these 
                                              difficulties in the way of the 
                                              profession will clear with time. 
                                              The ship is indeed rocking and 
                                              reeling at this moment but that 
                                              must not be allowed to portray a 
                                              gloomy future for the legal 
                                              profession. No nation can afford 
                                              to do without the institutions of 
                                              the judiciary, law and lawyers. 
                                              Even now, we have persons 
                                              described as progressive lawyers 
                                              who are apparently acceptable.</span></p>

                                              It is true that lawyers often come 
                                              in for criticism especially during 
                                              times of change. Some of the 
                                              criticism is deserved and I have 
                                              myself, for example, deplored the 
                                              activities of some lawyers in 
                                              their handling of insurance 
                                              claims. However, by and large, 
                                              they are indispensable instruments 
                                              for achieving a fair balance 
                                              between the needs of society and 
                                              protection of the individual.</span></p>

                                              Well, ladies and gentlemen, this 
                                              is not intended to be a real 
                                              policy speech, or what in American 
                                              parlance will be &quot;a state of the 
                                              Union&quot; message. It is only to be a 
                                              welcome and congratulatory address 
                                              to our young lawyers. Before I am 
                                              done, let me make this observation 
                                              which I have consistently made to 
                                              new law graduates. You are heirs 
                                              to a great heritage and it is not 
                                              an unreasonable ambition to have 
                                              an eye on history, to reflect what 
                                              reputation you will acquire and by 
                                              what you will be remembered 
                                              hereafter. Most of the giants of 
                                              the profession that we met are no 
                                              more. Sooner or later, those of us 
                                              who are temporarily entrusted with 
                                              responsibility will pass it on to 
                                              you. Each of you must put to 
                                              himself or herself the question 
                                              &quot;by what would I wish to be 
                                              remembered?&quot; I trust the 
                                              profession will treat you kindly, 
                                              so that when you leave it as we 
                                              all must do some day, you will 
                                              leave behind a reputation which 
                                              future generation of lawyers would 
                                              be proud of.</span></p>
