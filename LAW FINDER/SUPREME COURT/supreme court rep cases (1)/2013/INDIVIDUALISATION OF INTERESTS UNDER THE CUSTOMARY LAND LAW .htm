                                              18971 marked the beginning of a

                                              customary schemes of tenure in 
                                              which the tendency was to regard 
                                              the interest which an individual 
                                              member of a land-holding community

                                              Today, some students of the 
                                              indigenous law would even go so 
                                              far as to assert that the 
                                              customary schemes of interest in 
                                              land can now be regarded as 
                                              approximating to a freehold title 
                                              on the same footing as the term is 
                                              understood under English law with 
                                              its connotations. To those who 
                                              hold this view, the evolution of 
                                              the customary interest into a 
                                              freehold is not necessarily 
                                              incompatible with the &quot;trusteeship 
                                              idea&quot; which is essentially an 
                                              ethical justification of 
                                              property.2</span></p>

                                              To some of the proponents of this 
                                              view, the trend towards 
                                              individualisation is progressive 
                                              and ought to be encouraged and 
                                              crystallised under a scheme of 
                                              title registration.3 This, it is 
                                              believed, holds the key to the 
                                              efficient and effective land use 
                                              for economic development. It is 
                                              further argued that such a 
                                              transformation of the traditional 
                                              interest into a freehold, is a 
                                              necessary condition for easy 
                                              accessibility to agricultural 
                                              credit since such a title could be 
                                              used as security for loans from 
                                              financial institutions.4</span></p>

                                              The kind of transformation 
                                              envisaged by this school of 
                                              thought raises serious questions 
                                              regarding the efficient and 
                                              improved methods of productivity, 
                                              the distribution of resources in 
                                              society, and the raising of 
                                              standards of living. Even as of 
                                              now, over 60 per cent of the 
                                              working population in Ghana is 
                                              engaged in the exploitation of 
                                              landed resources.5 The ecological 
                                              processes of such resource 
                                              exploitation normally occur within 
                                              the family milieu and their 
                                              distribution is usually channelled 
                                              through the same medium in rural 
                                              communities where the basic tools 
                                              of production are still the 
                                              proverbial hoe and the cutlass.</span></p>

                                              What has never been seriously 
                                              considered by those who advocate 
                                              individualisation of interests 
                                              under the traditional system, 
                                              however, is the likely effect 
                                              which such changes in the tenure 
                                              system will have on the

                                              It is the main objective of this 
                                              article to highlight the way in 
                                              which the judiciary, through the 
                                              adjudicative processes of the 
                                              courts, has influenced the 
                                              direction of policy towards 
                                              individualisation of interest 
                                              under the traditional system

                                              sought to encourage and promote

                                              The driving force behind this 
                                              movement was Sir William Brandford 
                                              Griffith C.J., whose views held 
                                              sway over the superior courts of 
                                              judicature in the Gold Coast at 
                                              the beginning of the twentieth 
                                              century. The basic idea underlying 
                                              his decisions was that the new 
                                              trends in land use patterns 
                                              fashioned by the introduction of 
                                              perennial crops, made it 
                                              inevitable for the individual to 
                                              occupy land for long periods of 
                                              time. For this reason, the landed 
                                              interest of the person in such 
                                              permanent occupation ought to be 
                                              regarded as having evolved into an 
                                              absolute individual ownership of 
                                              the soil or land to which such 
                                              interest related. This judicial

                                              exercise in realism and in 
                                              response to the socio-economic 
                                              changes of the times, was 
                                              exemplified in the much discussed

                                              In this case, Konklofi inherited 
                                              from his father, a subject of the 
                                              Berekusu stool, certain cocoa 
                                              farms and sugar-cane plantations. 
                                              He built a cottage on the farm and 
                                              continued the farming which his 
                                              father had started in his 
                                              lifetime. He obtained a loan on 
                                              security of the farms without 
                                              prior notice to the stool. Upon 
                                              default, the creditors obtained 
                                              judgment at the courts and sought 
                                              to attach the land under a writ of 
                                              fi.fa. A claimant interpleaded on 
                                              behalf of the stool on the grounds 
                                              that the land, being stool 
                                              property could not be seized in 
                                              satisfaction of the private debt 
                                              of a stool subject who was an 
                                              interest holder. For this to

                                              One of the principal issues which 
                                              the court had to resolve was 
                                              whether or not the stool subject 
                                              had acquired such right, title or

                                              land, so long is he entitled to 
                                              live on and to work that land. 
                                              Furthermore, the evidence shows 
                                              that Konklofi is entitled to use 
                                              his village and farms; as long as 
                                              he likes he can live in his

                                              attached, was a recognition and 
                                              restatement of the traditional law

                                              The learned Chief Justice answered 
                                              these questions affirmatively

                                              for 40 years or over and that

                                              It may be observed that the Chief 
                                              Justice's arguments have run into 
                                              certain logical problems here. 
                                              However, before dealing with the 
                                              logical defects in the argument, 
                                              it may be pointed out for the 
                                              moment that he showed, with the 
                                              greatest respect, a basic 
                                              misconception of the nature of 
                                              stool property. In terms of the 
                                              administrative controls which the 
                                              stool land administrators, the

                                              exercise over unappropriated land, 
                                              the Chief Justice may be right in 
                                              saying that the land in the 
                                              occupation of Konklofi was no 
                                              longer stool property. But in 
                                              terms of the reversionary right 
                                              which the stool retains as the 
                                              paramount title holder, the land 
                                              in the occupation of Konklofi was 
                                              still stool property and in this 
                                              sense, the Chief Justice was 
                                              wrong.</span></p>

                                              As to the logical defects in the 
                                              argument, it may be seen that the 
                                              Chief Justice laid it down that 
                                              long and uninterrupted occupation 
                                              of stool land by the subject 
                                              creates an absolute title adverse 
                                              to the stool. The basis of his 
                                              argument is that a subject can 
                                              successfully interplead in cases 
                                              where the stool land on which he 
                                              has established rights, is to be 
                                              seized in execution to satisfy 
                                              stool debt. It follows, therefore, 
                                              that the subject acquires an 
                                              absolute title over the area to 
                                              which his interest relates. But 
                                              this is a non sequitur.</span></p>

                                              The reason why the subject can 
                                              successfully interplead against 
                                              the levying of execution on stool 
                                              land over which he has established 
                                              rights is not because he has 
                                              absolute title to the land, but 
                                              because he has acquired a valuable 
                                              interest in the land; an interest 
                                              which is his exclusive individual 
                                              property and over which the stool 
                                              has no control. Thus to levy 
                                              execution on the stool land on 
                                              which such a valuable interest or 
                                              individual wealth has been 
                                              created, would amount to taking 
                                              what belongs to the individual to 
                                              pay for the debt of the stool.</span></p>

                                              It is true, as the Chief Justice 
                                              rightly observed, that if the 
                                              stool were to be in debt, Konklofi 
                                              would be expected to contribute 
                                              money in payment of the debt as 
                                              his civic obligation. But he would 
                                              not be expected to pay over and 
                                              above that which other citizens

                                              any levying of execution on the 
                                              stool land which will involve the 
                                              confiscation of the subject's 
                                              individual property acquired 
                                              without the aid of the stool 
                                              cannot be permitted under the

                                              This is what the customary law 
                                              frowns upon. It is in order to 
                                              protect individual rights in this 
                                              respect that the customary law 
                                              provides that the stool has no 
                                              right to alienate land in 
                                              possession of the subject without 
                                              his consent. It is indeed for 
                                              reasons such as those outlined 
                                              above and the operative effect of 
                                              the above rule which will make it 
                                              possible for the subject to 
                                              successfully interplead when stool 
                                              land encumbered by him is in 
                                              danger of being sold in 
                                              satisfaction of a stool debt.11 
                                              Consequently, it does not 
                                              necessarily follow that because 
                                              the subject has this right to 
                                              interplead, his user right has 
                                              evolved into absolute ownership. 
                                              Basing his conclusions on these 
                                              mistaken premises, the learned

                                              Some of the reasons given by the 
                                              Chief Justice to reinforce his 
                                              views were that while Konklofi 
                                              gave part of the produce of his 
                                              subsistence farms to the stool, as 
                                              was customarily required of a 
                                              stool subject, he performed no 
                                              such services in respect of the 
                                              land under his permanent 
                                              cultivation. He pointed out that 
                                              the stool had tacitly acknowledged 
                                              the validity of the pledge by 
                                              urging Konklofi to pay the 
                                              judgment debt in order to save the 
                                              land.13</span></p>

                                              With respect, the Chief justice 
                                              fell into the common error of 
                                              assuming that the performance of 
                                              customary service by a stool 
                                              subject is an incident of land 
                                              tenure which, in fact, it is not. 
                                              The fact cannot be over-emphasised 
                                              that the right of the subject to 
                                              beneficially enjoy an interest in 
                                              land, inheres as a result of his 
                                              membership of the corporate group 
                                              in which the absolute title is 
                                              vested. It is a right which is 
                                              independent of the giving of 
                                              customary services. Such services 
                                              may relate to political allegiance 
                                              and tax obligations, and not an 
                                              incident of tenure under customary 
                                              schemes of tenure. It would thus 
                                              be wrong to suggest that because 
                                              Konklofi was not performing such 
                                              services in respect of the land 
                                              developed by him, he had thereby 
                                              acquired an absolute title to the 
                                              land.</span></p>

                                              It does not also appear to be 
                                              logically sound to say that 
                                              because the stool urged Konklofi 
                                              to pay the debt in order to save 
                                              the land, the former necessarily 
                                              acknowledged the absolute title of 
                                              the latter. Of course, if the 
                                              purchaser was a stranger, the sale 
                                              of the farms might have the effect 
                                              of placing the reversionary 
                                              interest of the stool in danger of 
                                              being lost. For such reason, the 
                                              stool could urge the subject to 
                                              pay the debt without necessarily 
                                              implying that the latter had 
                                              acquired a title, the sale of 
                                              which would have the effect of 
                                              extinguishing altogether the title 
                                              of the stool.</span></p>

                                              earlier. In 1891, the Governor of 
                                              the Gold Coast, Sir William 
                                              Brandford Griffith, father of Sir 
                                              W. Brandford Griffith (the Chief 
                                              Justice in the present case), 
                                              asked the then Chief Justice of 
                                              the Gold Coast, J. H. Hutchinson, 
                                              to give his opinion on his 
                                              proposed Crown Lands Ordinance. 
                                              Sir Joseph Hutchinson in response 
                                              to this request, gave it as his 
                                              opinion that according to native 
                                              law, all lands in the 
                                              protectorate, whether occupied or 
                                              unoccupied, had an owner. For the 
                                              Crown to vest such lands in itself 
                                              would therefore amount to 
                                              confiscation of private property 
                                              which would be unjust.15 The 
                                              Governor did not seem to be 
                                              convinced. He thus sought a second 
                                              opinion, that of his son, the 
                                              young Brandford Griffith who had 
                                              then been transferred from the 
                                              Gold Coast to Jamaica.</span></p>

                                              The latter, in response to his 
                                              father's request, then gave an 
                                              opinion which is reflected in the 
                                              present judgment. Writing from 
                                              Jamaica in 1891 in support of the 
                                              Crown Lands Bill, he advised that 
                                              the primary objective of the Bill 
                                              should be the creation and the 
                                              establishment of freehold titles 
                                              in the traditional tenure systems. 
                                              The main reasons for his advice 
                                              were set out as follows16:</span></p>

                                              away from the towns. No doubt this 
                                              land will belong to some natives, 
                                              but what individual claims are 
                                              will be hard to ascertain. 
                                              Probably numerous persons would 
                                              each of them possess some 
                                              indefinite claim to the land. Some 
                                              of the claims will probably 
                                              conflict, and if any person 
                                              desired to purchase this land he 
                                              would experience great difficulty 
                                              in getting a secure title owing to 
                                              this indefinite and conflicting 
                                              claims. But notwithstanding that 
                                              such a tenure is inconvenient, 
                                              debars any part owner, from making 
                                              the most of the land, yet the land 
                                              undoubtedly belongs to the natives 
                                              and may seem unjust policy for the 
                                              crown to dispossess them of their 
                                              rights.&quot;</span></p>

                                              These were the learned judge's 
                                              view of customary tenure in 1891. 
                                              He thought rights in land under 
                                              customary law were indefinite and 
                                              that this resulted in insecurity 
                                              of title. He thought the system 
                                              was inconvenient and could prevent 
                                              any part owner from effective 
                                              exploitation of the land. This was 
                                              certainly a serious misconception 
                                              or the nature of individual rights 
                                              in land under the customary law. 
                                              The observation that individual 
                                              claims of right in land were 
                                              indefinite is not justifiable. 
                                              Everybody in a land-holding 
                                              community was clear in his mind, 
                                              even at the time the Chief Justice 
                                              expressed his views, where his 
                                              farm was. As the way in which 
                                              rights were established over land 
                                              in the past and at present 
                                              continues to be through land 
                                              development, it is hard to see how 
                                              claims to rights in this respect 
                                              could be said to be indefinite.</span></p>

                                              The Chief Justice was also under 
                                              the wrong impression that the 
                                              communal ownership of the land was 
                                              obstructive to individual effort 
                                              in the production of wealth. He 
                                              thus held the mistaken belief that 
                                              the system was &quot;inconvenient and 
                                              probably debars any part owner

                                              systems, the problem of insecurity 
                                              of title. But adequate research 
                                              reveals that this is not because 
                                              &quot;numerous persons would each of 
                                              them possess some indefinite claim 
                                              to the land.&quot; The basic problem is 
                                              lack of surveys and the difficulty 
                                              involved in outsiders identifying

                                              capacity to deal with land. At the 
                                              more general level, it is because 
                                              of the non-demarcation of 
                                              boundaries between the polities

                                              the Gold Coast, then thought the 
                                              opportunity had come to do away 
                                              with the &quot;wretched system of land 
                                              tenure&quot; by creating &quot;freehold&quot; 
                                              titles through the adjudicative 
                                              processes of the courts, Asante's 
                                              claim that the Chief Justice's 
                                              decision in the Lokko case was a 
                                              result of &quot;an empirical 
                                              examination of the new economic

                                              The Chief Justice was certainly 
                                              aware of the effect of the new 
                                              economic order which showed that 
                                              individuals could acquire interest 
                                              in land of potentially unlimited 
                                              duration through permanent 
                                              cultivation—a valuable interest 
                                              which could be attached in 
                                              execution of debt. It was even 
                                              capable of being used as a 
                                              security for loan. These facts 
                                              were recognised and noted in the 
                                              Lokko case. Again, the Chief 
                                              Justice in his experiences at the 
                                              courts would most probably have 
                                              been aware of the fact that most 
                                              of the concession agreements under 
                                              which mining operations on such a 
                                              large scale were going on, did not 
                                              involve absolute acquisition of 
                                              the lands encumbered by the 
                                              concessions.18 He was, therefore, 
                                              aware that whatever new economic 
                                              order might have been brought 
                                              about by these developments, were 
                                              comfortably accommodated by the 
                                              traditional system of tenure.</span></p>

                                              Thus, when he went out of his way 
                                              to overturn the land tenure system 
                                              by making his far-reaching ex

                                              occupation by a stool subject 
                                              transformed the latter's interest 
                                              into a title adverse to the stool, 
                                              he was not necessarily making a 
                                              decision based on empirical 
                                              investigation of a new economic 
                                              order to which he thought the 
                                              traditional law was obstructive. 
                                              What he seemed to be doing was an 
                                              attempt to engraft onto the 
                                              traditional schema, legal 
                                              expedients and devices which have 
                                              proved useful in European 
                                              industrialised systems of law and 
                                              which he honestly believed were 
                                              the indices of civilisation. The 
                                              Gold Coast, being under a 
                                              civilised government such as Great 
                                              Britain, ought to evolve a 
                                              freehold tenure. These were views 
                                              which the Chief Justice held and 
                                              expressed sixteen years before the 
                                              decision in Lokko v. Konklofi and 
                                              which he sought to legalise in

                                              The fact that the Chief Justice 
                                              was not alone in this view, must 
                                              also not be overlooked. He was 
                                              only echoing the predominant views 
                                              of the nascent African middle 
                                              class and elite, the European 
                                              firms, merchants and the literate 
                                              town-dwelling natives. These were 
                                              the sections of the community in 
                                              the forefront of the movement 
                                              towards individualisation of 
                                              interests. Casely-Hayford's views 
                                              on the creation of a landlord 
                                              class and the views expressed in 
                                              the Methodist Times, lend support 
                                              to this view.19 Even today, those 
                                              members of the Ghanaian society

                                              administration, like Sir Brandford 
                                              Griffith, still believe that the 
                                              evolution of the freehold interest 
                                              in the traditional schemes of 
                                              tenure constitutes an ethical 
                                              justification of property and is a 
                                              necessary condition for effective 
                                              and efficient land use. With its 
                                              emergence, it will facilitate the 
                                              acquisition of agricultural credit 
                                              from financial institutions which 
                                              could readily accept such a title

                                              It will be easily perceived how 
                                              the learned judge fell into the 
                                              same error as the court in Lokko 
                                              v. Konklofi by assuming, 
                                              erroneously, that the legal basis 
                                              of the claimant's interpleader in 
                                              this case was the twenty years 
                                              undisrupted occupation. But as 
                                              noted already, the legal basis of 
                                              their claim here was not the long 
                                              possession. The legal and ethical 
                                              justification of their claim was 
                                              what the judge found to be the 
                                              acquisition of certain valuable 
                                              rights through the development of 
                                              the land for twenty years; hence, 
                                              the individual wealth created on 
                                              the land by their unaided efforts. 
                                              The ethical reason is the 
                                              abhorrence by the customary law of 
                                              unjustificable confiscation of 
                                              individual property by the stool, 
                                              and the legal basis for the claim 
                                              is the rule that the stool has no 
                                              right to alienate land in 
                                              possession of the subject without 
                                              his consent.</span></p>

                                              attachment of land he claimed to

                                              What would appear to have escaped 
                                              the minds of the courts in the 
                                              resolution of the issues raised by 
                                              the cases is that the traditional 
                                              law is not basically concerned 
                                              with long possession. What it 
                                              emphasises is the creation of 
                                              wealth. Thus a man may by the 
                                              exercise of his inherent right 
                                              within a year acquire such 
                                              valuable interests in land in 
                                              terms of cost and value that his 
                                              interests could be regarded as 
                                              more valuable than those of 
                                              another who had been on the land 
                                              for 30 years but whose development 
                                              on the land might be insignificant 
                                              in terms of value and cost. Will

                                              justice for the courts to decide 
                                              in a case like this, i.e. in the

                                              latter has acquired an absolute

                                              validity in respect of land tenure 
                                              in West Africa,29 it would appear 
                                              that those principles guided the

                                              It was rightly argued on behalf of 
                                              the stool that such long 
                                              possession and use per se did not 
                                              under customary law, crystallise 
                                              into a title adverse to the stool. 
                                              The court upheld this contention 
                                              on behalf of the stool and 
                                              re-affirmed the customary law. The 
                                              rationale for the court's decision 
                                              was that compulsory acquisition

                                              has the effect of vesting title to

                                              acquisition which had the effect 
                                              of extinguishing such absolute

                                              elements in the Lokko case which 
                                              led Sir Brandford Griffith C.J. 
                                              and his followers to &quot;propound a 
                                              robust theory of private 
                                              ownership.” For, as he argues, the 
                                              subjects in the Owusu case had not 
                                              established any form of a 
                                              permanent cultivation on the lands 
                                              in question as had the occupants 
                                              in the previous cases. They had 
                                              farmed intermittently by shifting 
                                              cultivation in circumstances which 
                                              left the basis of their claim to 
                                              possession in some doubt.34 For 
                                              this reason, he is of the view 
                                              that the West African Court of 
                                              Appeal decision in Owusu v. Manche 
                                              of Labadi may be regarded by the

                                              landed interest to the status of

                                              But it is difficult to see how 
                                              this decision can be said to 
                                              amount to a relegation of the 
                                              subject's interest. Under the 
                                              traditional law, the subject's 
                                              right was and continues to be that 
                                              of benefit. The right is to 
                                              benefit from the community 
                                              resources, the land. Such benefit 
                                              depends on user entailing 
                                              individual effort in the 
                                              exploitation of landed resources. 
                                              It is submitted that this decision 
                                              does not derogate from the basic 
                                              principle on which these rights 
                                              are founded, and one can hardly

                                              With due deference to the author, 
                                              his criticism, of the Manche of 
                                              Labadi case and the principles of 
                                              native tenure set out in the 
                                              Tijani case as a setback to the 
                                              “realist&quot; movement in the courts, 
                                              is unjustifiable. The grounds on 
                                              which he criticises the latter 
                                              case are not dissimilar to those 
                                              on which it was castigated by both 
                                              Ollennu and Bentsi-Enchill.35 The 
                                              concept of the stool's dominium, 
                                              he argues, does not foreclose 
                                              &quot;exclusive possession of an 
                                              individual, and the Anglo-American 
                                              idea of unity of possession is 
                                              only applicable to waste lands to 
                                              which the community resorts for 
                                              fodder and other domestic items.36 
                                              Here, Asante falls into the same 
                                              error into which the previous 
                                              critics of Rayner had fallen by 
                                              regarding the subjects' user right 
                                              as a species of ownership within 
                                              the Hohfeldian legal conceptions 
                                              which defines ownership in terms 
                                              of relations between persons and 
                                              things. It is submitted that such 
                                              terms are inappropriate for 
                                              application to the customary law 
                                              interest, since they are likely to 
                                              create wrong impressions about its 
                                              real nature.</span></p>

                                              Again, the author points out that 
                                              Rayner's Report was prepared in 
                                              1898 when individual economic 
                                              resources were not substantial to 
                                              sustain the type of private 
                                              enterprise conducive to the 
                                              creation of “a regime of 
                                              individual ownership or individual 
                                              usufruct.&quot; Furthermore, Rayner, he 
                                              argues, did not recognise the 
                                              emergence of individual ownership 
                                              even in his own time, and he 
                                              over-simplified the factors 
                                              contributing to this phenomenon by 
                                              attributing it entirely to the 
                                              reception of English ideas. The 
                                              idea which appears to have escaped 
                                              many of Rayner's successors, he 
                                              thinks, is the idea that customary 
                                              law is capable of changing in 
                                              response to new conditions.37</span></p>

                                              The underlying assumption of this 
                                              argument seems to be that the 
                                              traditional schemes of interest in 
                                              land, falling short, as they do, 
                                              of absolute individual titles, was 
                                              incapable of supporting or 
                                              accommodating the kind of economic 
                                              development which was taking place 
                                              in the country at the beginning of 
                                              the twentieth century when the 
                                              decisions founded on the basis of 
                                              the principles set out in Rayner's 
                                              Report were being made. With 
                                              respect, this would be a travesty 
                                              of the true position. The success 
                                              of the cocoa industry based on the

                                              not involve absolute ownership of 
                                              land; the cultivation of the crop 
                                              on a large scale by the stool

                                              provides an antithesis to the

                                              This criticism would seem to 
                                              suggest that the law being applied 
                                              to issues relating to land tenure, 
                                              were no longer real customary law, 
                                              as practice was at variance with 
                                              the applicable law. For 
                                              contemporary socio-economic 
                                              circumstances had so undergone 
                                              such metamorphosis that the 
                                              applicable law was no longer 
                                              reflective of customary practices. 
                                              Yet, in none of the cases 
                                              discussed by the learned author 
                                              was any evidence produced to show 
                                              that the practice in land tenure 
                                              or land use patterns had changed 
                                              in a manner inconsistent with the 
                                              applicable law. Nor has any 
                                              evidence been produced to 
                                              demonstrate that the 
                                              non-recognition of absolute 
                                              individual titles based on 
                                              permanent cultivation or long 
                                              uninterrupted occupation in the 
                                              traditional systems was proving 
                                              obstructive to land exploitation 
                                              under customary schemes of tenure.</span></p>

                                              It is submitted that in so far as 
                                              the traditional system is capable 
                                              of accommodating contemporary 
                                              exploitative norms based on modern 
                                              techniques of production, any

                                              based on the traditional 
                                              conception of land as a community 
                                              asset and resource, must be 
                                              supported by cogent reasons and 
                                              empirical evidence to show that 
                                              the new change sought would prove 
                                              to be a better alternative. Unless

                                              In the discussion of questions 
                                              relating to land reform, it must 
                                              continually be borne in mind that 
                                              we are not making a law for the 
                                              urban community alone. It will be 
                                              unrealistic to suggest that the 
                                              social and economic pressures 
                                              affecting the trend towards 
                                              individualisation of interests are 
                                              not affecting the rural community 
                                              as well. But the exploitation of 
                                              landed resources continues to 
                                              occur within the family system 
                                              through co-operative efforts. In a 
                                              system where the tools of 
                                              production remain the crude and 
                                              inefficient old friends, the hoe 
                                              and the cutlass, joint efforts 
                                              will remain to be one of the best 
                                              means of land development.</span></p>

                                              the process of individualisation
