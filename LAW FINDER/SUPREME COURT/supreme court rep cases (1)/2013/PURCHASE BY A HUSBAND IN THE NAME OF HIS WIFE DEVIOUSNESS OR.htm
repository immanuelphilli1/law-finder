                                              IN the customary law of 
                                              conveyancing documents have 
                                              limited importance. An instrument 
                                              of the most formidable appearance 
                                              is, at most, evidence of a 
                                              customary-law formality.1 Even 
                                              when a transfer takes effect under 
                                              common law by a deed of 
                                              conveyance, customary law may 
                                              nevertheless override the words 
                                              identifying the grantee, so that, 
                                              for example, a conveyance to &quot;X&quot; 
                                              may take effect as a conveyance to 
                                              the family of which X is head and 
                                              from whose funds the purchase 
                                              price is provided.2 However, under 
                                              &quot;pure&quot; common law the terms of a 
                                              documentary conveyance are given 
                                              great respect. Here a deed of 
                                              conveyance to &quot;X&quot; is both 
                                              necessary and conclusive in 
                                              passing an interest to X. One of 
                                              the few qualifications to this 
                                              common-law rule is formed by the 
                                              equitable doctrines of presumed 
                                              resulting trusts.3 These do not 
                                              affect the legal interest, which 
                                              duly passes to the grantee named 
                                              in the conveyance, but they can 
                                              raise an equitable interest in 
                                              some other person intended by the 
                                              parties to take the benefit. The 
                                              question of intention—roughly, 
                                              whether it was simple generosity 
                                              or devious self-interest which 
                                              activated the person, other than 
                                              the express grantee, who provided 
                                              the consideration-may be 
                                              established by recourse to 
                                              presumption which arise in certain 
                                              circumstances, and which may be 
                                              rebutted by evidence of the actual 
                                              intention in a particular case. 
                                              Since it is not uncommon in Ghana 
                                              to purchase property in another's 
                                              name, or gratuitously to transfer 
                                              property to another, these being 
                                              the circumstances in which the 
                                              presumption of a resulting trust 
                                              arises, the increasing use of 
                                              strict common-law conveyancing has 
                                              produced a line of cases in which 
                                              resulting trusts have been alleged 
                                              to exist. The latest is Ramia v. 
                                              Ramia.4</span></p>

                                              The plaintiff had purchased a plot 
                                              of land and had had it conveyed by 
                                              the vendor to his wife, the 
                                              defendant. He had then erected a 
                                              substantial building in his wife's 
                                              name. He thereafter managed and 
                                              controlled the property. He now 
                                              sued, arguing that the defendant 
                                              held the legal title on a 
                                              resulting trust for him, and 
                                              claiming that she be ordered to 
                                              convey that title to him as the 
                                              sole beneficiary.5 Since there had 
                                              been a purchase by the plaintiff 
                                              in the name of the defendant, the 
                                              circumstances gave rise to the 
                                              initial presumption of a resulting 
                                              trust. The wife argued that this 
                                              was rebutted by the contrary 
                                              presumption of advancement, by 
                                              which a man is presumed to intend 
                                              a gift when he purchases in the 
                                              name of his lawful wife. (She 
                                              seems to have claimed that their 
                                              children also were beneficiaries, 
                                              although, since their names did 
                                              not appear on the conveyance, 
                                              there can hardly have been grounds 
                                              for applying to them the doctrine 
                                              of advancement, the sole function 
                                              of which is to rebut the initial 
                                              presumption of a resulting trust 
                                              and to cause the equitable 
                                              interest to pass with the legal. 
                                              The decision reached excluded any 
                                              need for discussion of the 
                                              point.)&nbsp; The principal issue was 
                                              whether the evidence rebutted this 
                                              presumption of advancement in 
                                              favour of the wife. The High Court 
                                              and the Court of Appeal both held 
                                              that it did not, and gave 
                                              judgement against the plaintiff.</span></p>

                                              Two Ghanaian cases were expressly 
                                              distinguished. In Kwantreng v. 
                                              Amassah6 a father had conveyed an 
                                              interest in land gratuitously to 
                                              his daughter, and in reply to a 
                                              claim of a resulting trust the 
                                              daughter had relied on the 
                                              presumption of advancement 
                                              applicable as between father and 
                                              child. Her argument was rejected 
                                              on the ground that the father's 
                                              total control and enjoyment of the 
                                              property proved that there had 
                                              been no intention of advancement 
                                              in fact. &nbsp;The resulting trust 
                                              therefore took effect. In Ussher 
                                              v. Darko7 a man had acquired 
                                              property in the name of a woman, 
                                              and in reply to a claim of a 
                                              resulting trust she sought to rely 
                                              on the presumption of advancement 
                                              as between husband and wife. It 
                                              was held that this could not arise 
                                              in favour of a woman who, as in 
                                              this case, was not the lawful wife 
                                              of the purchaser.</span></p>

                                              There have been a few other 
                                              reported cases. In&nbsp; Quartey v. 
                                              Armar8 a husband claimed that 
                                              property vested in his wife was 
                                              held on a&nbsp; resulting trust for 
                                              him. She disputed the claim on the 
                                              ground that she, and not her 
                                              husband, had provided the 
                                              consideration. She did not raise 
                                              the argument of advancement.&nbsp; The 
                                              husband succeeded as to one 
                                              property, and the other was found 
                                              to be held in trust for both 
                                              parties jointly. In Quist v. 
                                              George9 there was an unsuccessful 
                                              attempt to rely on the presumption 
                                              of advancement.&nbsp; In the 
                                              circumstances the presumption 
                                              would not have rebutted the 
                                              particular resulting trust in 
                                              issue, but in any case the 
                                              advancement alleged would have 
                                              been by a mother-in-law in favour 
                                              of her son-in-law and by a wife in 
                                              favour of her husband, neither of 
                                              which is in a category giving rise 
                                              to a presumption. In Reindorf v. 
                                              Reindorf10 a wife had purchased 
                                              property in the joint names of 
                                              herself and her husband.&nbsp; It was 
                                              held that the legal interest was 
                                              held by them jointly on a 
                                              resulting trust for the wife 
                                              alone. Again it was held that 
                                              there could be no presumption of 
                                              advancement by a wife in favour of 
                                              her husband.&nbsp; In Sasu-Twum v. 
                                              Twum11 a man had acquired two 
                                              houses in the name of his son.&nbsp; It 
                                              was held that the presumption of a 
                                              resulting trust was rebutted by 
                                              the presumption of advancement. 
                                              Finally, in Harrison v. Gray, 
                                              Jnr.12 a house purchased by a 
                                              woman in the name of her 
                                              prospective husband was held to be 
                                              subject to a resulting trust in 
                                              her favour, the possibility of a 
                                              presumption of advancement in 
                                              favour of a husband being again 
                                              denied. </span></p>

                                              In Ramia v. Ramia the Court of 
                                              Appeal cited a dictum from the 
                                              English case Re Paradise Motor Co. 
                                              Ltd.,13 as providing a convenient 
                                              summary of the rules on onus of 
                                              proof. These are essentially that, 
                                              when the circumstances give rise 
                                              to a presumption, either of an 
                                              intention to create a resulting 
                                              trust or of an intention of 
                                              advancement, the onus shifts to 
                                              the party disputing the 
                                              presumption to show an actual 
                                              intention to the contrary. The 
                                              Court of Appeal found that the 
                                              presumption of advancement in this 
                                              case was in fact confirmed by the 
                                              evidence, which showed that there 
                                              had been an orally expressed 
                                              intention to make a gift. 
                                              Consequently the issue of onus was 
                                              not decisive. However, one may 
                                              perhaps question the statement in 
                                              the leading judgment, that the 
                                              wife and children could benefit 
                                              from the presumption of 
                                              advancement &quot;provided an intention 
                                              to benefit her could be discerned 
                                              from the contemporaneous 
                                              circumstances . . .&quot; or &quot;if a 
                                              clear expression of a gift to the 
                                              wife is established.&quot; It is 
                                              submitted that, since the 
                                              presumption itself determines the 
                                              onus, it does not require to be 
                                              supported by evidence of an 
                                              intention to benefit the wife.&nbsp; 
                                              Rather, the presumption is 
                                              decisive unless rebutted by 
                                              evidence of a contrary intention.

                                              and Sasu-Twum v. Twum. The rule is 
                                              that acts of a party done after 
                                              the conveyance cannot be relied 
                                              upon to that party's advantage. 
                                              Otherwise there would be a danger 
                                              of self-serving conduct being used 
                                              to attempt to change retroactively 
                                              the effect of the conveyance, 
                                              whereas it is at the moment of the 
                                              conveyance that a resulting trust 
                                              arises or is excluded. Thus in the 
                                              present case the husband's control 
                                              of the property subsequent to the 
                                              conveyance could not contribute to 
                                              his claim of a resulting trust.</span></p>

                                              If there continue to be cases 
                                              turning on these doctrines it will 
                                              become increasingly important to

                                              peculiarly Ghanaian factors may 
                                              affect their operation. Both the 
                                              initial presumption and the 
                                              presumption of advancement were 
                                              originally conclusions about the 
                                              probable intentions of purchasers 
                                              and grantors in English social 
                                              circumstances.&nbsp; Every Ghanaian 
                                              case gives some guidance on their 
                                              applicability in Ghana. The 
                                              present case confirms that 
                                              generally all the English rules 
                                              are thought appropriate, including 
                                              those which concern personal and 
                                              family relationships.15 The 
                                              leading judgment even seems to 
                                              follow recent changes made by 
                                              English courts, as a result of 
                                              English social change, in the 
                                              weight of the presumptions.16 
                                              However it mentions that, in 
                                              determining questions of 
                                              intention, a court should take 
                                              account of the local practice 
                                              whereby a husband may control his 
                                              wife's property to enable his 
                                              expertise to be exercised in the 
                                              matrimonial interest.&nbsp; Thus it 
                                              would seem that the exercise of 
                                              control is less likely in Ghana to 
                                              indicate the holding of a 
                                              beneficial interest.</span></p>

                                              One important adaptation to 
                                              Ghanaian circumstances appears. In 
                                              every Ghanaian case hitherto in 
                                              which the presumption of 
                                              advancement between husband and 
                                              wife had been discussed, the 
                                              couple have been married under the 
                                              Marriage Ordinance (Cap. 127).17 
                                              In Ramia v. Ramia the parties had 
                                              been first married under customary 
                                              law, and subsequently, as it was 
                                              held, had contracted a valid 
                                              marriage under the Marriage of 
                                              Mohammedans Ordinance (Cap. 
                                              129).18 Edward Wiredu J. A. 
                                              expressly upheld the application 
                                              of the doctrine to parties to 
                                              non-monogamous marriages and would 
                                              have held it applicable even if 
                                              the parties' Moslem marriage had 
                                              not been proved, on the basis of 
                                              their prior subsisting 
                                              customary-law marriage.&nbsp; It thus 
                                              appears that the doctrines of 
                                              resulting trusts may come to be 
                                              more frequently applied between 
                                              parties whose relationships are in 
                                              other respects governed by 
                                              customary law, and that when this 
                                              occurs the common law is to 
                                              recognise marriages under

                                              Mohammedans Ordinance and to give 
                                              them the same effect as Ordinance

                                              However, it is submitted that in 
                                              such cases it will be necessary

                                              respect applicable to the 
                                              relationship between the parties 
                                              with regard to this property?&nbsp; It 
                                              is to be expected that frequently 
                                              all relations between persons 
                                              married under customary law will 
                                              be governed by customary law.&nbsp; 
                                              When that is the case there will 
                                              be no ground to apply the 
                                              doctrines of resulting trusts, 
                                              which are part of the common law 
                                              as distinct from customary law.&nbsp; 
                                              For example, in Abebreseh v. 
                                              Kaah,20 where a man had acquired a 
                                              house with the aid of substantial 
                                              contributions from his 
                                              customary-law wife, the court 
                                              considered only the rules of 
                                              customary law, and concluded that 
                                              the parties held the house as 
                                              customary-law co-owners: the 
                                              common-law doctrines were not 
                                              mentioned. The law seems to be 
                                              that, as between customary-law 
                                              spouses, the law applicable in a 
                                              property dispute is that which 
                                              they may be taken to have intended 
                                              to govern their transaction in 
                                              respect of that particular 
                                              property.21 If, however, on this 
                                              approach it is concluded that the 
                                              common law generally applies, the 
                                              rules of common law may still take 
                                              into account any specifically 
                                              customary-law aspects of their

                                              people sometimes acquire 
                                              properties in the names of their 
                                              children and other dependants as a 
                                              means of providing for them, 
                                              especially when the law of 
                                              intestacy is unlikely to meet 
                                              their needs22 Thus an intention to 
                                              make a gift may be more probable 
                                              in Ghana than in England.</span></p>
