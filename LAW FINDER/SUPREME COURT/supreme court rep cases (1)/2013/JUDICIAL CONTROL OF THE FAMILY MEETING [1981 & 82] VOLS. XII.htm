                                              IN the field of public law there 
                                              has been controversy over the 
                                              extent to which the courts may 
                                              pronounce upon the proceedings of 
                                              other judicial bodies which,

                                              are &quot;not to be questioned.&quot;

                                              customary-law family councils.</span></p>

                                              In Allotey v. Quarcoo1 the 
                                              plaintiff sought to question the 
                                              proceedings of a family meeting 
                                              which had allegedly removed him 
                                              from office as one of two joint 
                                              family heads. The meeting had been 
                                              properly convened to consider 
                                              deposition charges against him, 
                                              but at a certain stage there had 
                                              been angry exchanges and some 
                                              disorder, and the plaintiff had 
                                              left. The parties were in dispute 
                                              as to whether the meeting had 
                                              after his departure validly 
                                              deposed him. The trial court ruled 
                                              that on the face of the pleadings 
                                              there was one triable issue of 
                                              fact, namely &quot;whether the meeting 
                                              which allegedly removed the first 
                                              plaintiff ended abruptly or rather 
                                              came to a conclusion as required 
                                              by law.&quot; The court held that the 
                                              alleged deposition of the 
                                              plaintiff had been contrary to 
                                              customary law and was void, 
                                              because the meeting had failed to 
                                              comply with the fundamental 
                                              principles of the administration 
                                              of justice, had continued 
                                              improperly after the plaintiff's 
                                              withdrawal and had not reached its 
                                              decision on the basis of a proper 
                                              vote.2 The defendants appealed 
                                              primarily on the ground that the 
                                              decision was not confined to the 
                                              issue set down for trial. The 
                                              Court of Appeal upheld the appeal, 
                                              holding that, on the solitary 
                                              issue set down, the evidence 
                                              showed that the family meeting had 
                                              continued after the plaintiff's 
                                              departure, and had reached a 
                                              decision to depose him. The court 
                                              held: </span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

                                              &quot;In this case the propriety of the 
                                              decision reached, not having been 
                                              pleaded, was not an issue for the 
                                              court to adjudicate upon. In any 
                                              event, it is within the domestic 
                                              jurisdiction of the family to 
                                              decide on what they regard as good 
                                              grounds for deposing their head of 
                                              family, and unless there is clear 
                                              proof of substantial departure 
                                              from the tenets of natural 
                                              justice, the courts will not 
                                              interfere.&quot; </span></p>

                                              The dictum indicates the principal

                                              resolve concerning this class of 
                                              family decision. The courts might 
                                              perhaps have decided that they 
                                              would make no adjudication 
                                              whatsoever of internal family

                                              Had they done this, they would 
                                              have had to exclude from their

                                              every rule which made reference to 
                                              a head of family. This would have 
                                              excluded substantial areas of 
                                              customary property law from the 
                                              effects of state recognition and 
                                              enforcement. It would, for 
                                              example, have been necessary to 
                                              devise different rules on the 
                                              alienation of family property, 
                                              perhaps to the effect that a 
                                              purported alienation was void 
                                              unless all adult members had 
                                              concurred. The present rules, 
                                              giving a preponderant voice to the 
                                              head of family, require that the 
                                              courts determine who is head in 
                                              disputed cases. However, in 
                                              accepting this need the courts 
                                              have resolved generally to accept 
                                              without question the decision of 
                                              the family. They have then been 
                                              confronted with numbers of cases 
                                              in which litigants have found it 
                                              in their interests to argue that 
                                              the family's decision was too 
                                              unreasonable to be recognised. The 
                                              courts have not declined 
                                              altogether to listen to such 
                                              arguments, but Allotey v. Quarcoo 
                                              shows that generally they will 
                                              listen only in extreme cases, the 
                                              independence of the family being 
                                              respected in all ordinary 
                                              circumstances.</span></p>

                                              This is the latest in a line of 
                                              cases in which the identification 
                                              of the head of a family required a 
                                              decision on a disputed allegation 
                                              that a former head had been 
                                              deposed. In such cases there is an 
                                              irreducible minimum issue which a 
                                              court cannot avoid. Even if it be 
                                              asserted that a family has 
                                              unfettered discretion in deposing 
                                              a head, it is still necessary to 
                                              decide whether a head has in fact 
                                              been deposed: and this 
                                              necessitates the setting of a 
                                              legal definition of deposition 
                                              against which the particular facts 
                                              can be measured.</span></p>

                                              It would seem necessarily the law 
                                              that the party alleging a 
                                              deposition must prove the 
                                              requisite facts. So far the courts 
                                              have not held deposition to be 
                                              impossible in any system of 
                                              customary law.3 They have 
                                              indicated that the essence of 
                                              deposition is a decision of a 
                                              family meeting.4 Further 
                                              clarification of this requirement 
                                              has indicated that a &quot;family 
                                              meeting&quot; means a meeting to which 
                                              all the principal members are 
                                              invited,5 and which is 
                                              representative of the family as a 
                                              whole;6 and that &quot;decision&quot; 
                                              includes a resolution passed by a 
                                              majority vote.7</span></p>

                                              In Allotey v. Quarcoo it was 
                                              admitted that a valid meeting 
                                              occurred. The factual issue for 
                                              trial was whether that meeting 
                                              continued to the point where a 
                                              valid decision was reached. The 
                                              courts have not altogether 
                                              abstained from questioning 
                                              decisions of family meetings. 
                                              However, as Allotey v. Quarcoo 
                                              confirms, once a decision of a 
                                              family meeting is proved, the 
                                              burden of proving invalidity 
                                              shifts to the party seeking to 
                                              avoid the decision.8 There is 
                                              authority holding further that the 
                                              decision can be declared void if 
                                              it is shown to lack certain 
                                              characteristics. It has been held 
                                              that the head of family must have 
                                              been given an opportunity to 
                                              answer the charges brought against 
                                              him, by receiving due warning of 
                                              the purpose of the meeting and a 
                                              hearing at the meeting.9 
                                              Accordingly, in Allotey v. Quarcoo 
                                              a reference to &quot;the court's lack 
                                              of jurisdiction to pronounce on 
                                              the merits of the decision of the 
                                              family&quot; was followed by the 
                                              qualification that the decision 
                                              had been reached &quot;at a fully 
                                              representative meeting and after 
                                              due notice of the meeting and the 
                                              charges given beforehand.&quot; 
                                              According to some authorities it 
                                              was also essential for it to have 
                                              been established at the meeting 
                                              that the head had been guilty of 
                                              misconduct, or had become unfit 
                                              for the post.10 However, in 
                                              Allotey v. Quarcoo the court 
                                              confined the extent of legitimate 
                                              judicial concern. The trial judge 
                                              had stated that he would consider 
                                              whether there had been a violation 
                                              of any fundamental principle of 
                                              the administration of justice, 
                                              especially the rules of natural 
                                              justice. The Court of Appeal said 
                                              that in this &quot;he stated the 
                                              limited supervisory role of the 
                                              courts in family elections and 
                                              depositions a shade too broadly.&quot; 
                                              It laid down the rule that &quot;the 
                                              courts [will] interfere with the 
                                              family's decision only when there 
                                              has been a complete denial of 
                                              justice or a substantial denial of 
                                              justice.&quot;11 This is perhaps still 
                                              not the most precise specification 
                                              possible, but it nevertheless 
                                              constitutes a clarification and 
                                              determination of the law.</span></p>

                                              this was to have effect

                                              prescribed by any law.&quot;13 All 
                                              members of the Supreme Court 
                                              hearing the case accepted that the 
                                              court could not avoid determining 
                                              whether a particular act amounted 
                                              to a &quot;judicial action taken or 
                                              purported to have been taken. . .&quot; 
                                              While the court could not allow 
                                              such action to be &quot;questioned,&quot; it 
                                              had to decide whether a particular 
                                              action came within the 
                                              &quot;unquestionable&quot; category. 
                                              Similarly, even if a court were 
                                              totally excluded from questioning 
                                              the propriety of a family's 
                                              deposition of its head, it could 
                                              not avoid the need to determine 
                                              whether a family had in fact made 
                                              a deposition. The competence of 
                                              courts in the two instances 
                                              thereafter diverges. The statutory 
                                              provision in issue in Kwakye v. 
                                              Attorney-General bars all further 
                                              questions whatsoever, whereas the 
                                              customary law in issue in Allotey 
                                              v. Quarcoo allows the validity of 
                                              the act to be questioned on the 
                                              limited grounds mentioned above.</span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

                                              Another analogy may be drawn with 
                                              other types of family decisions, 
                                              those to appoint a particular 
                                              member as head and to alienate 
                                              family land. The courts appear to 
                                              have decided that when any such 
                                              act is in issue they will 
                                              ascertain whether a family 
                                              decision has been reached, but 
                                              will generally not question the 
                                              propriety of the decision. 
                                              However, there is some authority 
                                              for each category of decision for 
                                              the view that in extreme cases the 
                                              courts may hold a decision to be 
                                              void as being based on wrong 
                                              grounds.14 Thus the courts are 
                                              gradually demarcating the 
                                              boundaries of the family's 
                                              autonomy. It appears to be 
                                              far-flung, leaving few grounds on 
                                              which family decisions may be 
                                              questioned in the courts.15</span></p>
