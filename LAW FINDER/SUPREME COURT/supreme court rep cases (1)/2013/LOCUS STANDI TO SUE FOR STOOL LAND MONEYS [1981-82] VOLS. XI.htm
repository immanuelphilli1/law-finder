                                              Gyamfi v. Owusu1 arose after stool 
                                              lands had been apparently acquired 
                                              by the Government of Ghana. The 
                                              omanhene whose stool's lands were 
                                              affected withdrew the claim to 
                                              compensation made by his 
                                              predecessor in office, and 
                                              instigated three other persons to 
                                              claim on the ground that the lands 
                                              were their ancestral properties. 
                                              As a result they were paid ¢1.5m., 
                                              a substantial portion of which 
                                              they passed clandestinely to the 
                                              omanhene. The plaintiffs brought 
                                              action for money had and received 
                                              on behalf of the man against the 
                                              three recipients, and the omanhene 
                                              was joined as a co-defendant in 
                                              his private capacity. The High 
                                              Court gave judgment for the 
                                              plaintiffs, ordering the 
                                              defendants and co-defendant to pay 
                                              into court the compensation they 
                                              had received.2</span></p>

                                              apparent &quot;acquisition&quot; was 
                                              revealed, as a result of which the 
                                              appeal was allowed on grounds 
                                              which had not been examined in the 
                                              High Court.&nbsp; However, the Court of 
                                              Appeal also determined a number of 
                                              questions of more general 
                                              significance.&nbsp; This comment is 
                                              concerned primarily with these, 
                                              although for completeness the 
                                              immediate ground of the decision 
                                              will be mentioned subsequently. 
                                              The general issues fall under the 
                                              heads of two questions: first, who 
                                              is entitled to sue to recover 
                                              compensation for stool land; and 
                                              secondly, can a chief be sued for 
                                              an account of the proceeds of 
                                              stool land? </span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

                                              Were the plaintiffs competent to 
                                              sue for the compensation? The 
                                              defendants argued that by 
                                              customary law only the stool 
                                              occupant was entitled to bring an 
                                              action for stool moneys. The court 
                                              accepted that this was an 
                                              established general rule.&nbsp; In 
                                              reply, the plaintiffs relied upon 
                                              Kwan v. Nyieni,3 the leading 
                                              decision on the power to sue on 
                                              behalf of a family, which 
                                              specified a number of exceptions 
                                              to the general rule that only the 
                                              head was entitled to sue.&nbsp; The 
                                              plaintiffs argued that the holding 
                                              should be extended to actions on 
                                              behalf of stools, and that, if 
                                              this were done, they would fall 
                                              within the exception whereby other 
                                              members might sue to preserve the 
                                              corporate property if the head (or 
                                              chief) and some of the elders 
                                              failed to take the necessary 
                                              action. Charles Crabbe J.S.C., 
                                              giving the principal judgment, 
                                              seems to have been sympathetic to 
                                              the argument. Archer J.S.C., in a 
                                              briefer, concurring judgment, 
                                              doubted whether family property 
                                              could be safely equated with stool 
                                              property, and held, &quot;This court 
                                              would therefore decline the 
                                              invitation to extend the 
                                              exceptions in Kwan v. Nyieni to

                                              However, the plaintiffs' argument 
                                              foundered on a further objection 
                                              to their standing.&nbsp; The defendants 
                                              argued that everyone who might 
                                              have been competent under 
                                              customary law to sue for stool 
                                              moneys, including even the chief, 
                                              had been excluded by legislation.&nbsp; 
                                              They relied upon the

                                              (Act 123), s.17(1) of which

                                              purpose very widely.&nbsp; It provided 
                                              that the minister was to pay all 
                                              sums collected into a stool lands 
                                              account, and made provision for

                                              according to schemes to be 
                                              formulated and published for the 
                                              benefit of the localities in which 
                                              the lands were situated.4 These 
                                              provisions seemed clearly to 
                                              deprive even the chief himself of 
                                              the capacity to sue for sums such 
                                              as those in issue in this case.&nbsp; 
                                              The court had no doubt that 
                                              &quot;revenue&quot; as defined included

                                              Charles Crabbe J.S.C. discussed 
                                              the effect on these provisions of 
                                              the Constitution, 1969, art. 164. 
                                              This required the &quot;revenue&quot; from 
                                              stool lands to be paid into stool 
                                              lands account, from which 
                                              disbursements were to be made 
                                              according to schemes of the same 
                                              type as those provided for in Act 
                                              123. He held that the 1969 
                                              provisions superseded those of 
                                              1962 whenever they were 
                                              inconsistent. However, the 1969 
                                              provisions did not state who was 
                                              the proper person to collect the 
                                              &quot;revenue&quot; or to make the 
                                              disbursements, and therefore the 
                                              1962 authorisation of the minister 
                                              to perform these functions must 
                                              have remained in force. In 
                                              contrast, Archer J.S.C. held that 
                                              the 1969 provisions &quot;substituted 
                                              the Lands Commission for the 
                                              Minister&quot; in these respects. 
                                              Whichever view is correct, it 
                                              seems likely that the 
                                              Constitution, 1979, art. 190(2) 
                                              superseded the previous provisions 
                                              totally by conferring the 
                                              functions expressly on the office 
                                              of the Administrator of Stool 
                                              Lands.6&nbsp; However, it has remained 
                                              the statute-law from 1962 to the 
                                              present day that state officers 
                                              alone, not chiefs or other persons 
                                              entitled under customary law, may 
                                              sue for moneys paid or payable in 
                                              respect of stool lands. It may now 
                                              never be necessary to decide 
                                              whether the rules in Kwan v. 
                                              Nyieni should be extended to 
                                              stools. </span></p>

                                              In the present case the statutory 
                                              provisions had a curious result. 
                                              They had clearly been infringed 
                                              when money in issue had been paid 
                                              by the State to the defendants.&nbsp; 
                                              This wrongful payment was likely 
                                              to prevent the money from being 
                                              disbursed under an approved 
                                              scheme, which might have 
                                              eventually benefited the stool 
                                              community including the 
                                              plaintiffs. However, according to 
                                              the statute no-one but an officer 
                                              of the State could put matters 
                                              right by suing to recover the 
                                              money from the defendants. The 
                                              plaintiffs might perhaps have sued 
                                              the minister or the Lands 
                                              Commission to compel the 
                                              performance of their obligations 
                                              in respect of the money, but it is 
                                              not clear whether a remedy would 
                                              have been available to them.7</span></p>

                                              argument that the plaintiffs could

                                              rendered this a hypothetical 
                                              issue, but it nevertheless 
                                              received some discussion. The 
                                              court considered that the general 
                                              rule that the head of a family 
                                              could not be sued for an account 
                                              of family funds, except after he 
                                              had been removed from office, 
                                              applied to the chief.8 However, 
                                              the plaintiffs argued that the 
                                              customary law had been changed by 
                                              the Constitution, 1969, article 
                                              164 (1), which provided, &quot;all

                                              of the Stool.&quot; They contended that

                                              trustee became liable to be sued 
                                              for an account by any of the 
                                              beneficiaries.&nbsp; Although this 
                                              provision is no longer in force,9 
                                              there remain enactments declaring 
                                              lands to be held&nbsp; &quot;in trust.&quot;10&nbsp; 
                                              The court rejected the argument 
                                              largely on the ground that section 
                                              17 of Act 123, discussed above, 
                                              excluded all private actions for 
                                              &quot;revenue&quot; from stool lands. 
                                              However, Archer J.S.C. also said 
                                              in reply to the argument that 
                                              article 164(1) &quot;intended no such 
                                              thing. The article merely declared 
                                              what the customary law has been 
                                              for ages.&quot; Thus this provision, 
                                              and others analogous to it, do not 
                                              create trusts in the strict 
                                              common-law sense. They merely 
                                              declare the general principle that 
                                              the persons referred to should 
                                              exercise their powers with due 
                                              regard to the interests of those 
                                              for whose benefit they act. The 
                                              other&nbsp; interpretation would have 
                                              effected a radical change in the 
                                              land law, and possibly have 
                                              impeded the efficient conduct of 
                                              government by&nbsp; imposing extensive 
                                              and detailed obligations on 
                                              &quot;trustees&quot; which would have been 
                                              legally enforceable at the 
                                              instance of large numbers of 
                                              beneficiaries.&nbsp; </span></p>

                                              Thus the court concluded on a 
                                              number of grounds that the 
                                              plaintiffs could not sue the 
                                              defendants for this money, even on 
                                              the assumption that it had been 
                                              properly paid to the defendants. 
                                              In fact it had not been properly 
                                              paid, because of a saga of 
                                              irregularities. The three 
                                              defendants had made a collusive, 
                                              unfounded claim which should not 
                                              have been accepted.&nbsp; Even if the 
                                              co-defendant, as paramount chief, 
                                              had made the claim it should not 
                                              have been accepted because such 
                                              moneys are no longer payable to 
                                              chiefs. </span></p>

                                              There was yet a further, prior 
                                              difficulty: it was now discovered 
                                              that the land was not validly 
                                              acquired by the State.11 Evidence 
                                              from an official of the Lands 
                                              Department had stated that the 
                                              acquisition was made by a 
                                              legislative instrument under the 
                                              Wild Animals Preservation Act, 
                                              1961 (Act 43). That Act does not 
                                              confer powers of compulsory 
                                              acquisition. The officer also 
                                              apparently claimed that the State 
                                              had acted under the authority of 
                                              the State Lands Act, 1962 (Act 
                                              125).&nbsp; However, it had not 
                                              complied with the procedure 
                                              required by that Act. The court 
                                              also held that Act 125 could not 
                                              have been used to acquire stool 
                                              land because section 1 thereof 
                                              conferred the power to acquire 
                                              only &quot;any land . . . other than 
                                              land subject to&quot; Act 123.12&nbsp; With 
                                              respect, this last holding should 
                                              perhaps have been qualified. It 
                                              seems not to have been brought to 
                                              the court's attention that the 
                                              State Lands Act, 1962 (Amendment) 
                                              Decree, 1968 (N.L.C.D. 234) 
                                              empowered the State to apply Act 
                                              125 to stool land by making a 
                                              written declaration that special 
                                              circumstances existed by reason of 
                                              which it appeared expedient so to 
                                              do.&nbsp; However, despite this it 
                                              seems clear that the State had not 
                                              acquired the land in question. 
                                              Therefore no compensation had been 
                                              payable to anyone, not even to the 
                                              minister under section 17 of Act 
                                              123. </span></p>

                                              The court expressed unease at 
                                              having to reject the plaintiff's 
                                              claim, since this could have 
                                              enabled the defendants to retain 
                                              money to which they were not 
                                              entitled. After the lower court 
                                              had given judgment for the 
                                              plaintiffs, the defendants had 
                                              been compelled to pay the money 
                                              into court pending their appeal. 
                                              The theoretically correct 
                                              procedure to solve the problem 
                                              would perhaps have been for the 
                                              money to be repaid to the 
                                              defendants; for the State to have 
                                              sued them for its return on the 
                                              ground that it was held on a 
                                              constructive trust and was &quot;had 
                                              and received to the use of&quot; the 
                                              payer;13 and for the process of 
                                              acquisition and payment of 
                                              compensation to be started afresh. 
                                              The court avoided this cumbersome 
                                              and litigious course.&nbsp; It recorded 
                                              that the defendants' appeal was 
                                              allowed, but ordered that the 
                                              money should remain in court until 
                                              a valid acquisition was completed. 
                                              After this, the court indicated, 
                                              an application by the 
                                              Administrator of Stool Lands for 
                                              the money to be paid into the 
                                              appropriate stool land account 
                                              would be favourably received.&nbsp; 
                                              Thus the court sought to 
                                              unscramble the confused state of 
                                              affairs in the case, having used 
                                              it for some informative rulings on 
                                              points of law concerning payments 
                                              for stool lands. </span></p>

                                              (above note 2) two further 
                                              arguments prevailed: (1) It was 
                                              held that the immunity did not 
                                              extend to an action against the 
                                              chief for money received in his 
                                              private capacity, as for example 
                                              in his private business. However, 
                                              it is submitted that in the 
                                              instant case the co-defendant had 
                                              in fact received the money because 
                                              he was omanhene. The action was 
                                              brought against him &quot;in his 
                                              private capacity&quot; in the sense 
                                              that it was brought against him 
                                              personally, not against the oman 
                                              which he on some occasions 
                                              represented. But it was for money 
                                              received by him as omanhene. (2) 
                                              It was further held that the 
                                              immunity of the head of family and 
                                              chief did not extend to cases 
                                              where the office-holder had been 
                                              guilty of fraud.&nbsp; This is an

                                              to know whether it will be

                                              no trust in favour of, or duty to 
                                              pay the money to the plaintiffs.&nbsp;

                                              on these grounds.</span></td>
