                                              THE good and very pleasant news 
                                              that Mr. Justice Amissah has won 
                                              the 1982 Ghana Book Award for Law 
                                              for his latest book: Criminal 
                                              Procedure in Ghana as announced on 
                                              10 November 1982 by the Ghana Book 
                                              Development Council, came as no 
                                              surprise to all those interested 
                                              in the administration of law and 
                                              justice in Ghana. The 1960 
                                              Criminal Procedure Code (Act 30) 
                                              of Ghana has been subjected to 
                                              numerous amendments since it was 
                                              enacted more than twenty-two years 
                                              ago. It has therefore been very 
                                              difficult to know what the law is 
                                              at any particular point in time. 
                                              There have been occasions when 
                                              decisions of the courts have not 
                                              reflected what the statutory law 
                                              says on the issue in question. For 
                                              example, section 324 (3) of the 
                                              Criminal Procedure Code, 1960, 
                                              provided that, &quot;No appeal shall be 
                                              entertained against conviction by 
                                              an accused person who has pleaded 
                                              guilty and has been convicted on 
                                              his plea.&quot; It was on the basis of 
                                              this section of the Code that the 
                                              High Court in 1974 in the case of 
                                              Watara v. The Republic [1974] 2 
                                              G.L.R. 24 held at p. 29 that, 
                                              &quot;where the accused unequivocally 
                                              pleaded guilty, there can be no 
                                              right of appeal against 
                                              conviction.&quot; That holding by the 
                                              court was erroneous, in legal 
                                              parlance, given per incuriam, 
                                              simply because unknown to the 
                                              court, the whole of section 324 of 
                                              Act 30 had been repealed on 22 
                                              September 1971 by the Courts Act, 
                                              1971 (Act 372). This 
                                              unsatisfactory state of affairs in 
                                              the field of criminal procedure in 
                                              Ghana, brought about by numerous 
                                              amendments to Act 30, has been 
                                              expertly and neatly done away with 
                                              by the author. Thus for a

                                              of criminal procedure in Ghana,

                                              institutions which it would have

                                              Since the book was published in 
                                              1982, one would have expected that 
                                              chapter 10 of the book dealing 
                                              with Appeals and Reviews (or an 
                                              additional chapter) would have 
                                              dealt with the vexed question of 
                                              whether the courts having criminal 
                                              jurisdiction, especially the 
                                              superior courts in Ghana as 
                                              described in chapter 1 of the 
                                              book, have the power to review 
                                              decisions by the special courts 
                                              created by Decrees (i.e., A.F.R.C. 
                                              D. 3 and 23), enacted by the 
                                              military government of the Armed 
                                              Forces Revolutionary Council. This 
                                              procedural issue was not 
                                              specifically raised and discussed 
                                              by the author. For instance, 
                                              Taylor J. in the High Court on 19 
                                              May 1980, in the case of Republic

                                              that the fact that the special 
                                              tribunal set up under A.F.R.C.D.

                                              applicant, would not result in the 
                                              applicant's conviction being a 
                                              nullity but voidable. And that the 
                                              conviction founded on such 
                                              insufficient or inadmissible 
                                              evidence could not be questioned 
                                              by the review process of 
                                              certiorari. It may, however, be 
                                              conceded that the reference made 
                                              by the author in chapter 1 of the 
                                              book with regard to the power of

                                              military tribunals, may apply 
                                              mutatis mutandis to decisions by

                                              agree with the author's conclusion 
                                              at p. 13 that the courts with 
                                              criminal jurisdiction in Ghana 
                                              have supervisory powers of review

                                              category as special courts) on the

                                              that the course taken by the court 
                                              was legally wrong.&quot;</span></p>
