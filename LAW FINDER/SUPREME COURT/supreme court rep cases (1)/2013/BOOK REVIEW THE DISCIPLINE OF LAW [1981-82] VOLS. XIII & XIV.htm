                                              In dealing with the construction 
                                              of documents in Part One, Lord

                                              seekers&quot; who go by the purpose or 
                                              intent of the makers of the

                                              claims by ministers of State, 
                                              government departments, tribunals, 
                                              etc., that seek to protect their 
                                              actions under &quot;ouster clauses&quot; and 
                                              special privileges. All these must 
                                              act within the law. And so, in

                                              undertaking the business of

                                              Locus standi is the topic for Part

                                              seeking to restrain Britain’s 
                                              entry into the Common Market did

                                              Humour comes next. It is not only 
                                              what to say that matters but how 
                                              to say it. Lord Denning is aware 
                                              of this and in his book he 
                                              expresses humour in writing as he 
                                              does in speech.</span></p>

                                              by Lord Denning in his decision in 
                                              Rondel v. Worsley [1969] 1 A.C. 
                                              191 which was affirmed by the 
                                              House of Lords. And, lawyers are 
                                              advised by him to give great 
                                              thought and study to the use of 
                                              language which at p. 5 he 
                                              describes as &quot;the tools of trade.&quot; 
                                              And at p. 8, he warns counsel when

                                              words:</span></p>

                                              &quot;Remember also that, whatever the 
                                              tribunal, you must give a good 
                                              impression. Your appearance means 
                                              a lot. Dress neatly, not slovenly. 
                                              Be well-groomed. Your voice must 
                                              be pleasing, not harsh or 
                                              discordant. Pitch it so that all 
                                              can hear without strain. Pronounce 
                                              your consonants. Do not slur your 
                                              words. Speak not too fast nor yet 
                                              too slow. All these things are 
                                              commonplace but they are so often 
                                              forgotten that I warn you against 
                                              the mistakes I see made daily. No 
                                              hands in pocket. It shows 
                                              slovenliness. No fidgeting with 
                                              pencil or with gown. It shows 
                                              nervousness. No whispering with 
                                              neighbours. It shows lack of 
                                              respect. No 'ers' or 'ums.' It 
                                              shows that you are slow-thinking, 
                                              not knowing what to say next. 
                                              Avoid mannerisms like the plague. 
                                              It detracts attention. Don't be 
                                              dull. Don't repeat yourself too 
                                              often. Don't be long-winded. All 
                                              these lose you your hearers; and 
                                              once you have lost them, you are 
                                              done for. You can never get them 
                                              back—not so as to get them to 
                                              listen attentively.&quot;</span></p>

                                              of intellectual brilliance, a 
                                              vivid style of speaking and 
                                              writing and unquenchable zest for 
                                              reforming the law.&nbsp; His book 
                                              reflects these qualities.”&nbsp; And, 
                                              Lord Hailsham describes the book 
                                              as “an ebullient, readable and 
                                              vigorous defence of his own
