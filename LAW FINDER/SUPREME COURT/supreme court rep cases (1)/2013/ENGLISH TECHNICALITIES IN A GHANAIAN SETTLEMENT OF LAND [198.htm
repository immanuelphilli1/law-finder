                                              TESTATORS frequently wish to leave 
                                              interests in land not in separate 
                                              portions to individuals but to a 
                                              group of relatives together. There 
                                              are various ways of achieving this 
                                              result.&nbsp; Property may be devised 
                                              to a customary-law family as 
                                              family property, in which case 
                                              customary law determines the 
                                              membership of the group and the 
                                              mode of administration of the 
                                              property. Such a devise may be 
                                              qualified by express provisions 
                                              ousting the customary law on 
                                              particular issues, such as 
                                              provisions which specify the 
                                              membership of the family, or the 
                                              person who is to be head for the 
                                              purpose of this property, or which 
                                              vary the normal rules of 
                                              management.&nbsp; Yet another 
                                              possibility is to employ the rules 
                                              of common law to produce the 
                                              desired result, as by providing 
                                              that there shall be a trust, a 
                                              joint tenancy, a tenancy in common 
                                              or a succession of estates (a 
                                              settlement). However, it is 
                                              unusual to grant an entail, either 
                                              in possession or as a future 
                                              interest, because this estate 
                                              embodies the peculiarly English 
                                              notion of family enjoyment, 
                                              whereby only one individual in 
                                              each generation, determined by 
                                              male primogeniture, enjoys the 
                                              property to the exclusion of all 
                                              others. The novel forms of words 
                                              used by testators for these 
                                              purposes have given rise to 
                                              problems of interpretation in a 
                                              line of cases.1 The latest is

                                              The court held, following English 
                                              authorities, that where a will 
                                              used technical legal terms, it 
                                              must be presumed that the testator 
                                              intended them to carry their 
                                              technical meaning. It is to be 
                                              expected that such terms will 
                                              normally appear as a result of the 
                                              will being drafted by a 
                                              professional lawyer. The 
                                              presumption seems to assume 
                                              (reasonably, it is submitted) that 
                                              the lawyer will have used the 
                                              appropriate technical language to

                                              necessary in voluntary deeds of 
                                              conveyance. A voluntary grant 
                                              simply &quot;to X&quot; would have given 
                                              rise to a resulting use in favour 
                                              of the grantor, which the Statute 
                                              of Uses, 1535, would have 
                                              &quot;executed&quot;, that is, would have 
                                              converted into a legal estate of 
                                              the same type as the grantor's 
                                              equitable estate, and thus 
                                              rendering the grant of no effect. 
                                              The words, &quot;unto and to the use 
                                              of&quot; prevented a resulting trust 
                                              from arising, and it became the 
                                              practice to include them for 
                                              safety in all conveyances, even 
                                              those for valuable consideration. 
                                              As the court pointed out further, 
                                              the Statute of Uses, 1535, ceased 
                                              to apply in Ghana on the enactment 
                                              of the Courts Act, 1971 (Act 372), 
                                              which also brought into force in 
                                              Ghana the English Law of Property 
                                              Act, 1925, s.60 (3), which removed 
                                              the need to use words to prevent a 
                                              resulting trust from arising.3&nbsp; It 
                                              was concluded that the words 
                                              ensured that the devisees took 
                                              both legal and beneficial 
                                              interests. However, it might also 
                                              be suggested, with respect, that 
                                              the words were never necessary in 
                                              wills. The doctrines of resulting 
                                              trusts have never applied to 
                                              wills, which, because they always 
                                              consist entirely of gratuitous 
                                              grants, would have suffered 
                                              extensive and devastating 
                                              consequences if they had been 
                                              subject to the doctrines.</span></p>

                                              The most difficult question was 
                                              the effect of the remaining quoted 
                                              words. The court cited the 
                                              analogous English cases. They are 
                                              few, and they do not seem to 
                                              settle all aspects of the 
                                              question. It seems likely that 
                                              English lawyers have generally 
                                              avoided using this form of words 
                                              because it was realised that their 
                                              effect was uncertain. Wilkinson v. 
                                              Spearman4&nbsp; is very briefly 
                                              summarised in the reports. It 
                                              appears that, in construing a 
                                              devise to the testator's two 
                                              daughters and the heirs of their 
                                              bodies, the court held that the 
                                              daughters took a joint estate for 
                                              life, and that there were &quot;several 
                                              inheritances&quot; on the death of the 
                                              survivor; but during the lifetime 
                                              of the survivor she was solely 
                                              entitled by virtue of her right to 
                                              survivorship.5&nbsp; In Doe (Dec'd.) 
                                              Littlewood v. Green,6&nbsp; there was a 
                                              devise of the testator's two 
                                              nieces &quot;as joint tenants, and 
                                              their several and respective heirs 
                                              and assigns for ever.&quot; It was held 
                                              that the court could give due 
                                              effect to the words by giving the 
                                              nieces a joint tenancy for their 
                                              joint lives and the life of the 
                                              survivor with a remainder in fee 
                                              simple to them as tenants in 
                                              common in equal shares. In Forest 
                                              v. Whiteway7 the devise was &quot;to 
                                              Martha and Jane, to hold to them, 
                                              their heirs and assigns, for ever; 
                                              but in case the said Martha and 
                                              Jane shall both die without issue, 
                                              then&quot; there was to be a gift over 
                                              to others. The words following the 
                                              semi-colon indicated that Martha 
                                              and Jane were not to have the fee 
                                              simple absolute.&nbsp; The court held 
                                              that they must be intended to take 
                                              as joint tenants, and stated that 
                                              it would follow Wilkinson v. 
                                              Spearman and Doe (Dec'd.) 
                                              Littlewood v. Green.&nbsp; However, the 
                                              editorial note summarises the 
                                              decision as holding that, on the 
                                              death of the survivor, Jane, 
                                              without issue, the entire property 
                                              passed to Martha's issue to the 
                                              exclusion of Jane's devisees.&nbsp; 
                                              This entails that the remainder 
                                              was granted to the issue of Martha 
                                              and Jane, whereas if Doe (Dec'd.) 
                                              Littlewood v. Green had been 
                                              followed it would have belonged to 
                                              Martha and Jane and so Jane's 
                                              share would have passed to her 
                                              devisees.&nbsp; Wilkinson v. Spearman, 
                                              as far as the record goes, does 
                                              not seem clear on this point.</span></p>

                                              prior gift.&nbsp; These were sufficient 
                                              to dispose of the plaintiff's

                                              Littlewood v. Green in holding 
                                              that this was a remainder to the 
                                              daughters as tenants in common. 
                                              Naturally, on this view they held 
                                              an interest which would never vest 
                                              in possession in them, because it 
                                              was postponed to their life 
                                              estate. However, it would be 
                                              vested in interest during their 
                                              lifetimes, and each would 
                                              therefore be competent to dispose 
                                              of her share in this future 
                                              interest either inter vivos or by 
                                              will. At another place the 
                                              judgment says that the remainder 
                                              was to the heirs of the bodies of 
                                              the daughters, that is, to the 
                                              daughters' lineal descendants 
                                              living at the death of the last 
                                              surviving daughter. This follows 
                                              the editorial summary of Forest v. 
                                              Whiteway. It would not permit the 
                                              daughters to deal with the 
                                              remainder. The two English cases 
                                              seem irreconcilable.</span></p>

                                              It seems possible that the view 
                                              expressed in Doe (Dec'd.) 
                                              Littlewood v, Green was determined 
                                              by the rule in Shelley's case, 
                                              although the rule was not 
                                              expressly referred to. By this 
                                              rule a grant to a person (or 
                                              persons) for life followed by a 
                                              remainder to the heirs or the 
                                              heirs of the body of that person 
                                              passed to that person both a life 
                                              estate and a remainder in fee 
                                              simple or fee tail.8 Frequently, 
                                              the life estate and the remainder 
                                              merged, giving the person a fee 
                                              simple or fee tail in possession, 
                                              but this did not occur if it would 
                                              have had the effect of changing 
                                              the nature of the rights acquired 
                                              in any way. The circumstances in 
                                              the present class of cases were in 
                                              the latter category, and it is 
                                              noteworthy that it is the very 
                                              instance given as an example of 
                                              non-merger under the rule in

                                              The reason for excluding merger 
                                              was that, to enable the right of 
                                              survivorship (intrinsic to joint 
                                              tenancy) to operate, neither of 
                                              the remainders could be permitted 
                                              to vest in possession until the 
                                              survivor had died. The remainder 
                                              of the first man to die could 
                                              therefore not vest in possession 
                                              on the termination of his prior 
                                              right of enjoyment, and therefore 
                                              could not merge with it. It is 
                                              unclear why the rule in Shelley's 
                                              case was not applied in Forest v. 
                                              Whiteway. </span></p>

                                              If the argument just put is 
                                              correct, it would seem that the 
                                              rule was not applicable in 
                                              Arbenser v. Hesse. It was 
                                              admittedly part of Ghanaian law at 
                                              the time of the will.10&nbsp; However, 
                                              it applied to a will only when the 
                                              will evinced on intention to 
                                              benefit all the heirs or heirs of 
                                              the body. A Ghanaian testator 
                                              being unlikely to desire to create 
                                              an entail, the court considered 
                                              that the intention of the instant 
                                              testator had been to make a gift 
                                              to those issues of each daughter 
                                              living on her death in fee simple 
                                              as tenants in common.&nbsp; The rule in 
                                              Shelley's case being inapplicable, 
                                              that part of the judgment which 
                                              follows Forest v. Whiteway is to 
                                              be preferred.</span></p>

                                              rule is normally summarised as 
                                              providing that the words of the 
                                              remainder take effect as words of 
                                              limitation (delimiting the nature 
                                              of an estate passed to a person 
                                              specified earlier in the grant),

                                              grantor's intention. It applies to 
                                              wills as well as to grants inter 
                                              vivos, but in a will it is invoked 
                                              not by technical words of 
                                              limitation but by words which 
                                              indicate an intention to refer to 
                                              the heirs or heirs of the body.</span></p>
