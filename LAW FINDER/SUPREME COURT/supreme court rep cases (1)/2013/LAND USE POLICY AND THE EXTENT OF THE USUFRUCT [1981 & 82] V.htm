                                              Amatei v. Hammond1 contains 
                                              observations on the current 
                                              development of the usufruct (also 
                                              called the &quot;determinable title&quot;

                                              interest which a citizen of a 
                                              stool or other customary law 
                                              community acquires by the 
                                              occupation and use of vacant 
                                              communal land. These observations 
                                              concern the continuity of the 
                                              interest in circumstances of 
                                              changing land-use, and the extent 
                                              of the area over which a citizen 
                                              may acquire the interest. They 
                                              tend towards the curtailment of 
                                              the citizen's rights. This aspect 
                                              of the case raises issues of

                                              The plaintiff, a member of the 
                                              Ashanti Blohum Quarter of Osu, had 
                                              earlier farmed on the land in 
                                              dispute, which was under the 
                                              control of the mankralo of the 
                                              Quarter. Subsequently, the area, 
                                              being near the town, was divided 
                                              into building plots, and the 
                                              plaintiff then obtained an express 
                                              grant of the land from the acting 
                                              mankralo. He built on the land, 
                                              and his title was challenged by 
                                              the defendant, who claimed through 
                                              an earlier grant from a mankralo.&nbsp; 
                                              It was held that the plaintiff's 
                                              express grant was void because the 
                                              acting mankralo had been 
                                              irregularly appointed, while the 
                                              defendant had failed to do 
                                              anything on the land after the 
                                              grant to him.</span></p>

                                              The court was able to cut through 
                                              the obscurities in the earlier 
                                              dealings by reaching a decision on 
                                              two grounds based on more recent 
                                              events.&nbsp; First, it held that the 
                                              plaintiff had a better title by 
                                              virtue of his possession. 
                                              Secondly, it applied the Land 
                                              Development (Protection of 
                                              Purchasers) Act, 1960 (Act 2)3. 
                                              The plaintiff had received his 
                                              express grant and built upon the 
                                              land in good faith, and would 
                                              suffer hardship and injustice if 
                                              he were ejected.&nbsp; The court 
                                              therefore exercised its power 
                                              under the Act to protect him.&nbsp; It 
                                              was not strictly necessary to 
                                              adjudicate the plaintiff's 
                                              alternative claim to title based 
                                              on his earlier farming 
                                              activities.&nbsp; However, the court 
                                              stated that he lacked title. The 
                                              interest which he had previously 
                                              held through his farming had been 
                                              lost when the land was carved into 
                                              plots for the whole community. The 
                                              court acknowledged that this view 
                                              was contrary to Ashiemoa v. Bani4 
                                              and Donkor v. Danso,5 but 
                                              suggested that they should be 
                                              &quot;looked at again.&quot;</span></p>

                                              and protection of private property 
                                              rights; and that preferred by the 
                                              instant case, of the distribution 
                                              of land in such a manner as to 
                                              promote intensive use by as many 
                                              persons as possible.&nbsp; For the 
                                              former objective it may be argued 
                                              that both economic development and 
                                              justice require that those who 
                                              acquire usufructuary interests 
                                              should be permanently secured in 
                                              their enjoyment of the land. If 
                                              the law does this they will have 
                                              an incentive to develop the land, 
                                              since they can be confident that 
                                              they will gain the benefits of the 
                                              development.&nbsp; Moreover, the 
                                              usufruct is alienable, as the 
                                              court in Amatei v. Hammond 
                                              acknowledged, and if the land 
                                              market is to operate efficiently a 
                                              prospective investor who proposes 
                                              to purchase a usufruct and develop 
                                              the land needs also to be sure 
                                              that he will acquire an 
                                              indefeasible title. Further, it 
                                              would derogate from the customary 
                                              privileges of citizens if their 
                                              community could deprive them of 
                                              this inherent right simply by 
                                              deciding that the land should be 
                                              put to a new use. This would tend 
                                              to weaken the cohesion of the 
                                              traditional communities. For the 
                                              objective preferred by the court 
                                              it may be argued that 
                                              indefeasibility of title would 
                                              enable the usufructuary who 
                                              happens to be in occupation of 
                                              land with special potential to 
                                              &quot;hamper all future developments of 
                                              the area occupied by him,&quot; as the 
                                              court put it.&nbsp; Moreover, no 
                                              injustice or loss of reasonable 
                                              expectations need ensue from the 
                                              termination of his interest, since 
                                              he would be entitled to one of the 
                                              building plots carved out of the 
                                              land, or to alternative farmland.&nbsp; 
                                              Indeed, it may be unjust to allow 
                                              an individual to enjoy the 
                                              enhancement in value of his land 
                                              which he has not himself produced.</span></p>

                                              These are the possible policy 
                                              arguments. The legal authorities 
                                              have held frequently that, as a 
                                              general rule, a community may not 
                                              grant to another rights in land 
                                              occupied by a usufructuary.6&nbsp; A 
                                              number of cases hold that the 
                                              general rule applies in the 
                                              particular circumstance of a 
                                              change in land use, such as the 
                                              conversion of rural land into 
                                              outskirt land or the adoption of a 
                                              layout for orderly development.7 
                                              However, the contrary view has 
                                              been held in two cases8 and is 
                                              expressed by Professor Kludze for 
                                              the northern Ewe.9 There has also 
                                              been a slender line of cases 
                                              holding that a stranger who 
                                              purchases land from a community 
                                              may dispossess a member in 
                                              occupation on payment of 
                                              reasonable compensation.10&nbsp; Thus, 
                                              while the weight of the 
                                              authorities seems to support the 
                                              indefeasibility of the usufruct, 
                                              they are not unanimous.</span></p>

                                              It is suggested that an analysis 
                                              of the function of the courts in 
                                              establishing the rules of 
                                              customary law may perhaps clarify 
                                              the nature of the decision which 
                                              will soon fall to be taken.&nbsp; 
                                              Decisions of the courts on 
                                              customary-law issues are in theory 
                                              based upon the customary rules 
                                              observed by the people. The 
                                              popular practice in the present 
                                              area may be discerned from a 
                                              consideration of the evidence 
                                              given in the cases and general 
                                              social factors.&nbsp; Generally, no 
                                              doubt, people recognise that it is 
                                              in the general interest to 
                                              maintain indefeasible the rights 
                                              of citizen usufructuaries. 
                                              However, it seems likely that in 
                                              certain circumstances a community 
                                              may decide that it would be of 
                                              general benefit for certain land 
                                              to be taken from citizens and put 
                                              to new uses. It is clearly 
                                              possible for the usufructuaries 
                                              concerned to accede individually 
                                              to requests to surrender their 
                                              interests. It is likely, 
                                              therefore, that such requests will 
                                              sometimes be made, and will be 
                                              discussed between the parties.&nbsp; 
                                              However, the notion of 
                                              negotiations between free and 
                                              utterly independent parties is 
                                              hardly likely to provide an 
                                              accurate characterisation of these 
                                              discussions. There will always be 
                                              some pressure on the usufructuary 
                                              to accede. In some circumstances 
                                              the pressure may be eminently 
                                              resistible, as when a large 
                                              section of the community can be 
                                              persuaded that their individual 
                                              rights will be at risk on future 
                                              occasions if the proposal is 
                                              accepted, and that little is to be 
                                              gained by taking the land.&nbsp; In 
                                              other cases the pressure may be 
                                              irresistible, such as when the 
                                              community is generally unanimous 
                                              behind its leaders in desiring the 
                                              surrender, there are strong and 
                                              obvious benefits to be gained by 
                                              the community, and the 
                                              usufructuary is offered generous 
                                              compensation. In terms of rules, 
                                              therefore, there may be classes of 
                                              circumstances when it is generally 
                                              thought right, or reasonable, or 
                                              even obligatory, for the 
                                              usufructuary to accede; in terms 
                                              of practice, it may be possible to 
                                              say that in such circumstances he 
                                              always does.</span></p>

                                              The orthodox theory of customary 
                                              law, that the courts &quot;apply&quot; 
                                              existing customary law, cannot 
                                              hold in such situations.&nbsp; A court 
                                              cannot reproduce the complex 
                                              negotiations and subtle social 
                                              pressures which would determine 
                                              the outcome if there were no 
                                              courts.&nbsp; A court always has to 
                                              give judgment for one side or the 
                                              other, and to place the power of 
                                              the state on that side.&nbsp; In the 
                                              present class of cases it has 
                                              either to decide that the 
                                              usufructuary still holds his 
                                              interest, or that the interest has 
                                              ceased—and in either case to 
                                              ensure that the decision is 
                                              effective. If the proposed 
                                              analysis is correct, the courts 
                                              have to make law on this 
                                              subject.11 If, as has been 
                                              suggested, the authorities are not 
                                              yet conclusive, the courts still 
                                              have some discretion in 
                                              determining what the law is to be. 
                                              The immediate arguments on each 
                                              side have been mentioned.&nbsp; They 
                                              seem to reflect differing views of 
                                              the type of social ordering to be 
                                              desired in Ghana.</span></p>

                                              In Amatei v. Hammond the court 
                                              also discussed a related problem. 
                                              The citizen acquiring by implied 
                                              or express grant vacant communal 
                                              land for his farming activities 
                                              has not normally been limited in 
                                              the area of land he might acquire. 
                                              Given a reasonable abundance of 
                                              vacant land, and technologically 
                                              simple farming methods, this 
                                              presented no problem. These 
                                              factors are no longer always 
                                              present.&nbsp; The court stressed the 
                                              possibilities of commercial, 
                                              mechanised farming, and said: &quot;If 
                                              . . .a person with the necessary 
                                              resources and equipment is 
                                              permitted to rely on this inherent 
                                              right to clear miles and miles of 
                                              stool land, it would not be long 
                                              when other subjects of the same 
                                              stool would be deprived of any 
                                              share of the land.&quot; It suggested 
                                              that the commercial, mechanised 
                                              farmer should be required to 
                                              obtain an express grant in the 
                                              form of a lease, and that the 
                                              community might then decline to 
                                              give him as much land as he might 
                                              request.</span></p>

                                              Here the policy conflict seems to 
                                              be primarily between the objective 
                                              of passing land immediately into 
                                              the control of those who will 
                                              develop it, and the objective of 
                                              an equitable distribution even at 
                                              the cost of delay in land 
                                              utilization. Behind this is the 
                                              conflict between the development 
                                              of capital-intensive farming in 
                                              large units, and of farming by 
                                              large numbers of small-holders. 
                                              There may also be a fear that the 
                                              citizen who acquires an inordinate 
                                              area may hoard it for speculative 
                                              purposes. Another consideration 
                                              may be that, once land is acquired 
                                              by citizen usufructuaries, it 
                                              ceases to be available for 
                                              transfer to strangers by grants 
                                              which can result in payments 
                                              benefiting the community.</span></p>

                                              Again it seems that the 
                                              authorities leave room for 
                                              discretion. Although there are 
                                              cases asserting that an express 
                                              grant is not normally required for 
                                              farming, and that no limits may be 
                                              placed on the citizen's right,12 a 
                                              number of cases from areas where 
                                              land was in strong demand have 
                                              asserted that express grants were 
                                              required.13 A decision of the 
                                              Supreme Court in 1963 asserts that 
                                              it was never the law that a 
                                              citizen might freely farm &quot;as far 
                                              as his cutlass could carry him.14 
                                              When express grants are made, they 
                                              frequently take the form of 
                                              common-law leases, although it has 
                                              been strongly argued that the 
                                              terms of such leases are 
                                              ineffective in so far&nbsp; as they 
                                              purport to restrict the 
                                              customary-law rights of the 
                                              citizen.15 Perhaps this is another 
                                              class of situation in which the 
                                              rules in practice are flexible, 
                                              leaving room for complex 
                                              assessments to prevail according 
                                              to what is deemed reasonable in 
                                              various circumstances. Here, some 
                                              at least of the difficulty arises 
                                              from modern developments. And here 
                                              also the courts may soon have to 
                                              perform their function of 
                                              establishing rules of customary 
                                              law for application in the courts. 
                                              If Amatei v. Hammond is an 
                                              indicator of the future, the 
                                              courts will here also prefer some 
                                              measure of equality to development 
                                              through unrestrained free 
                                              enterprise in the accumulation of 
                                              individual property. The usufruct, 
                                              which has been regarded by some as
