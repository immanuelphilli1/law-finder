                                              SUMMARY proceedings under Order 
                                              14,1 are devised to obviate the 
                                              necessity for a full trial when 
                                              the claim can be said to be 
                                              effectively beyond dispute. 
                                              According to rule 1 of Order 14, 
                                              after appearance has been entered 
                                              to a writ of summons especially 
                                              endorsed with2 or accompanied by a 
                                              statement of claim, the plaintiff 
                                              can move the court for judgment on 
                                              his claim provided the claim does 
                                              not fall within the exclusionary 
                                              clause of Order 14, r.13.3&nbsp; One is 
                                              thus spared the time and cost of 
                                              going the whole hog of pleadings 
                                              and trial.4&nbsp; A problem arising 
                                              under this provision, and which 
                                              this comment seeks to discuss, is 
                                              whether in such a proceeding under 
                                              Order 14 the defendant can 
                                              preclude summary judgment by 
                                              relying on a counterclaim which is 
                                              not in any way connected with, but 
                                              exceeds the plaintiff's claim.&nbsp;
                                              </span></p>

                                              Undoubtedly it would not conduce 
                                              to justice to allow recovery of a 
                                              claim which had been controverted 
                                              without the issue thereby raised 
                                              being determined. But it is 
                                              completely a different thing, and 
                                              certainly unjustifiable in our 
                                              present judicial system, to 
                                              sustain the view that where the 
                                              defendant sets up a counterclaim 
                                              which has no connection with, but 
                                              overtops the plaintiff's claim, 
                                              the right to summary judgment 
                                              should be refused.&nbsp; Should the 
                                              plaintiff, suing as a head of 
                                              family to recover an admitted 
                                              purchase price of family land be 
                                              denied summary judgment just 
                                              because long before the sale and 
                                              the appointment of the plaintiff 
                                              as head of family he allegedly 
                                              libelled the defendant?&nbsp; Should 
                                              the fact that the defendant's 
                                              counterclaim for defamation 
                                              exceeds the plaintiff's demand 
                                              make any material difference? This 
                                              would certainly be vexatious.

                                              Inspector-Plastico's case. But the 
                                              grounds of the Court of Appeal's 
                                              decision cast doubt on the

                                              case, and therefore call for a 
                                              detailed examination of these two 
                                              cases. Before an attempt is made 
                                              to demonstrate the ground on which 
                                              these two cases can be reconciled 
                                              with a view to determining the 
                                              principles enunciated in them, it 
                                              may be worthwhile to examine 
                                              briefly the concept of

                                              plaintiff by means of a 
                                              counterclaim had been re-enacted, 
                                              reinforced and amplified by the

                                              Counterclaim therefore embraces 
                                              both the set-off and other claims. 
                                              Every set-off is a counterclaim, 
                                              but not every counterclaim is a 
                                              set-off.&nbsp; Essentially, a 
                                              counterclaim is a cross-action;

                                              to admit the claim of the 
                                              plaintiff and simultaneously, 
                                              subject to the power of the court

                                              The problem presents itself in an 
                                              acute form when the value of the 
                                              subject-matter of the counterclaim 
                                              exceeds the value of the

                                              ought to be tried or that there 
                                              ought for some other reason to be 
                                              a trial of that claim.&quot;25 It might 
                                              appear from this short analysis 
                                              that the court would be inclined 
                                              to try an otherwise uncontroverted 
                                              claim only when there is an 
                                              equitable set-off.&nbsp; But equitable 
                                              set-off does not cover situations 
                                              where the defendant sets up a 
                                              counterclaim which&nbsp; is not 
                                              connected with, but merely exceeds 
                                              the plaintiff's claim.&nbsp; The 
                                              problem then is whether the 
                                              defendant has set up a 
                                              counterclaim, albeit larger than 
                                              the plaintiff's claim, which can 
                                              be brought within his provision. 
                                              For reasons which will appear 
                                              hereafter, the courts have treated 
                                              such Order 14 applications 
                                              involving unresolved questions of

                                              the defendant admitted certain

                                              amount of £100 but set up a

                                              amount.&nbsp; The court held that the 
                                              plaintiff was not entitled to

                                              counterclaim, which might turn out 
                                              to be larger in amount. The 
                                              particulars of the counterclaim do 
                                              not appear in the judgment. Given 
                                              the sparseness of the report it 
                                              may be questioned whether the 
                                              ruling could, for example, entitle 
                                              a defendant to leave to defend a 
                                              claim for ¢10,000 special damages 
                                              for the price of goods sold and 
                                              delivered to him, merely because 
                                              he enters a counterclaim for 
                                              ¢10,000 general damages for a 
                                              defamation alleged to have been 
                                              committed by the plaintiff long 
                                              after the delivery of the goods. 
                                              Yet this appears to be the 
                                              implication of the argument 
                                              presented by counsel for the 
                                              defendant-appellant.</span></p>

                                              was found that the provision was

                                              claim nor the counterclaim could 
                                              be held established32 unless it 
                                              was determined on the merits by

                                              Court of Appeal erred in holding 
                                              that a claim can only be 
                                              established by the adduction of

                                              done under Order 14.&nbsp; Even with a 
                                              counterclaim nothing prevents the 
                                              defendant in an appropriate case 
                                              from proceeding under Order 14, 
                                              r.12 of L.I. 1129 for a summary

                                              the counterclaim can be 
                                              established by an affidavit 
                                              evidence. When summary judgment is

                                              be apposite.33 It therefore 
                                              appears that the ambit of the 
                                              principle enunciated in the 
                                              judgment can only be discerned 
                                              from the facts of the case. &nbsp;The 
                                              plaintiff caused a writ to be 
                                              issued specially endorsed with a 
                                              claim for ¢72,550.77 being the 
                                              price of goods sold and delivered 
                                              to the defendant.&nbsp; The plaintiff 
                                              then sought leave to enter 
                                              judgment against the defendant 
                                              under Order 14, r.l. This was 
                                              countered by the defendants with 
                                              an affidavit in opposition filed 
                                              by the managing director of the 
                                              defendant company, who deposed 
                                              that &quot;the only amount the 
                                              defendant company admits owing to 
                                              the plaintiffs is N¢12,792.08 but 
                                              the plaintiffs owe the defendant a 
                                              much bigger amount for which the 
                                              defendants intend to 
                                              counterclaim&quot;.&nbsp; The defendants had 
                                              leave to counterclaim for the sum 
                                              of N¢200,000 being unliquidated 
                                              damages for &quot;breach of promise.&quot;34 
                                              The trial court allowed the 
                                              plaintiffs-respondents to sign 
                                              judgment for the amount admitted, 
                                              the counterclaim notwithstanding; 
                                              judgment was also entered for the 
                                              disputed amount with a stay of 
                                              execution.&nbsp; </span></p>

                                              On appeal, it was observed that 
                                              the counterclaim of the defendants 
                                              appellants was raised as a defence 
                                              to the plaintiffs respondents' 
                                              claim.&nbsp; The defendants contended 
                                              that the respondent company were 
                                              in breach of contract and were 
                                              liable in damages to them (the 
                                              defendants).&nbsp; The Court of Appeal 
                                              stated that it did not wish to 
                                              express any opinion&nbsp; &quot;on the 
                                              merits of the counterclaim and 
                                              could say no more than that there 
                                              is a chance of it succeeding. We 
                                              think, like the judge, that that 
                                              claim was at least plausible.&quot;35 
                                              The order of the High Court 
                                              granting leave to sign immediate 
                                              judgment was therefore set aside.&nbsp; 
                                              The Court of Appeal was also of 
                                              the opinion that since the 
                                              counterclaim was only controverted 
                                              in the affidavit of the 
                                              plaintiffs' solicitor who did not

                                              judgment could have been dismissed

                                              the application for summary 
                                              judgment on this ground would have 
                                              been unexceptionable. However, the 
                                              reference to Court v. Sheen and 
                                              the wide proposition emanating 
                                              therefrom was rather unfortunate.&nbsp; 
                                              The authority of the decision is 
                                              further vitiated by the fact that 
                                              the issue was not fully argued, 
                                              since there was no appearance for 
                                              the plaintiffs -respondents.&nbsp; What 
                                              is more, Court v. Sheen on which 
                                              the Court of Appeal relied for 
                                              this astonishingly&nbsp; wide 
                                              proposition had been doubted by 
                                              the English Court of Appeal.36&nbsp; 
                                              The principle, it is submitted, is 
                                              that leave to defend a claim under 
                                              Order 14 should be granted only 
                                              when the counterclaim raises an 
                                              arguable or triable issue.&nbsp; Where, 
                                              on the other hand, the 
                                              counterclaim cannot in law or 
                                              equity operate as a defence37 but 
                                              merely asserts a demand to a 
                                              payment in excess of the claim of 
                                              the plaintiff, there would be no 
                                              triable issue, and it would not 
                                              conform with principle to deny the 
                                              plaintiff's right to immediate 
                                              judgment.</span></p>

                                              that the counterclaim did not 
                                              relate to the subject-matter of 
                                              the agreement in which case his

                                              if one looks at the evidence it is 
                                              sufficiently plain that the whole 
                                              of the counterclaim does relate to 
                                              the same subject-matter as the

                                              It therefore becomes imperative to 
                                              establish some nexus between the 
                                              claim and counterclaim.&nbsp; In

                                              counterclaim was for libel.&nbsp; The 
                                              counterclaim was found to be 
                                              completely unconnected with the 
                                              original cause of action and could

                                              summary judgment.&nbsp; A counterclaim 
                                              which is entirely foreign to the 
                                              original cause of action can 
                                              hardly be a defence in law or

                                              respect, and merely advances a 
                                              fresh claim which does not emanate 
                                              from the same facts as the 
                                              plaintiff's claim, there will be 
                                              two uncontradicted, distinct and 
                                              independent claims.&nbsp; It will be 
                                              observed that as immediate 
                                              judgment on such a claim will 
                                              rather expedite litigation and

                                              provided by Order 14, r.3.45 In

                                              the report was short and did not 
                                              disclose the ground of the

                                              counterclaim was in excess of the 
                                              original claim was therefore of no

                                              discretion to refuse an 
                                              application for summary judgment 
                                              only when there is an arguable or 
                                              a triable issue.&nbsp; For the 
                                              fundamental right to trial does 
                                              not vest one with the right to

                                              non-existent issues.&nbsp; The 
                                              imposition of absolute mandatory

                                              However, since the overriding

                                              be consistent with the letter of

                                              45. This rule has been modified by 
                                              the new Order 14, r.3 of L.I. 1129 
                                              which provides by rule 3 (1) that 
                                              &quot;A defendant may show cause 
                                              against the application by 
                                              affidavit or otherwise to the 
                                              satisfaction of the Court.&quot; This 
                                              provision does not exclude 
                                              reliance on a statement of defence 
                                              in resisting an application for 
                                              summary judgment.&nbsp; But when a 
                                              statement of defence is so used, 
                                              the court could exercise its 
                                              discretion and allow the defendant 
                                              to be examined on oath.&nbsp; This view 
                                              is in tune with the Court of 
                                              Appeal's decision in Wilson v. 
                                              Smith [1980] G.L.R.D. 14 which 
                                              impliedly overrules Mansah v.

                                              by acceptance of bills of exchange 
                                              do so not simply upon the basis

                                              purchaser so that the vendor must

                                              under the contract of sale. The
