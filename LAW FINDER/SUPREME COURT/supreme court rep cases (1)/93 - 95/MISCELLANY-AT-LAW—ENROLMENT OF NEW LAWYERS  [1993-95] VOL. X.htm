                                              In 1958, when the Law School was 
                                              established, there were over 120 
                                              admissions. At the end of the 
                                              five-year course, only nine passed 
                                              and were enrolled in this hall in 
                                              1963. You will observe that if 
                                              only nine passed then the rest, 
                                              like sowing seeds, either fell by 
                                              the wayside and were choked by 
                                              thorns or fell on rocky ground. 
                                              The results stemmed from the fact 
                                              that at its inception, the 
                                              conditionalities for admission 
                                              were made as liberal as possible 
                                              to enable as many students who 
                                              wished to become lawyers to be 
                                              trained. The first batch was a 
                                              mixture of young and old persons.</span></p>

                                              Today, the qualifications for 
                                              admission are stricter and 
                                              stringent—a university degree is a 
                                              sine qua non. The period of 
                                              training remains five years and we 
                                              have just enrolled 78 new 
                                              lawyers—nearly ten times the 
                                              number enrolled in 1963. From 1963 
                                              to 1993 the Law School has trained 
                                              successfully 1,178 lawyers in 
                                              addition to 516 post-call 
                                              candidates who trained abroad, 
                                              making a grand total of 1,694 for 
                                              the past 30 years—an average of 57 
                                              lawyers per year. This is not a 
                                              bad performance and our gratitude 
                                              must go to the founding fathers of 
                                              the Law School who, with foresight 
                                              and imagination, have made this 
                                              achievement possible. This morning 
                                              we have welcomed into our 
                                              fraternity 78 new lawyers.</span></p>

                                              wish to stress that by choosing to 
                                              become lawyers, they have taken 
                                              the right decision. Unlike novices 
                                              of an Order in a monastery, they 
                                              have not been requested to take 
                                              any vows of poverty or chastity. 
                                              The General Legal [p.2] Council 
                                              has only demanded from them an 
                                              undertaking to comport themselves 
                                              as lawyers in strict compliance 
                                              with the professional code 
                                              ethics—a subject which they have 
                                              been taught in the lecture room. 
                                              It is now up to the new lawyers to 
                                              give practicality to the code of 
                                              ethics in their practice of the 
                                              law. Their life-styles and private 
                                              lives are not the concern of the 
                                              General Legal Council. But they 
                                              should remember that in the 
                                              civilized world there is an ideal 
                                              called &quot;good morality.&quot; Our own 
                                              Parliament has recognised this 
                                              quality and in section 46(3) of 
                                              the new Courts Act, 1993 (Act 459) 
                                              has emphasised the need for 
                                              panelists who will serve the 
                                              tribunals to be persons of &quot;high 
                                              moral character and proven 
                                              ability.&quot; I will not attempt to 
                                              define what is meant by &quot;high 
                                              moral character&quot; because my 
                                              definition may differ from that of 
                                              a philosopher or a rationalist. 
                                              Perhaps it will not be out of 
                                              place to suggest that “high moral 
                                              character.&quot; means good character 
                                              as opposed to bad character.</span></p>

                                              My advice to the new lawyers is 
                                              that as they have joined an 
                                              honourable profession, one would 
                                              expect them to behave with honour 
                                              and dignity. One would expect them 
                                              to have good character. Indeed, it 
                                              is one of the criteria for judging 
                                              or assessing the suitability of a 
                                              person to be enrolled as a lawyer. 
                                              Passing the examination is one 
                                              thing, whether the person's 
                                              character justifies his enrolment 
                                              is another. The Legal Profession 
                                              Act, 1960 (Act 32) as amended 
                                              clearly lays down that the person 
                                              to be enrolled must be of good 
                                              character. Please do not therefore 
                                              take it for granted that because 
                                              the council has not alerted 
                                              security agencies to investigate 
                                              your character, you are immune 
                                              from any future disciplinary 
                                              action. If you behave contrary to 
                                              the precepts of the profession, 
                                              the disciplinary committee of the 
                                              General Legal Council will deal 
                                              with your alleged misbehaviour and 
                                              may suspend you from practice or 
                                              disbar you. You are at the 
                                              threshold of your new career and

                                              You have been enrolled in a very 
                                              important historic period. A new 
                                              Constitution is in force and a new 
                                              Courts Act has been enacted. As 
                                              lawyers, one would expect you to 
                                              have the provisions of the 
                                              Constitution and the Courts Act, 
                                              1993 at your finger tips. You were 
                                              lectured on constitutional law 
                                              while at the university in your 
                                              undergraduate days. At that time, 
                                              the new Constitution had not been 
                                              enacted and your lecturers could 
                                              not have dealt with it. It is now 
                                              up to you to lecture yourselves on 
                                              the new Constitution and to be 
                                              fully prepared to give sound and 
                                              reliable advice whenever your 
                                              future clients call on you for 
                                              consultation. The need for legal 
                                              services will continue to grow in 
                                              all sectors of Ghana's economy. 
                                              Moreover the Constitution has 
                                              highlighted the indispensability 
                                              of the provision of legal aid for 
                                              indigents. The legal aid programme 
                                              can only succeed if lawyers 
                                              participate in the programme. One 
                                              area with which you will 
                                              constantly be dealing is 
                                              violations of the Constitution, 
                                              especially breaches of fundamental 
                                              human rights. The Constitution is 
                                              only eleven months old and the 
                                              intricacies of its provisions are 
                                              now being unravelled through court 
                                              actions. It is a healthy sign for 
                                              the [p.3] future democratic 
                                              process we are all yearning for.</span></p>

                                              of lawyers locally trained. In the 
                                              early sixties, I was requested by 
                                              the late Sir Arku Korsah, then 
                                              chairman of the General Legal 
                                              Council, and the late Sir Leslie 
                                              McCarthy to prepare a memorandum 
                                              on the manpower needed to provide 
                                              legal services for the general 
                                              public. I used my imagination and 
                                              suggested that the country would 
                                              require about 1,000 lawyers during 
                                              the next ten years to provide 
                                              legal services to the government, 
                                              local government, commerce and

                                              time was an overestimate because 
                                              at the end of the ten years, ie in 
                                              1973, only one-third of my 
                                              estimate had been trained for

                                              young lawyers can earn their 
                                              living without hanging around in 
                                              the regional capitals waiting for 
                                              clients and briefs from senior 
                                              lawyers. There will be plenty of 
                                              work in these community tribunals 
                                              and the opportunity to establish a 
                                              successful practice should not be 
                                              missed. Conditions in the rural 
                                              areas may not be ideal but as 
                                              pioneers in legal practice in 
                                              these new community tribunals, you 
                                              should be prepared to make 
                                              sacrifices and forgo the vain 
                                              luxuries of the urban centres.</span></p>

                                              Before 1958 every student who 
                                              wanted to qualify as a lawyer was 
                                              compelled to go abroad, especially 
                                              the United Kingdom, to train. We 
                                              should all imagine the total cost 
                                              that would have been involved if 
                                              the 69 students locally qualified 
                                              today had been trained abroad. We 
                                              should all be grateful to past 
                                              governments and the present 
                                              government for providing the 
                                              necessary subvention and 
                                              facilities for the training of 
                                              lawyers locally. The Ghana School

                                              carried our disagreements. But 
                                              what is, however, true is that in 
                                              accordance with the best tradition 
                                              of our profession both the Chief 
                                              Justice and the association have 
                                              not allowed our disagreements to 
                                              blind or colour our judgment. Both 
                                              of us have sought mutual 
                                              co-operation. The doors of His 
                                              Lordship the Chief Justice have 
                                              remained open to the association, 
                                              particularly its officers, and 
                                              without any insistence on 
                                              protocol. He has heard quite a 
                                              number of complaints, suggestions 
                                              and recommendations from the 
                                              association, even if we have not 
                                              been able to carry him with us on 
                                              each occasion. He has also been 
                                              very [p.5] supportive of the 
                                              programmes, particularly some new 
                                              initiatives of the association and 
                                              has insisted that the association 
                                              should set itself and maintain 
                                              high standards in order to enhance 
                                              the dignity, image and income of 
                                              its members. Hearty welcome!</span></p>

                                              The Honourable Ag 
                                              Attorney-General, Dr Obed Yao 
                                              Asamoah, is in farmiliar 
                                              surroundings. Admittedly, this is 
                                              the first time over a decade that 
                                              he has joined us at our annual 
                                              conference. But he is no stranger 
                                              to the association. Having taught 
                                              some of us, engaged in strenuous 
                                              private practice, previously 
                                              served as the president of the 
                                              Volta Region branch of the 
                                              association and a member of our 
                                              General Council, the association 
                                              welcomes him and hopes that his 
                                              intimate knowledge of the 
                                              association and the legal 
                                              profession would be an asset for 
                                              him to understand and rectify the 
                                              numerous problems, difficulties, 
                                              deprivations and shortcomings of 
                                              the profession and that that 
                                              intimate knowledge would not 
                                              become a tool for its destruction. 
                                              I may presently address some other 
                                              concerns of the profession to the 
                                              Honourable Ag Attorney-General. 
                                              For the moment, let me recall the 
                                              remarks of a judge who welcomed a 
                                              former Provisional National 
                                              Defence Council (PNDC) Secretary 
                                              back to court with the words that 
                                              &quot;if all fail you, the Bar will 
                                              not.&quot; This underscores the fact 
                                              that we all have a common heritage 
                                              in the law and have to protect and 
                                              defend it. You are welcome!</span></p>

                                              We are particularly happy that our 
                                              colleagues from the Togo Bar 
                                              Association are able to join us 
                                              today. It is a refreshing 
                                              knowledge that co-operation 
                                              between members of the legal 
                                              profession in different countries 
                                              in the West African sub-region, 
                                              and indeed throughout Africa, can 
                                              start from the grassroots and not 
                                              necessarily from the top. 
                                              Recently, both the print and 
                                              electronic media carried the news 
                                              of the courtesy call by Mr Yaovi 
                                              Agboyibor, a lawyer and the leader 
                                              of the parliamentary opposition in 
                                              Togo, on President Rawlings in 
                                              which he was described as the 
                                              Secretary-General of the 
                                              Association of West Africa Bar 
                                              Associations. Regrettably, the 
                                              Ghana Bar Association does not 
                                              know about the existence of that 
                                              association, nor about the visit 
                                              of Mr Agboyibor. Neither did Mr 
                                              Agboyibor find the time or think 
                                              it desirable to call on and hold 
                                              discussions with our association. 
                                              It is said in Ewe that Ne klo yi 
                                              nugbe la, abobo gboe wodze na 
                                              meaning that “when the tortoise 
                                              travels, he lodges with the 
                                              snail.&quot; Obviously, both of them 
                                              are shell animals. It must, 
                                              however, be said that this is not 
                                              the first such contact between our 
                                              two National Bar Associations. In 
                                              1989 the Togo Bar sent a 
                                              delegation to Ghana to express its 
                                              sympathies and support to our 
                                              association during those very 
                                              difficult and traumatic times. It 
                                              also invited and received a 
                                              Ghanaian team at its opening of 
                                              the legal year in the same year. 
                                              It was the hope of those of us 
                                              from the sub-region who were 
                                              present at the time that an 
                                              association embracing all the Bar 
                                              Associations in the sub-region 
                                              will come about before long. 
                                              However, the political 
                                              developments and instability in 
                                              our various countries, not, to 
                                              talk of mutual distrust and 
                                              suspicion by our political 
                                              leaders, did not allow that 
                                              objective to be realised.</span></p>

                                              that Koforidua is hosting an 
                                              annual conference of the 
                                              association. Koforidua, an ancient 
                                              and historic town with a very warm 
                                              heart for visitors and which is 
                                              reputed to be full of &quot;flowers&quot;, 
                                              is grappling with the challenges 
                                              of modern development. It also 
                                              seeks to blend its culture and 
                                              tradition with modern 
                                              administration in its unique roles 
                                              as the capital of the New Juaben 
                                              Traditional Area and the capital 
                                              of the post-independent Eastern 
                                              Region of Ghana. That it faces new 
                                              challenges cannot be denied. So 
                                              also does our country Ghana, with 
                                              its chequered history. One of such 
                                              challenges is how to nurture and 
                                              sustain the survival of the Fourth 
                                              Republic and constitutional and 
                                              democratic rule in our country. 
                                              The theme for this conference. 
                                              &quot;Democracy and the Fourth 
                                              Republic: Review and Prospects&quot;, 
                                              is therefore appropriate as the 
                                              second year of the first 
                                              constitutional and civilian 
                                              administration of&nbsp; the Forth 
                                              Republic draws to a close and the 
                                              nation begins to review its 
                                              achievements and failures so far, 
                                              while it projects its future 
                                              prospects.&nbsp; To that theme, I now

                                              independence from Britain after 
                                              over a century of colonialism and 
                                              subjugation by various colonial 
                                              powers. It adopted for itself the

                                              set for itself. The First Republic 
                                              saw its independent Constitution, 
                                              which had provided for a 
                                              multi-party democracy, going 
                                              through a number of changes to a 
                                              one party state at the time that 
                                              the First Republic was forcefully 
                                              overthrown by the military junta 
                                              of the National Liberation Council 
                                              (NLC). 1969 saw the birth of the 
                                              Second Republic; and the Second 
                                              Republican Constitution reflected 
                                              the concerns and lessons learnt 
                                              from the failures, successes and 
                                              excesses of the First Republic. 
                                              But the Second Republic was not 
                                              destined to be the last Republic 
                                              as it was overthrown barely two 
                                              years later by the National 
                                              Redemption Council (NRC) in what 
                                              has become known as the &quot;Amenity 
                                              coup&quot; because its leaders thought, 
                                              just as the present drama in the 
                                              Gambia, that the Armed Forces had 
                                              been denied its just portion of 
                                              the national cake. The attempt by 
                                              the Supreme Military Council 
                                              (SMC), its successor, to foist an 
                                              untested political system of 
                                              governance which it dubbed &quot;Union 
                                              Government&quot; provoked strong 
                                              resistance of the nation. It was 
                                              soon overthrown by the Armed 
                                              Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), 
                                              made up of junior officers and 
                                              uncommissioned officers of the 
                                              Ghana Armed Forces. Their 
                                              imagination was fired by the claim 
                                              that there was deprivation and the 
                                              ordinary man could not make ends

                                              luxury and would leave [p.7] the 
                                              national stage without rendering

                                              The experiences of the NRC and SMC 
                                              military juntas, as well as our 
                                              previous ones, were reflected in 
                                              the Third Republican Constitution. 
                                              However, it lasted only a little 
                                              over two years. It was supplanted 
                                              by the Provisional National 
                                              Defence Council (PNDC) which in 
                                              decade and more launched a 
                                              &quot;revolution&quot; and set up new 
                                              political and legal bodies and 
                                              systems in the belief that the old 
                                              institutions were not responsive 
                                              enough to the aspirations of our 
                                              nation and our people. However, 
                                              the Fourth Republican Constitution 
                                              had had to find refuge in those 
                                              very bodies and systems as it drew 
                                              much inspiration from the 
                                              Constitutions, 1969 and 1979. Our 
                                              Constitution, 1992 decreed a 
                                              multi-party, civilian and 
                                              constitutional government and that 
                                              our nation shall be governed by 
                                              law. It brought into being the 
                                              Fourth Republic which was 
                                              inaugurated on 7 January 1993—now 
                                              one year, eight months and 
                                              nineteen days old. That is the

                                              very harrowing and nightmarish 
                                              experience for the legal 
                                              profession, originating with the 
                                              abduction and murder of the three 
                                              High Court judges. Judges, who 
                                              normally judge others before 
                                              pronouncing judgment, were 
                                              dismissed without a hearing. Never 
                                              mind that even God asked Adam: 
                                              &quot;Why have you eaten of the 
                                              forbidden fruit?&quot; The period also 
                                              saw the resignation and exodus of 
                                              some of the gems on the bench, 
                                              morale was low and people wondered 
                                              about its independence. Mention 
                                              must also be made of the setting 
                                              up of a totally separate 
                                              adjudicating system called the 
                                              &quot;Public Tribunals&quot; whose waters 
                                              never crossed that of His Lordship 
                                              the Chief Justice. But as events 
                                              then and even now demonstrate, 
                                              such as the trial and conviction 
                                              of its chairmen, claims by its 
                                              disgraced chairmen that they were 
                                              subjected to dictation by other 
                                              persons and bodies and a 
                                              scientific analysis of its total 
                                              output and performance compared 
                                              with its available logistics and 
                                              facilities, and the 40 per cent 
                                              salary inducement allowance 
                                              exclusively for its officials, 
                                              that was and could not be an 
                                              answer to the shortcomings and 
                                              failures of the system. The 
                                              judiciary, like any human 
                                              institution, has its weaknesses 
                                              and strengths, its failures and 
                                              successes. The judiciary has so 
                                              given a ray of hope that it 
                                              intends to jealously guard and 
                                              play its constitutional role. The 
                                              constitutional role and importance 
                                              of the judiciary in the survival 
                                              of the Fourth Republic cannot be 
                                              overemphasized. It is the 
                                              judiciary that is [p.8] expected 
                                              to be the independent arbiter in 
                                              the resolution of disputes between 
                                              individuals and also between the 
                                              individual and the State. It must 
                                              keep even the scales of justice. 
                                              The judiciary has, to my mind, 
                                              done creditably considering its 
                                              many constraints. It has stood 
                                              head and shoulders above some of 
                                              the institutions set up under the 
                                              Constitution.</span></p>

                                              But, Mr Chief Justice, there is so 
                                              much that the judiciary can do if 
                                              it is not to be found wanting.&nbsp; It 
                                              ranges from the trivial to matters 
                                              of substance. The judiciary needs 
                                              to become a modern institution in 
                                              terms of technology. It is a 
                                              crying shame that until a couple 
                                              of months ago, the judiciary did 
                                              not own one single computer but 
                                              had to rely on its World War II 
                                              manual typewriters. It has to 
                                              confront such issues as the delay 
                                              in the administration of justice, 
                                              improvement of its delivery 
                                              system, inefficient registries and 
                                              disinterested personnel; the 
                                              attitude, behaviour and 
                                              compartment of some judges and 
                                              magistrates; transparent honesty, 
                                              integrity and independence. The 
                                              judiciary needs to constantly 
                                              throw the searchlight on itself. I 
                                              submit that that is the only way 
                                              it can properly address its 
                                              shortcomings and the concerns of 
                                              everybody, create an image for 
                                              itself and put its integrity 
                                              beyond question and doubt. It is 
                                              only then that it can well and 
                                              truly play its crucial 
                                              constitutional role.</span></p>

                                              it will publish on monthly basis 
                                              the written judgments of the 
                                              Supreme Court and the Court of 
                                              Appeal. One does not therefore 
                                              have to wait indefinitely to know 
                                              what were the reasons of the 
                                              Supreme Court in any particular 
                                              constitutional case. We [p.9] have 
                                              been very fortunate to have the 
                                              active support of His Lordship the 
                                              Chief Justice who has given his 
                                              blessing to the project. We are

                                              The association has also initiated 
                                              action to have one of our courts 
                                              modernised and provided with the 
                                              latest technology to speed up the 
                                              trial of cases. It is envisaged 
                                              that this model court would be 
                                              computerised and would have a 
                                              sound recording system, amongst 
                                              others. His Lordship the Chief

                                              welcomed this development, has 
                                              designated Court 4, High Court, 
                                              Accra for this purpose. The USAID 
                                              is our benefactor for this project 
                                              also, although we are beginning to 
                                              realise that the project involves 
                                              more funds than we had originally 
                                              budgeted for. Our benefactors may

                                              The talk of good governance 
                                              naturally leads me to the 
                                              executive, the first arm of 
                                              government. It has been a very 
                                              slow, difficult, and sometimes 
                                              traumatic experience for the 
                                              executive, made up barely of 
                                              former PNDC appointees, to undergo 
                                              the metamorphosis from an absolute 
                                              military cum civilian dictatorship 
                                              to one of a constitutional and 
                                              multi-party democracy. In some 
                                              instances, it could be compared 
                                              with a difficult labour period 
                                              while at times it looks like a 
                                              reluctant child who has no other 
                                              choice but to comply with the firm 
                                              wishes of his no-nonsense and 
                                              vigilant mother. Nevertheless, 
                                              some progress has been made and 
                                              the difference between our 
                                              pre-Fourth Republican 
                                              constitutional era and now can be 
                                              likened to the difference between 
                                              chalk and cheese.</span></p>

                                              gentlemen, there have been times 
                                              when the very omissions of the 
                                              executive portray an attempt to 
                                              undermine the Constitution. It is 
                                              known for example that it is 
                                              almost three months since the 
                                              Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly 
                                              rejected the candidature of Nana 
                                              Akwasi Agyeman as its chief 
                                              executive. But, as at today, there 
                                              has been no further nomination and 
                                              the rejected candidate continues 
                                              in that office. In those 
                                              circumstances it is easy for 
                                              others to interpret it as an 
                                              attempt to subvert the 
                                              Constitution.</span></p>

                                              instances where adequate resources 
                                              have not been provided for 
                                              constitutional bodies like the 
                                              judiciary. One only has to compare 
                                              the financial appropriation made 
                                              to the judiciary as against that 
                                              of the National Commission on 
                                              Culture to appreciate the point. 
                                              In some instances there appears to 
                                              be a blissful ignorance of the 
                                              provisions of the Constitution. 
                                              This explains why motorists and 
                                              the travelling public are 
                                              routinely stopped by the police 
                                              both during the day and night, and 
                                              more particularly as you approach 
                                              or drive through Accra, and one's 
                                              vehicle and luggage are searched 
                                              by the police who do not even know 
                                              what they are looking for. It has 
                                              become part of the political and 
                                              security culture of the land and 
                                              the police are not yet aware of 
                                              article 21 (g) which decrees 
                                              &quot;freedom of movement which means 
                                              the right to move freely in 
                                              Ghana.&quot;</span></p>

                                              executive have been called into

                                              approach, development and 
                                              maintenance of the spirit of the

                                              that underlines any Constitution. 
                                              It embodies, amongst others, the

                                              people. It is that which unites a 
                                              nation and its people. It leads 
                                              eventually to the development of 
                                              conventions that aim at ensuring

                                              Constitution and becomes a

                                              of the Constitution as a living 
                                              organism. It is a concept that is 
                                              to be encouraged in any given 
                                              democracy.</span></p>

                                              The Constitution, 1992, based on 
                                              our experiences, has a spirit. In 
                                              my view, that spirit includes the 
                                              acknowledgment that we are all 
                                              Ghanaians, that we seek to build a 
                                              just and equitable society, that 
                                              we have chosen for ourselves a 
                                              constitutional democracy that 
                                              recognizes that each of us has a 
                                              part to play in its sustenance, 
                                              that power must be exercised in a 
                                              fair, unbiased manner and without 
                                              any discrimination whatsoever.</span></p>

                                              The spirit of the Constitution 
                                              comes into sharp focus when the 
                                              executive is to exercise some of 
                                              the powers granted to it by the 
                                              Constitution. Admittedly, the 
                                              executive has been granted 
                                              enormous power and authority. It 
                                              has no limitation, on some of the 
                                              appointments it can make. However, 
                                              let us pause and ask whether any 
                                              harm is done the executive if it 
                                              confers or [p.11] consults other 
                                              interested groups or parties 
                                              before making appointments to some 
                                              very sensitive national offices. 
                                              To my naive mind, no such harm is 
                                              done. On the contrary this 
                                              approach would lead to the 
                                              acceptance of such national 
                                              institutions as indeed national in 
                                              their Constitution and structure.</span></p>

                                              lot of disquiet has been expressed 
                                              in many quarters about the 
                                              appointment of members of the

                                              Education. To some, it is a

                                              executive. It may well be true or 
                                              false. But the effect of such 
                                              suspicion and mistrust is that it 
                                              undermines the authority and 
                                              integrity of that body and its 
                                              acceptability. It seems to me that

                                              Republic of Malawi, where I was 
                                              privileged to be a member of the 
                                              Joint International Observers 
                                              Group at its last election. When 
                                              President Kamuzu Banda accepted 
                                              the results of the referendum that 
                                              voted for multi-party democracy, 
                                              that country invited each of the 
                                              registered political parties to 
                                              nominate a person, not necessarily 
                                              a member of the party, to serve on 
                                              its Electoral Commission with the

                                              This approach has its dangers. But 
                                              its strength, as was demonstrated 
                                              by the results of the elections, 
                                              showed that each party had 
                                              expected to win the elections so 
                                              the rules and regulations were 
                                              made with no particular favourite 
                                              or condemned person in mind. The 
                                              rules of the game were mutually

                                              government to translate the 
                                              oneness of Ghana into reality in 
                                              its policies, programmes and 
                                              pronouncements. This will 
                                              naturally lead to drawing the line 
                                              between the government of the day 
                                              and the ruling party. In that way 
                                              ministers of State will not have 
                                              to don party garments at a public 
                                              function to commission a water 
                                              project for a community made up of 
                                              all and sundry. That way 
                                              celebration of national holidays 
                                              and events would become national 
                                              in character and reality.</span></p>

                                              Now, to the First Parliament of 
                                              the Fourth Republic. In a sense, 
                                              it is a [p.12] new beginning after 
                                              eleven years of non-parliamentary 
                                              culture and the absence of the 
                                              veterans leaving the field to the 
                                              new comers—the ninos. The absence 
                                              of a parliamentary opposition has 
                                              also not helped matters. Of 
                                              course, it has to be a tough 
                                              learning process. But with a term 
                                              of four years, it cannot continue 
                                              indefinitely to be the student. It 
                                              has to begin to show the much 
                                              desired result. It often times 
                                              looks as if the long years of no 
                                              Parliament has affected the 
                                              decorum, oratory, sharpness, 
                                              brilliance, productivity and 
                                              evergreen presence and integrity 
                                              of our present Parliament. The 
                                              different but complementary roles 
                                              of the executive and Parliament 
                                              seem to some as blurred. In their 
                                              view, Parliament is a mere rubber 
                                              stamp of the executive and 
                                              separation of powers cannot be 
                                              immediately seen.</span></p>

                                              It can be said without any 
                                              hesitation that on balance 
                                              Parliament is the weakest arm of 
                                              government which is yet to get its 
                                              act together. It is imperative 
                                              that both the executive and

                                              appearance in our national 
                                              politics in the Second Republican 
                                              Constitution, 1969. It was 
                                              designed to be an advisory body of 
                                              elders and to hold in cheek the 
                                              excesses of the President. This 
                                              still remains by and large its 
                                              role. In the Third Republic it 
                                              even had members in opposition to 
                                              the then government of the day in

                                              not the case today. The role that 
                                              the Council of State continues to 
                                              play has been called into question 
                                              and as to whether it is in fact 
                                              playing the independent, 
                                              non-partisan and senior citizen 
                                              role expected of it. Events such

                                              State welcoming back to the

                                              President, instead of the 
                                              Vice-President who was 
                                              conspicuously absent both at the 
                                              departure and arrival of the 
                                              President on his very recent

                                              raise the concerns of the ordinary 
                                              citizen. Further, do members of 
                                              the Council of State not 
                                              compromise their positions when 
                                              they regularly and continually are 
                                              seen as messengers of His

                                              delivering messages on his behalf 
                                              or appearing at the congress of 
                                              the ruling party without attending 
                                              those of the opposition? These are 
                                              not matters that can be easily 
                                              dismissed with a wave of the hand. 
                                              The council needs to address such 
                                              concerns and also let us know 
                                              whether their tenure is on 
                                              full-time or part-time basis and 
                                              whether they are beneficiaries of 
                                              any special benefits. This is the 
                                              only way to win and sustain the 
                                              respect of all Ghanaians. Let it

                                              gentlemen, the present National 
                                              Electoral Commission was born in 
                                              controversy. The appointment of 
                                              its members met with opposition 
                                              from a number of individuals, 
                                              bodies and political parties. It 
                                              was thought and felt that having 
                                              regard to the past performance of 
                                              some of its members, the 
                                              commission was incapable of being 
                                              independent. It is a credibility 
                                              crisis. It is agreed by all that 
                                              if the present experiment is to 
                                              succeed then there is the need for 
                                              fair, free, clean, transparent, 
                                              honest electoral body, process and 
                                              elections. This is the task that 
                                              faces the commission. It is 
                                              comforting to know that the 
                                              commission itself appreciates the 
                                              suspicion of the ordinary person 
                                              and the enormity of its task. Its 
                                              on-going consultations with all 
                                              political parties and donor 
                                              countries about electoral reform 
                                              is in the right direction, 
                                              commendable and needs the 
                                              encouragement of all. It is the 
                                              best safety valve. However, the 
                                              commission would have to firmly 
                                              and decisively grapple with such 
                                              important issues as a clean and 
                                              reliable voters' register, a 
                                              well-thought out voter 
                                              identification system, an 
                                              electoral process that ensures 
                                              fair and accurate election results 
                                              while eliminating impersonation, 
                                              intimidation, fraud and, rigging. 
                                              We would also like to warmly 
                                              congratulate all the political 
                                              parties for being able to work 
                                              together in this search and to 
                                              call upon them to extend their 
                                              co-operation to other spheres of 
                                              national endeavour. We reserve 
                                              special words of thanks and 
                                              appreciation to the donor 
                                              community and urge them on. We 
                                              [p.14] would like to believe that 
                                              electoral assistance to the 
                                              National Electoral Commission does 
                                              not mean that that commission is 
                                              not independent or that this 
                                              country has sold its sovereignty. 
                                              If this claim is true, then by 
                                              parity of reasoning, we have sold 
                                              our sovereignty to the World Bank 
                                              and the International Monetary 
                                              Fund.</span></p>

                                              Ultimately, however, it lies on 
                                              the commission itself to 
                                              appreciate its constitutional and 
                                              crucial role. It needs to give 
                                              flesh to its independence and 
                                              constitutional position. The 
                                              commission needs to be reminded 
                                              that each person or body charged 
                                              with social responsibility leaves 
                                              its marks on history. So did 
                                              Pontius Pilate. And the National 
                                              Electoral Commission would also 
                                              have to leave its mark. Let it not 
                                              be that it behaved like Pontius 
                                              Pilate.</span></p>

                                              all of us as the fourth estate of

                                              various courses. In the coming 
                                              years, they must demonstrate their 
                                              independence and understanding of 
                                              their respective roles. It is our

                                              Education does not seem to have 
                                              made any or much impact. The 
                                              commission ought to bear in mind 
                                              its constitutional importance and 
                                              expected independence at all

                                              very elaborate provisions on 
                                              directive principles of state 
                                              policy, economic rights, cultural 
                                              rights and practices, children's 
                                              rights, among others. The early 
                                              initiation of programmes by the 
                                              executive that will bring about 
                                              the full realisation of these 
                                              rights is imperative. As has 
                                              already been demonstrated, our 
                                              earlier attempts at constitutional 
                                              rule failed because of a number of 
                                              factors. It is therefore incumbent 
                                              on all institutions of State, 
                                              particularly the executive, and

                                              resurgence of these conditions.

                                              ordinary man is under siege. The

                                              sponsored and endorsed lotteries 
                                              and games of chance, the various
