                                              The common law action of breach of 
                                              promise to marry was part of the 
                                              received law of Ghana. It remains 
                                              a part of our received law, 
                                              although it has rarely been used.1 
                                              For many years, it had been 
                                              considered disreputable and has 
                                              since been abolished in England 
                                              and Wales.2 The agitation to 
                                              abolish that action has a long 
                                              history. Before the 1930s, the 
                                              agitation for the abolition of 
                                              this cause of action had begun in 
                                              England and the United States of 
                                              America. This led to a spate of 
                                              abolitions in many states of the 
                                              Union beginning from 1935.3 It 
                                              remained discredited and by the 
                                              time it was abolished in England, 
                                              it had such few friends that it 
                                              died a quiet and unremarked 
                                              death.4 In other common law 
                                              jurisdictions, efforts have been 
                                              made not to abolish it, but to 
                                              reduce its negative aspects by 
                                              giving it a statutory basis.5 
                                              Predictably, neither of these 
                                              efforts has had any influence on 
                                              the issue in Ghana.6 Therefore, 
                                              the action as it exists in Ghana, 
                                              is essentially a reflection of the 
                                              original common law position.</span></p>

                                              In the heated debates that 
                                              preceded the abolition in both the 
                                              United States and England, the 
                                              argument was put forward that the 
                                              action for breach of promise to 
                                              marry served no social purpose 
                                              other than to reward 
                                              &quot;gold-diggers.”7 It was said that 
                                              many women used the threat of that 
                                              action to procure money from men 
                                              who fell into their traps. If the 
                                              man did not want the embarrassment 
                                              of a law suit he would try to 
                                              avoid it by agreeing to a&nbsp; [p.42] 
                                              settlement. Hence, the images that 
                                              have been floated around are those 
                                              of the vicious and avaricious 
                                              young woman setting out to entrap 
                                              and extort money from a 
                                              well-meaning and respectable man 
                                              who had made a mistake of 
                                              judgment. The argument further 
                                              suggested that the virtuous woman 
                                              who had been truly wronged was too 
                                              decent to expose such intimate 
                                              aspects of her life to the glare 
                                              of publicity whilst the one who 
                                              did not want the match, anyway, 
                                              was enabled to cash in on the

                                              survives in Ghana, it has been put 
                                              to very little use. This may be 
                                              because the prospect of announcing 
                                              that one has been jilted, must

                                              could be a useful device in Ghana. 
                                              A recognition that these fact

                                              is concerned. On the contrary, it 
                                              would be an indication that women 
                                              are more confident about taking

                                              It would be as well to remember

                                              The cause of action known as 
                                              breach of promise to marry has 
                                              murky antecedents. It is unclear 
                                              whether it is a contract or a 
                                              tort. Some writers proceed upon 
                                              the premise that it sounds in 
                                              contract law.13 The Ghanaian 
                                              courts are of this category. 
                                              Others maintain that it is a 
                                              tort.14 For others still, it is a 
                                              hybrid because it straddles both 
                                              branches of the law.15 Certainly, 
                                              the various camps assign good 
                                              reasons for their positions. 
                                              However, it does appear that owing 
                                              to the fact that each side 
                                              emphasises the aspects most 
                                              reminiscent of either tort or 
                                              contract, the nature of the action 
                                              has become even more confused. It 
                                              would seem that the differences in 
                                              opinion are dictated by whether 
                                              one is looking at its constituent 
                                              elements, or its effect. As one 
                                              writer points out, there is no 
                                              real cause for disagreement 
                                              because &quot;[I]t is ex contractu in 
                                              form but ex delicto and penal in 
                                              nature and substance.&quot;16 Therefore 
                                              what it really is, is not of much 
                                              importance.</span></p>

                                              of fulfilment of the condition 
                                              before an action for the breach 
                                              would lie.19 Where there is a 
                                              general promise of marriage, an 
                                              intention to perform within a 
                                              reasonable time would be 
                                              imputed.20</span></p>

                                              An action for breach of promise to 
                                              marry arises when a person makes a 
                                              promise of marriage to another and 
                                              refuses to perform. The refusal 
                                              could be by conduct as evidenced 
                                              by marriage to another,21 or by an 
                                              express refusal upon a request for 
                                              performance.22 The refusal could 
                                              be communicated to the plaintiff 
                                              herself or himself, or to a third 
                                              party for the purpose of being 
                                              communicated to the plaintiff.23 
                                              When, unknown to the promisee, the 
                                              promisor is already married, or 
                                              marries another after the promise 
                                              has been made, the breach arises 
                                              by reason of the fact that the 
                                              promisor has no capacity to 
                                              contract another marriage because 
                                              of a subsisting one.24 An action 
                                              for anticipatory breach may also 
                                              be brought for the repudiation of 
                                              a conditional promise even before 
                                              the fulfilment of the condition 
                                              precedent.25 Where a breach is 
                                              established, damage is presumed.</span></p>

                                              As in a regular contract, the 
                                              promise could be held to be 
                                              unenforceable if there is evidence 
                                              that it was made in circumstances 
                                              that raise issues of public 
                                              policy. Therefore, where the 
                                              promisee knows that the promisor 
                                              is already married, the promise 
                                              would be unenforceable, even if 
                                              intended to take effect after the 
                                              death of the promisor's spouse.26 
                                              The law finds repugnant the idea 
                                              [p.45] that another would be 
                                              waiting in the wings, and, 
                                              presumably, hoping and praying for 
                                              the death of the promisor's 
                                              spouse. Questions of immorality 
                                              apart, who knows what crimes could 
                                              be spawned by the seeming 
                                              longevity of that spouse?</span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

                                              The promise is equally void if, 
                                              either party being married, the 
                                              promise is conditioned upon the 
                                              divorce of either party.27 Yet 
                                              again, it is clear that such an 
                                              agreement would encourage divorce 
                                              between a couple who probably 
                                              could, without the interference of 
                                              third parties, work out their 
                                              marital problems.28 Although this 
                                              rule enables the defendant from 
                                              taking advantage of his or her own 
                                              wrong, ie protects the promisor 
                                              from being sued, it disables the 
                                              plaintiff from benefiting 
                                              likewise.29 This result can be 
                                              justified on the ground that a 
                                              contrary position would be 
                                              tantamount to enlisting the aid of 
                                              the courts in prosecuting an 
                                              immoral claim. Therefore a person 
                                              who enters into such an agreement 
                                              bears the risk of the other party 
                                              reneging on it after the divorce 
                                              has been obtained at that party's 
                                              urging. Thus such a promisee would 
                                              be denied a claim if the promisor 
                                              exploits the situation to obtain 
                                              his or her freedom and thereafter, 
                                              marries another. However, where 
                                              the promise is renewed after the 
                                              divorce, it would support the 
                                              action.30 At least that would 
                                              support the theory that a party 
                                              without marital ties may properly 
                                              make such commitments.</span></p>

                                              Owning to the nature of the 
                                              action, there are very few 
                                              defences once there is evidence 
                                              that a promise of marriage was 
                                              made. Whilst it is a defence to 
                                              show that the marriage would have 
                                              been against the law,31 it is no 
                                              defence to show that the marriage 
                                              would have been unhappy if the 
                                              marriage had taken [p.46] place 
                                              because the promisor had fallen 
                                              out of love with the promisee.32 
                                              Indeed, even where there is 
                                              evidence that the plaintiff had no 
                                              affection for the defendant, it 
                                              would only go in mitigation of 
                                              damages.33 The disapproval of the 
                                              promisee by the promisor's family 
                                              is no defence,34 nor is the 
                                              disapproval of the promisee's 
                                              family by the promisor.35 In other 
                                              words, not liking a party's family 
                                              is no reason to renege on the

                                              Other factors that operate as 
                                              defences include the plaintiff's 
                                              unchastity, illness of the 
                                              defendant and an agreement to

                                              payment of compensation, ie an 
                                              agreement to pay off the promise. 
                                              The unchastity of a plaintiff is a 
                                              defence36 because the nature of 
                                              the relationship under 
                                              contemplation is such that the 
                                              defendant is entitled to expect 
                                              chastity from the plaintiff. 
                                              However, it operates as a defence 
                                              only if the fact is concealed

                                              often played a role in the measure

                                              The defendant’s conduct during the 
                                              trial of the suit may also be the 
                                              subject of the award of aggravated 
                                              damages. Unfounded allegations of 
                                              unchastity is treated as “adding

                                              the unchastity of the plaintiff is 
                                              a defence if unknown before the 
                                              promise was made,58 the defendant

                                              the allegation is not proved, or 
                                              if found to be wholly untrue, the 
                                              damages awardable would be 
                                              aggravated. The reason for this is 
                                              that the defendant would have 
                                              shown himself to be, not only 
                                              dishonourable in trying to wriggle 
                                              out of an obligation, but also 
                                              dishonest in attempting to justify 
                                              his behaviour by attacking the

                                              are not awarded often unless the

                                              fraud and malice. In Drobnich v

                                              the whole engagement was 
                                              fraudulent. This was also the case

                                              plaintiff was accessible to him 
                                              and that he could marry her if he 
                                              chose to. So malicious was this 
                                              motive that the court thought it 
                                              was an appropriate case for the 
                                              award of punitive damages.</span></p>

                                              In awarding punitive damages for 
                                              the manner of breach, the 
                                              rationale is that certain modes of 
                                              behaviour in communicating the 
                                              breach are unacceptable. Going out 
                                              of one's way to cause pain when 
                                              one is also in breach of an 
                                              agreement is evidence of malice. 
                                              This is because a decision not to 
                                              go ahead with a planned marriage, 
                                              if made in good faith, would be 
                                              made with the knowledge that it 
                                              would cause pain. Therefore, 
                                              evidence of &quot;wantonness and 
                                              ruthlessness and an intention to 
                                              unnecessarily injure feelings,&quot;63 
                                              makes a good case for the award of 
                                              punitive damages.</span></p>

                                              Damages may however be mitigated 
                                              by the operation of certain 
                                              factors. The rationale for this is 
                                              that although breaching such an 
                                              agreement is indefensible in all 
                                              but the most serious situations, 
                                              there are certain factors that 
                                              render the conduct of the 
                                              defendant less reprehensible than 
                                              it would otherwise be. The fact is 
                                              therefore acknowledged by 
                                              mitigating the damages. For 
                                              instance, a plaintiff is entitled 
                                              to claim damages for loss of 
                                              reputation. However, where the 
                                              plaintiff had little by way of 
                                              reputation, this fact has to be 
                                              reflected in the measure of 
                                              damages.64</span></p>

                                              Again, owing to the fact that this 
                                              action is based on a failure to 
                                              marry, the plaintiff's lack of 
                                              feeling for the defendant is a 
                                              material fact that goes to 
                                              mitigate the damages. Mount v 
                                              Boget65 is illustrative of the 
                                              point under discussion. The 
                                              defendant alleged that the 
                                              plaintiff did not care for him. He 
                                              alleged this because the plaintiff 
                                              had told him that he looked like 
                                              &quot;a Maypole with an apple stuck on 
                                              top and like a liberty Pole with 
                                              an umbrella on it&quot;; [p.50] that he 
                                              was soft in the head; a fool; &quot;a 
                                              double-tongued Dutchman&quot; whose 
                                              company she was ashamed of; that 
                                              he was &quot;good for nothing except 
                                              making money&quot;; that she &quot;would not 
                                              have him if he was worth the whole 
                                              of New York or if every hair on 
                                              his head was hung with diamonds.&quot; 
                                              In consequence, the trial court 
                                              instructed the jury that if she 
                                              truly held these opinions, then 
                                              she had escaped a curse and not 
                                              lost a benefit.66</span></p>

                                              The rationale for permitting such 
                                              a cause of action at common law 
                                              lay in the conception of marriage 
                                              in the Anglo-Saxon society. 
                                              Marriage was a sacred duty and 
                                              therefore a failure to honour a 
                                              promise of marriage was a serious 
                                              matter. In those days, marriage 
                                              was a spiritual matter and under 
                                              the jurisdiction of the 
                                              ecclesiastical courts. The 
                                              ecclesiastical court would 
                                              therefore compel a man who had 
                                              made such a promise, to go through 
                                              with it.</span></p>

                                              passed to the common law courts 
                                              which could award only damages as

                                              The loss lay in the fact that 
                                              marriage represented economic 
                                              security for a woman. It carried 
                                              social status since it was 
                                              considered the most honourable 
                                              estate for a woman in a 
                                              patriarchal society. Virginity was 
                                              also a prized possession because: 
                                              &quot;[A] woman who was no longer 
                                              chaste had lost something both of 
                                              psychic value and of value on the 
                                              marriage market. She was 'damaged 
                                              goods.'&quot;74 To be deprived of these 
                                              valuables by a faithless lover was 
                                              therefore a quantifiable loss for 
                                              which the award of damages would 
                                              be appropriate.</span></p>

                                              Another justification for the 
                                              action was that it enabled a woman 
                                              who had been seduced, and who had 
                                              borne an illegitimate child, to 
                                              bring claims against the father of 
                                              the child. Since at common law an 
                                              illegitimate child was not 
                                              entitled to the support of the 
                                              father, it became a convenient 
                                              means by which the rules could be 
                                              circumvented. The damages thus 
                                              obtained became a means by which 
                                              the mother could maintain herself 
                                              and her child at a time when the 
                                              labour market was virtually closed 
                                              to women.75</span></p>

                                              Furthermore, where the change of 
                                              mind had occurred so late that 
                                              expenses had been incurred towards 
                                              the preparation for the wedding, 
                                              someone had to bear the loss. 
                                              Sometimes substantial outlay of 
                                              expenditure would have occurred 
                                              because the plaintiff would have 
                                              purchased a trousseau and other 
                                              things which would be of use only 
                                              if the marriage had taken place. 
                                              These situations raised legal 
                                              issues as to the proper party to 
                                              bear the loss. It was not fair to 
                                              let it lie where it fell since it 
                                              would lie too&nbsp; heavily on the 
                                              party who had done nothing to 
                                              create the situation. For all the 
                                              above reasons, therefore, it made 
                                              sense to consider the breach an 
                                              actionable wrong.</span></p>

                                              Much of the criticism that has 
                                              preceded abolition efforts have 
                                              centred on the negative aspects of 
                                              the action. It has been blamed for 
                                              creating a market in extortion. It 
                                              has also been derided because the 
                                              fact of appearing to soothe 
                                              wounded feelings with money has 
                                              been thought to be ridiculous.&quot;76 
                                              Yet again, [p.52] the image of the 
                                              economically-dependent woman is 
                                              considered an affront to the gains 
                                              that the feminist movement has 
                                              made in this century.</span></p>

                                              All these criticisms have some 
                                              merit, but they are not unique to 
                                              this cause of action. One of the 
                                              biggest problems in insurance is 
                                              fraudulent claims. Yet no one 
                                              suggests that insurance should be 
                                              abolished because of it. As to 
                                              soothing wounded feelings and 
                                              compensating loss of reputation 
                                              with money, actions for defamation 
                                              do no less. For those worried 
                                              about the image of women, this 
                                              action does nothing that alimony 
                                              suits do not do. The economically 
                                              independent woman who does not 
                                              depend upon marriage for social 
                                              status is still very much in the 
                                              minority. In any case, depriving a 
                                              person who has been treated this 
                                              way of a cause of action leaves a 
                                              big gap in the law. Why should 
                                              people whose deepest feelings have 
                                              been trifled with, have no 
                                              recourse when a bruised toe would 
                                              be actionable under the same 
                                              system of law?</span></p>

                                              Critics of this cause of action 
                                              also claim that the action works 
                                              unfairness to defendants since it 
                                              proceeds upon the assumption that 
                                              the marriage would have been an 
                                              advantage to the plaintiff. Since 
                                              the defendant could have been a 
                                              bad husband or wife, or the 
                                              marriage could have been unhappy, 
                                              the argument goes, the plaintiff 
                                              may have been saved from much 
                                              unhappiness. This may be true but 
                                              the same presumption underlies all 
                                              other contracts. The law has never 
                                              operated upon the assumption that 
                                              the breach of an obligation may 
                                              have, in fact, been in the 
                                              plaintiff's interest. At all 
                                              times, the relevant question is 
                                              whether one party to an agreement 
                                              voluntarily entered into, is 
                                              refusing to perform. Furthermore, 
                                              the criticism is promised upon 
                                              such speculation that the law 
                                              would be better off not embarking 
                                              upon such an inquiry. Who is to 
                                              know whether a seemingly 
                                              irresponsible man would not mature 
                                              into a model husband and vice

                                              marriages that would have been 
                                              unhappy are averted. Whilst this 
                                              holds some truth, the possibility 
                                              of a suit would also be a check on 
                                              those who are apt to take 
                                              advantage of the relationship 
                                              during that period. It is the 
                                              defendants who have abused the 
                                              engagement by initiating sexual 
                                              activity and enjoying other 
                                              benefits attached to marriage, and 
                                              not the plaintiffs who have sought 
                                              redress for such abuse, that 
                                              deserve criticism.</span></p>

                                              An assessment of the cases from 
                                              some of the Commonwealth 
                                              jurisdictions indicate that this 
                                              action served a real purpose even 
                                              if liable to abuse. It is true 
                                              that those cases of extortion that 
                                              created social anxiety and led to 
                                              efforts to abolish the action did 
                                              not end up in the law reports. 
                                              However, those that did were 
                                              worthy of intervention by the law 
                                              even if the motives for bringing 
                                              the suit were not honourable ones. 
                                              There is no evidence that even in 
                                              business, motives for taking legal 
                                              action are always honourable ones 
                                              and strictly for business reasons 
                                              only. Since when has the law 
                                              concerned itself with the [p.53] 
                                              plaintiff's motivation rather than 
                                              the existence of an actionable 
                                              wrong?</span></p>

                                              For the feminists whose sense of 
                                              propriety is violated by this 
                                              cause of action, there is good 
                                              reason why its continued existence 
                                              should not be frowned upon. There 
                                              is nothing wrong with the law 
                                              playing referee, even among 
                                              equals. Despite the battle for the 
                                              equality of the sexes, the fact 
                                              remains that in matters of sexual 
                                              morality, women are judged more 
                                              harshly than men. Therefore a 
                                              woman who constantly changes 
                                              partners does not command as much 
                                              respect, or marriage value in 
                                              society, as one who changes less 
                                              frequently. Certainly this is true 
                                              of most African societies. Again, 
                                              marriage is still prized among 
                                              African women although it may not 
                                              represent the economic security 
                                              that it once did. Persons who 
                                              remain single beyond a certain age 
                                              implicitly lose their seniority in 
                                              the extended family to younger 
                                              ones who are married; and 
                                              therefore to be denied the 
                                              opportunity is to have been denied 
                                              something of extrinsic worth. It 
                                              is also true that generally a 
                                              woman's virginity does not command 
                                              the premium that it once did on 
                                              the marriage-market, and therefore 
                                              there is little question as to 
                                              &quot;damaged goods&quot;, but this is not 
                                              altogether true of muslim 
                                              societies. Although motherhood 
                                              outside marriage is not frowned 
                                              upon as severely as it used to be 
                                              in European societies, it is not 
                                              the ideal state of respectability 
                                              either. It is also an undeniable 
                                              fact that it decreases one's 
                                              chances of ever getting married. 
                                              Can it seriously be argued that a 
                                              woman who suffers this because of 
                                              a broken promise of marriage has 
                                              suffered no wrong for which the 
                                              law should provide a remedy?</span></p>

                                              Whilst the payment of damages 
                                              would not restore lost reputation, 
                                              it would be more of a check on 
                                              those who lead other people on and 
                                              then abandon them at will, or 
                                              desert them when the material 
                                              benefits have been exhausted. It 
                                              is an undeniable fact that keeping 
                                              a woman engaged for a long time 
                                              and jilting her deprives her of 
                                              other prospects of marriage that 
                                              she would have had. Furthermore, 
                                              there can be little argument about 
                                              the emotional injury that is 
                                              suffered and the scars that are 
                                              left behind by the fact of having 
                                              been jilted. There must be a legal 
                                              recourse for such behaviour. It is 
                                              the existence of a cause of action 
                                              that signals the law's disapproval 
                                              of such behaviour as unacceptable.

                                              intervention. The parties met at a 
                                              time when both of them were 
                                              married to other people. They 
                                              agreed to divorce their spouses in 
                                              order to get married. A date was 
                                              set for the wedding and the woman 
                                              incurred a lot of expenditure in 
                                              preparation for the event. During 
                                              the wedding ceremony, the groom 
                                              refused to sign the marriage

                                              in love with someone else. The 
                                              priest tried to reconcile them but 
                                              failed. Consequently, he was 
                                              obliged to announce to the wedding 
                                              guests that the wedding had been 
                                              [p.55] cancelled. The plaintiff 
                                              subsequently brought this action, 
                                              claiming damages for embarrassment 
                                              as well as for nervous shock. She 
                                              also claimed special damages for 
                                              the expenses incurred in the 
                                              preparation for the wedding, and 
                                              for psychiatric care. Would a

                                              defendant, brought action for a

                                              counsel argued that at customary

                                              Afrifa v Class-Peter.89 This was 
                                              an [p.56] appeal against the award 
                                              of damages for breach of promise 
                                              to marry the respondent. The 
                                              evidence as to whether there had 
                                              been a valid customary marriage

                                              merely engaged under customary law 
                                              and therefore the action was the 
                                              appropriate one. This was affirmed

                                              anxious to find that the promise

                                              customary marriage and the 
                                              Ordinance marriage were different. 
                                              There was no discussion of the 
                                              appropriateness of the action 
                                              since the court took it for

                                              promise to marry was the central

                                              judge went on to say that they 
                                              were also engaged to be married 
                                              under the Ordinance. This was as a 
                                              result of the presentation of a 
                                              Bible and ring. That meant that 
                                              there was a further promise by the 
                                              man that the marriage would be

                                              make, because in the culture from

                                              particular circumstances in which 
                                              the cause of action was upheld. 
                                              The parties were married under 
                                              customary law. This raised serious 
                                              issues of a general societal 
                                              nature, yet the case was treated 
                                              as if the only issue at stake was 
                                              whether there was sufficient 
                                              evidence of the promise.93 
                                              However, the real issue at stake 
                                              was whether a promise to convert a

                                              into a monogamous one was 
                                              enforceable at law. It is true 
                                              that in the particular social 
                                              context, marriage under the 
                                              Ordinance commands greater respect 
                                              among certain sections of the 
                                              Ghanaian society, but does that 
                                              create a legal obligation to 
                                              honour a promise so made or pay 
                                              damages?94 What is the implication

                                              as this one? Not the least 
                                              troubling, is the fact that at the 
                                              time Aning v Kingful was decided, 
                                              it had become possible to petition 
                                              the High Court for the dissolution 
                                              of a customary marriage.95 This 
                                              being so, a further question that 
                                              needs to be posed is this: Does a 
                                              fact situation that would be 
                                              adequate grounds for divorce, also 
                                              support a breach of promise of 
                                              marriage? Does divorce not make a 
                                              presumption of marriage, whilst 
                                              the action for breach of promise 
                                              makes a presumption of not having 
                                              been married? Can [p.58] one be 
                                              both married and unmarried at the 
                                              same time?96 It is conceded that 
                                              there are situations in which one 
                                              could operate in more than one 
                                              capacity. However, marriage 
                                              relates to status and therefore, 
                                              one either is, or is not.</span></p>

                                              cannot grant damages for divorce, 
                                              then the issue is this: should a

                                              maintaining a marriage under 
                                              customary law be entitled to 
                                              damages when they would not be 
                                              available to others seeking 
                                              divorce from the courts? The same 
                                              consideration goes for injured 
                                              feelings. If the injured feelings 
                                              of the plaintiff are a basis for 
                                              the award of damages, why are 
                                              deserted wives not entitled to 
                                              damages for their injured

                                              under the Ordinance of more 
                                              economic value than a customary

                                              economic benefit is at the very 
                                              foundation of the action)?

                                              198599 this was so as there were

                                              intestacy.100 However, since the 
                                              rights were contingent upon 
                                              intestacy, those economic rights 
                                              did not automatically accrue to 
                                              one married under the Ordinance.

                                              ludicrous—especially since there 
                                              would be no evidence of the

                                              certificate evidencing her 
                                              marriage under customary law, 
                                              could by that means also obtain 
                                              damages on the ground of not 
                                              having been married. What if the 
                                              action were brought by a 
                                              plaintiff, married under the 
                                              Ordinance but not under customary 
                                              law? Would the action be 
                                              countenanced? If not, is this not 
                                              because of the perception that 
                                              marriage under the Ordinance is 
                                              inherently superior to customary 
                                              marriage? What about a plaintiff 
                                              married according to Islamic rites 
                                              and registered under the Marriage 
                                              of Mohammedans Ordinance105 but 
                                              who claimed the right to be 
                                              married in a civil ceremony under 
                                              the Marriage Ordinance because of 
                                              a desire for a monogamous 
                                              marriage? Would that have been 
                                              treated differently? These are 
                                              questions that require some 
                                              reflection because they involve 
                                              serious issues of public policy.</span></p>

                                              There is the further issue of the

                                              a Christian marriage,106 there is 
                                              no such logical progression to 
                                              holding that it refers to marriage 
                                              under the Ordinance. A marriage 
                                              under the Ordinance can be 
                                              contracted in a civil or religious 
                                              ceremony. It therefore does not 
                                              automatically follow that a 
                                              promise to marry in church is 
                                              anything more than a church 
                                              blessing. If this sounds like 
                                              academic hair-splitting, so does 
                                              the legal meaning of the 
                                              presentation of the Bible and ring

                                              monogamous one, would the action

                                              costs? Would he not have been

                                              is no reason why in an appropriate 
                                              case, it could not be used for a 
                                              failure to contract a customary 
                                              marriage. There is less of a 
                                              danger of fabricated evidence than 
                                              under the English system where an 
                                              agreement to marry often takes 
                                              place between the couple only. At 
                                              least here, the court would not be 
                                              left in the position of having to 
                                              choose between the word of the 
                                              plaintiff and that of the 
                                              defendant.</span></p>

                                              to intervene in situations that 
                                              are peculiarly Ghanaian. In 
                                              Djarbeng v Tagoe108 the High Court 
                                              per Ampiah J (as he then was) held 
                                              that a valid promise of marriage 
                                              could not be proved because what 
                                              was put in evidence did not [p.62] 
                                              measure up to the requirements of 
                                              customary law. The facts were that 
                                              the defendant had an amorous 
                                              relationship with the plaintiff 
                                              resulting in the birth of a child. 
                                              The defendant then left the 
                                              country for the United Kingdom and 
                                              wrote letters to the plaintiff 
                                              informing her that he had made up 
                                              his mind to marry her. There was 
                                              also an allegation (described in 
                                              the report as &quot;mere&quot;) that at an 
                                              earlier paternity ceremony, the 
                                              defendant's family had agreed on 
                                              his behalf that he would marry the 
                                              plaintiff. On these facts, the 
                                              learned judge held that there was 
                                              no evidence of a promise to marry 
                                              either under the Marriage 
                                              Ordinance or customary law.</span></p>

                                              This is a conclusion that is hard 
                                              to support even on his lordship's 
                                              own reading of the case. Even if 
                                              no weight was attached to the 
                                              promise made on behalf of the 
                                              defendant (and rightly so), a like 
                                              attitude to the defendant's own 
                                              letters cannot be justified. The 
                                              judge placed much weight on the 
                                              traditional modes of contracting 
                                              marriage, stating that when a man 
                                              desired to marry a woman, he 
                                              applied to the family of the woman 
                                              through his own family for their 
                                              consent. Therefore any other mode 
                                              could not be proper. For this 
                                              reason his lordship held that what 
                                              had transpired did not amount to a 
                                              promise because the family of the 
                                              man was not involved. This seems a 
                                              strange conclusion to draw, 
                                              judging by the fact that there was 
                                              an allegation of a “promise&quot; 
                                              having been made by the 
                                              defendant's family on his behalf. 
                                              If it was a family involvement his 
                                              lordship was looking for, there 
                                              was ample evidence of it. In a 
                                              system of law which permits 
                                              marriage ceremonies to be 
                                              performed in the absence of the 
                                              parties to the union, it seems 
                                              strange that so much emphasis 
                                              should have been put on the fact 
                                              of the defendant's absence. His 
                                              family could have given those 
                                              assurances if he had instructed 
                                              them to do so. Therefore his 
                                              absence per se was not of dramatic 
                                              importance.</span></p>

                                              Secondly, if a valid promise of 
                                              marriage could be made only 
                                              through the man’s family,109 then 
                                              what was wrong with the promise 
                                              made at the paternity ceremony? If 
                                              it is true that custom does not 
                                              permit a man to make valid 
                                              promises of marriage on his own 
                                              account, then there is no basis 
                                              for rejecting the family’s 
                                              assurance at the paternity 
                                              ceremony. If, on the other hand, 
                                              promises made by the family are 
                                              not binding on the man, then his 
                                              own assurances must be binding. To 
                                              deny that a man may give his own 
                                              assurances, and also that such 
                                              assurances may be given on his 
                                              behalf, is [p.63] tantamount to 
                                              saying that a man can never make a 
                                              valid promise of marriage. One 
                                              cannot have it both ways. 
                                              Therefore, one of those two 
                                              versions of the customary law must 
                                              be wrong.</span></p>

                                              This was indeed, a proper case for 
                                              the action of breach of promise to 
                                              marry. The law should not allow

                                              intention of fulfilling them to 
                                              get away with their misdeeds. In

                                              a reliance of the plaintiff on 
                                              such assurances deserves legal

                                              position could only breed chaos. 
                                              Whilst it is conceded that the 
                                              mere fact of the birth of a child 
                                              does not amount to a promise, the 
                                              law should not idly sit by, if 
                                              subsequent promises of marriage go 
                                              unhonoured.</span></p>

                                              days, in the company of members of

                                              have been exploited by another by 
                                              the promise of marriage. For 
                                              instance, there are situations in 
                                              which a man makes a promise to 
                                              marry a woman but is unable to 
                                              afford the expenses involved in

                                              intention of fulfilling? If at the 
                                              time he made the promise, he had 
                                              every intention of honouring it, 
                                              should he be able to change his

                                              a match. It would also have

                                              One more circumstance in which 
                                              this action should be available 
                                              pertains to married men who 
                                              contract other marriages. It is 
                                              common knowledge that these 
                                              bigamous associations exist at 
                                              such a level as to have become 
                                              almost respectable in the society. 
                                              Many men contract monogamous 
                                              marriages and then, either through 
                                              ignorance or deliberate act, 
                                              purport to contract other 
                                              customary marriages. Where the 
                                              man's status is concealed from the 
                                              woman, it ought to be possible for 
                                              her to maintain an action. It is

                                              that in Ghana, very few women go 
                                              through such marriages without 
                                              some knowledge of the man's 
                                              status. However, this occurs 
                                              mostly because of ignorance of 
                                              what a previous marriage under the 
                                              Ordinance means to the legality of 
                                              any subsequent marriage. Since it 
                                              is the party who gives the 
                                              warranty who is in breach, this

                                              the &quot;victim&quot; could be presumed, by 
                                              reason of special circumstances, 
                                              to have knowledge of such lack of 
                                              capacity.112 Where a caveat is 
                                              entered by another to stop the 
                                              proposed marriage, it would be 
                                              unjust if the law offered no legal 
                                              [p.65] remedy. For in this case, 
                                              not only would expenses have been 
                                              incurred, but the social 
                                              humiliation would also be 
                                              substantial.</span></p>

                                              There are two distinct situations 
                                              here: that of one married under 
                                              the Ordinance and therefore 
                                              without capacity to contract a 
                                              fresh marriage, and that of one 
                                              married under customary law. In 
                                              the latter situation, the problem 
                                              arises if the fact of a previous 
                                              subsisting marriage is 
                                              fraudulently concealed from the 
                                              promisee. These raise identical 
                                              issues, but they would be 
                                              discussed severally since the 
                                              former marriage is bigamous113 
                                              whilst the latter is lawful.</span></p>

                                              Where the person is monogamously 
                                              married, the point would be that 
                                              the relationship contracted with 
                                              the plaintiff is void. For this 
                                              reason an action would lie. 
                                              Therefore a person who leads 
                                              another into such an ineffectual 
                                              marriage fails to &quot;marry&quot; and 
                                              should be liable if the other 
                                              party seeks a remedy at law.114 
                                              Although this action, like the 
                                              provisions on bigamy, have never 
                                              stopped anyone intent on 
                                              contracting such a marriage, it is 
                                              important to recognize the 
                                              existence of a remedy for those 
                                              willing to make use of it.</span></p>

                                              Where the other party is married 
                                              under customary law, there are two 
                                              possibilities. A female defendant 
                                              would be liable because she does 
                                              not have the capacity under 
                                              customary law to contract more 
                                              than one marriage at a time. 
                                              However, with a male defendant it 
                                              would be enough to show that the 
                                              plaintiff knew of the marital 
                                              status and agreed to contract the 
                                              marriage. Since the man retains 
                                              capacity to contract further 
                                              marriages, no injury would have 
                                              been done where the woman knew of 
                                              his marital status. Promises of 
                                              the man to divorce his wife should 
                                              also be treated as at common law 
                                              and held to be contrary to public 
                                              policy.115</span></p>

                                              Evidence of concealment would 
                                              raise different issues from those 
                                              discussed above. The otherwise 
                                              lawful nature of the marriage 
                                              notwithstanding, the fraud 
                                              perpetuated on the promisee at the 
                                              time of the promise by reason of 
                                              the defendant having a subsisting 
                                              customary marriage with another 
                                              should found the cause of action. 
                                              This situation must be 
                                              distinguished from the situation 
                                              in the Aning v Kingful case. At 
                                              least in that situation, there is 
                                              no social opprobrium, as when a 
                                              woman undeservedly earns the name 
                                              of &quot;husband-snatcher&quot; by marrying 
                                              a married man. There is certainly 
                                              a measure of loss of reputation 
                                              involved which would be deserving 
                                              of an award of damages. Therefore 
                                              where a decree of nullity would be 
                                              available to one who purported to 
                                              marry under the Ordinance, this 
                                              action should be available to one

                                              believe that it is appropriate to

                                              not available to the one whose 
                                              life forms the subject of an 
                                              action for seduction because the 
                                              right of action is in another.119 
                                              The existence of this action is 
                                              also a much-needed affirmation 
                                              that at some point in time, a 
                                              woman is capable of maintaining a 
                                              challenge to those who would 
                                              exploit her and then treat her 
                                              with contempt. There is yet again 
                                              the possibility that the potential 
                                              plaintiff would be an independent 
                                              woman whose father could with 
                                              little credibility claim damages 
                                              for loss of services, etc.120 
                                              Besides, this action is not 
                                              limited to any age and so any 
                                              person with a grievance may 
                                              maintain an action and not be 
                                              denied redress for a wrong that is 
                                              undeniable. In modern Ghana, the 
                                              action has psychological value for 
                                              women and should be appropriately 
                                              exploited. </span></p>

                                              The proposals made above are not 
                                              as revolutionary as they are apt 
                                              to be perceived at first blush. A 
                                              casual look around would reveal 
                                              how many men and women could have 
                                              resorted to this action if its 
                                              portents had been better 
                                              appreciated. The fact that very 
                                              few people litigate issues 
                                              relating to matters involving 
                                              intimate details does not mean 
                                              that such actions are considered 
                                              foreign, or that they would 
                                              continue to be regarded as such. 
                                              There are many factors, not the 
                                              least of them being the 
                                              availability of counsel who 
                                              appreciates the merits of the 
                                              cause of action, why very little 
                                              use has been made of it. In 
                                              addition, the propaganda that has 
                                              accompanied the abolition of that 
                                              cause of action has served to

                                              In this paper, an attempt has been 
                                              made to establish the cause of 
                                              action as a legitimate one for 
                                              wider application. This has been 
                                              done through an exposition of its 
                                              nature and incidents. This was 
                                              followed by an analysis of the 
                                              criticisms that have led to its 
                                              abolition in some common law 
                                              jurisdictions. Lastly, the common 
                                              fact-situations in which this 
                                              action would serve the ends of

                                              hope is that more of such 
                                              &quot;victims&quot; would be encouraged to 
                                              seek legal remedies instead of 
                                              putting up with their loss, or 
                                              remaining in marriages procured by 
                                              fraud, only because of the 
                                              possibility of losing out 
                                              completely.</span></p>

                                              The difficulties inherent in 
                                              upholding the action when the 
                                              parties are already married under 
                                              customary law have been noted. It 
                                              is suggested that unless the 
                                              situation involves a concealment 
                                              of a subsisting previous marriage, 
                                              the action should not be upheld.

                                              a promise to marry monogamously 
                                              when he had already contracted 
                                              away his capacity for doing so 
                                              should be treated as a distinct 
                                              situation from when no such 
                                              disability exists. In the one 
                                              case, it involves fraud, but this 
                                              is not necessarily so where it 
                                              involves a subsequent change of 
                                              mind. Where it involves the latter 
                                              situation, the remedy should be 
                                              divorce so as to avoid the down 
                                              grading of the customary form of 
                                              marriage in order to uphold this 
                                              cause of action.</span></p>

                                              considerable thought in order to 
                                              solve two problems: forestalling 
                                              the situations of blackmail which 
                                              have discredited this action, and 
                                              discouraging unscrupulous persons 
                                              from taking advantage of others. 
                                              The mere fact that it enables men 
                                              to be blackmailed is not a good 
                                              enough reason to neglect the 
                                              action, since the contrary 
                                              situation enables women's 
                                              affections to be abused with 
                                              impunity. If the possibility of 
                                              blackmail is known, that should 
                                              encourage more openness and 
                                              honesty in intimate relationships. 
                                              On the whole, it is better for 
                                              society to hold people to promises 
                                              made—even of marriage—and to

                                              application of the action, for, 
                                              which rule of law is not capable 
                                              of abuse? On a more important 
                                              level, however, it should reduce 
                                              the powerlessness of women in 
                                              intimate relationships. People 
                                              should be encouraged not to let 
                                              losses lie where they have 
                                              fallen—especially in deserving 
                                              cases. The law may not be helpful 
                                              in preventing breaches of faith, 
                                              but there is no doubt that raising 
                                              the cost of a breach may assist in 
                                              that regard. </span></p>

                                              according to Ga customary law then

                                              there were two accounts; that the

                                              months of November 1970, then the

                                              February 1971 and therefore by the 
                                              time the action was brought, it 
                                              was statute-barred: see paragraph

                                              Ordinance marriage carries

                                              receptions (as in England) and it 
                                              is desired by the female spouses 
                                              for the enhanced position that it

                                              were mere concubines and not

                                              seduction is the loss of the 
                                              girl's services by reason of the 
                                              seduction. Therefore the claim of 
                                              the father of a woman who lives
