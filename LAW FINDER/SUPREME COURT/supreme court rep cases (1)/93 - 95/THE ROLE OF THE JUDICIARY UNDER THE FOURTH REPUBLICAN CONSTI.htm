                                              would like to make two preliminary 
                                              remarks. In my 34 years of 
                                              practice at the Bar, I have seen 
                                              eight Chief Justices since 
                                              independence; four were sacked, 
                                              one left to become President, two 
                                              retired, and the eighth is at 
                                              post. Of the two who retired, one 
                                              asked for and got an extension of 
                                              time to stay on after attaining 
                                              the retiring age of 65 years. 
                                              Tomorrow will be the eleventh 
                                              anniversary of the murder of the 
                                              three High Court judges, namely 
                                              Fred Poku Sarkodee, K A Agyepong 
                                              and Mrs Cecilia Koranteng-Addo. In 
                                              my funeral oration in 1982 as the 
                                              then President of the Ghana Bar 
                                              Association, I said: &quot;With the 
                                              murder of the three High Court 
                                              judges, the judiciary in Ghana 
                                              will not be the same again.&quot; I 
                                              would like to dedicate this 
                                              lecture to their memory. It is 
                                              against this background of 
                                              dismissals and murder that we 
                                              discuss the judiciary and its role 
                                              under the Fourth Republican

                                              The French political scientist, 
                                              Montesquieu, after studying the 
                                              writings of John Locke, propounded 
                                              in 1748 the doctrine of separation 
                                              of powers, ie legislative power, 
                                              executive power and judicial 
                                              power. He wrote: &quot;Political 
                                              liberty is to be found only . . . 
                                              when there is no abuse of power.&quot; 
                                              Montesquieu however noted that 
                                              &quot;constant experience shows us that 
                                              every man invested with power is 
                                              apt to abuse it, and to carry his 
                                              authority as far as it will go.&quot; 
                                              He suggested that to prevent this 
                                              abuse, &quot;power should be a check to 
                                              power.&quot;1 He continued:</span></p>

                                              executive powers are united in the 
                                              same person, or in the same body. 
                                              . . , there can be no liberty; . . 
                                              . Again, there is no liberty if 
                                              the judiciary power be not 
                                              separated from the legislative and

                                              his book, The Federalist, to mean

                                              This is not so in the United 
                                              Kingdom where cabinet ministers, 
                                              ie members of the executive, must 
                                              be members of Parliament, ie the 
                                              legislature. Indeed, they are 
                                              answerable to Parliament for the 
                                              way they run their ministries. The 
                                              Lord Chancellor, who is the 
                                              Speaker of the House of Lords, 
                                              acts in a judicial capacity as he 
                                              is the highest judge and sits as 
                                              the president of the highest 
                                              appellate tribunal, ie the House 
                                              of Lords. Some of the highest 
                                              judges are members of the second 
                                              chamber, ie the House of Lords. 
                                              Hence, by the Westminster 
                                              Constitution, the judiciary 
                                              intersects with the legislature 
                                              and the executive with the 
                                              legislature.</span></p>

                                              The Constitutional Commissions of 
                                              1968 and 1978 discussed the 
                                              doctrine of separation of powers, 
                                              whilst the 1968 Constitutional 
                                              Commission proposed the 
                                              Westminster system. The 1978 
                                              Constitutional Commission proposed 
                                              the presidential system of 
                                              government. Despite the fact that 
                                              the Constitutions, 1979 and 1992 
                                              do not observe strict separation 
                                              of powers, there is one thing 
                                              which all the three Constitutions 
                                              recognise, that is that &quot;the 
                                              judiciary has a vital and 
                                              indispensable role in the 
                                              constitutional process . . . and 
                                              that the courts are essential for 
                                              the operation of democratic and 
                                              constitutional government in

                                              The court held that the

                                              the coronation oath of the Queen 
                                              of England, did not constitute a 
                                              bill of rights and as such did not 
                                              create legal obligations 
                                              enforceable in a court of law. The

                                              dismissed the appeal. In In re

                                              courts, the way was open for the

                                              learnt that by sacrificing part of

                                              against his foes. As society

                                              which demands of the courts that

                                              murder in 1982 of the three High 
                                              Court judges, never to return. One
