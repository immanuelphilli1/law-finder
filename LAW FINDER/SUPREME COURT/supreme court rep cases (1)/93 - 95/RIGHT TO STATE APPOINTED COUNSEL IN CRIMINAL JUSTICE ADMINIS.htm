                                              The right to counsel as a 
                                              requirement for fair trial is one 
                                              of the fundamental human rights 
                                              guaranteed and entrenched under 
                                              the Constitution, 1992. Yet the 
                                              right to counsel has an uncertain 
                                              place in our criminal justice 
                                              system.&nbsp; In spite of their 
                                              rhetorics on fundamental human 
                                              rights and the rule of law, both 
                                              the bench and the Bar appear 
                                              married to the colonial system of 
                                              criminal justice where an indigent 
                                              accused or a person who has lost 
                                              his liberty cannot have a right to 
                                              state appointed counsel to assist 
                                              him at the pretrial or the trial 
                                              proceedings to obtain his liberty. 
                                              The only exception concerns trials 
                                              for the capital offence of murder. 
                                              This is the case in spite of new 
                                              developments in the metropolitan 
                                              colonial country during and after 
                                              the colonial period. This 
                                              conservatism of the judicial and 
                                              legal minds in failing to 
                                              recognise the modern democratic 
                                              principles of the rights against 
                                              self-incrimination, to legal aid 
                                              and due process may explain why 
                                              the fundamental human rights 
                                              provisions on the liberty of the 
                                              individual, respect for human 
                                              dignity, equality before the law,

                                              constitutional requirement of 
                                              state appointed counsel by the

                                              right to state appointed counsel.&nbsp;

                                              In 1931 the Court of Criminal 
                                              Appeal in England held that on an 
                                              indictment for rape, a prisoner 
                                              ought to be provided with 
                                              assistance of learned counsel.5 
                                              Similarly in 1942 Humpherys J 
                                              observed that it was desirable for 
                                              a prisoner charged with a sexual 
                                              offence to be represented by 
                                              counsel.6&nbsp; It is now the nature 
                                              and complexity of the crime that 
                                              determines whether an accused 
                                              ought to be assigned a state 
                                              appointed counsel, and a request 
                                              for one by the accused is not a 
                                              necessary condition for the 
                                              assignment of such counsel.7 And 
                                              in 1942 the Supreme Court of 
                                              United States in Powell v Alabama8 
                                              unequivocably declared that the 
                                              right to the aid of a counsel was 
                                              of a fundamental character. </span>

                                              Supreme Court reaffirmed the

                                              These developments in criminal

                                              of the powerful resources of the 
                                              state apparatus vis-à-vis the weak 
                                              position of the individual or

                                              liberty. A casual acquaintance 
                                              with state power in developing 
                                              countries would indicate the 
                                              fundamental importance of 
                                              protecting the individual against 
                                              misuse or abuse of the state

                                              freedom and liberty. It is not 
                                              therefore surprising that the 
                                              Constitution, 1992 provides for 
                                              the right to counsel in pre-trial 
                                              proceedings in article 14(2). The 
                                              right to counsel at the trial is 
                                              provided [p.162] for in article

                                              being violative of the fundamental 
                                              human rights provisions and 
                                              article 294 of the Constitution. 
                                              It is argued that neither

                                              lawyer of his choice&quot; mean that 
                                              the accused person must pay for a 
                                              counsel of his choice. What in our 
                                              opinion ought to be the dimension 
                                              of the right to assistance of

                                              under article 294 is beyond the

                                              a rule of law applicable to two 
                                              incriminating police statements 
                                              voluntarily made by the accused 
                                              without being informed of his 
                                              right to consult counsel of his 
                                              own choice. His lordship also 
                                              relied on the principles 
                                              enunciated in Miranda v Arizona, 
                                              particularly the judgment of

                                              pre-trial statements taken from 
                                              arrested, restricted, detained or 
                                              accused persons.21 In this case 
                                              the objection to the admissibility 
                                              of the incriminating statements 
                                              was raised by counsel for the 
                                              accused when making a submission 
                                              of no case after the close of the 
                                              case for the prosecution. Since 
                                              the statements were the only 
                                              statements against the first 
                                              accused in the case, the objection 
                                              was upheld and he was not called 
                                              upon to make his defence.</span></p>

                                              decisions is that the state as a 
                                              generic person and the individual 
                                              must be equal before the law in 
                                              terms of their legal defence

                                              In Powell v Alabama the US Supreme 
                                              Court noted that even the 
                                              intelligent and educated layman 
                                              could not understand the skills of 
                                              the science of law. This applies 
                                              with greater force in a country 
                                              such as ours where the ratio of 
                                              population of educated laymen to 
                                              illiterate population is very low. 
                                              The United States has a higher 
                                              literacy ratio than most 
                                              developing countries within the 
                                              Anglo-American common law 
                                              jurisdiction.&nbsp; Its jurisprudence, 
                                              however, still requires the 
                                              services of state appointed 
                                              counsel as a way of protecting 
                                              their fundamental human rights and 
                                              freedoms. This requirement must 
                                              therefore be of even greater 
                                              importance in a developing country 
                                              such as ours with a largely 
                                              illiterate population which has 
                                              very little knowledge of how the 
                                              law works both in practice and in 
                                              theory. The only logical approach 
                                              would be to follow Miranda v 
                                              Arizona in holding that articles 
                                              14(2), 294 and the relevant 
                                              provisions of Act 372 cast a duty 
                                              on the state to provide a lawyer 
                                              to incarcerated persons who are 
                                              willing to accept one before any 
                                              statements are taken from them. 
                                              Otherwise the right provided for 
                                              by the Constitution would be 
                                              meaningless to the majority of the 
                                              urban poor and the ignorant rural 
                                              population.27</span></p>

                                              a district court.28 The procedure 
                                              to be followed at the preliminary 
                                              hearing is provided for in

                                              Even though the preliminary 
                                              hearing takes place before a court 
                                              of law, they are pre-trial

                                              assessors.29 The issue therefore 
                                              is whether the right to counsel, 
                                              with the accustomed incidents of 
                                              consultation and opportunity of 
                                              preparation for the trial, is a 
                                              sine qua non at the preliminary 
                                              hearing in view of the fact that 
                                              these proceedings take place 
                                              before a court.&nbsp; By the practice 
                                              of our courts a person indicted 
                                              for murder is assigned counsel for 
                                              his defence at the trial. There is 
                                              however no practice or decided 
                                              case which requires that a person 
                                              indicted for murder must be 
                                              represented by counsel at the 
                                              preliminary hearing. This has been 
                                              so in spite of the fact that the 
                                              conduct of an accused at the 
                                              preliminary hearing can facilitate 
                                              his conviction.30</span></p>

                                              the attendance of his witnesses, 
                                              if any, after he has identified 
                                              them to the court.34 In committing 
                                              the accused for trial the court is 
                                              to admit him to bail or remand him 
                                              into prison custody pending the

                                              respect of which an accused has an 
                                              election to be tried by jury or 
                                              assessors, the court is to ask the

                                              In spite of the fact that the 
                                              court is not to hear witnesses and 
                                              their cross-examination at this 
                                              stage of the proceedings, there is 
                                              no gainsaying that most accused 
                                              persons would not appreciate what 
                                              the form and content of an 
                                              indictment is under the Criminal 
                                              Procedure Code. The legislature 
                                              has also recognised the fact that 
                                              the accused may be unable to 
                                              understand the charge and to 
                                              address the court in reply to the 
                                              prosecution's address in 
                                              explanation of the charge. It has 
                                              therefore provided that a reply 
                                              may be made by the accused or on 
                                              his behalf.37&nbsp; Surely it is 
                                              envisaged that the person to make 
                                              the reply on behalf of the accused 
                                              is a lawyer who has a right of 
                                              audience before the court. It has 
                                              also been held that in order for a 
                                              committal court to commit an 
                                              accused for trial the 
                                              prosecution's evidential burden 
                                              disclosed on the face of the

                                              same as that placed on the 
                                              prosecution at the trial to 
                                              sustain a finding that the accused 
                                              has a case to answer.38 The 
                                              accused is also at liberty to 
                                              persuade the court to grant him 
                                              bail before committal. An accused 
                                              who does not understand the 
                                              implications of a trial by a jury

                                              The right to counsel we have 
                                              indicated includes the accustomed

                                              shows the importance of the

                                              The recognition by our appellate 
                                              courts of the dangers facing an 
                                              unrepresented accused person is 
                                              amply demonstrated in a series of 
                                              appellate judgments. In Avegavi v 
                                              The Republic43 the Court of Appeal 
                                              per Anin JA (as he then was) 
                                              stated that it was necessary in 
                                              practice for the trial judge to 
                                              warn an unrepresented accused that 
                                              he was going too far in his 
                                              cross-examination of the 
                                              prosecution witnesses and thereby 
                                              exposing himself to impeachment as 
                                              to his credit and antecedents. The 
                                              three appellants in the case were 
                                              [p.170] unrepresented by a lawyer 
                                              in a trial for robbery. They 
                                              elected to give evidence on their 
                                              own behalf. They each denied the 
                                              charge and also denied ever making 
                                              the confession statements 
                                              attributed to them. The third 
                                              accused during cross-examination 
                                              stated that he did not know if Sgt 
                                              Hanu concocted the statement which 
                                              he said the third accused had 
                                              made. He also stated that he never 
                                              begged Sgt Hanu or anyone that he 
                                              had done wrong. He stated further 
                                              that: &quot;I say Sgt Hanu had lied to 
                                              the court in what he had said 
                                              about me . . .&quot; The prosecution at 
                                              that point and in the presence of 
                                              the jury applied for leave to 
                                              cross-examine the first and third 
                                              appellants as to previous 
                                              convictions because the third 
                                              appellant had attacked the 
                                              character of Sgt Hanu, a 
                                              prosecution witness. Leave was 
                                              granted to prove the previous 
                                              convictions of the appellants. 
                                              Previous convictions for stealing 
                                              were duly proved on the next 
                                              adjourned date. They were 
                                              convicted. On appeal it was argued 
                                              that the trial court had no 
                                              justification to permit the 
                                              cross-examination of the first and 
                                              third appellants as to their 
                                              previous convictions and for the 
                                              proven convictions to be revealed 
                                              to the jury. The Court of Appeal 
                                              upheld the submissions and quashed 
                                              the convictions. One of the 
                                              grounds for quashing the 
                                              convictions was that because the 
                                              jury were erroneously apprised of 
                                              the previous convictions of the 
                                              first and third appellants before 
                                              the summing-up and consideration 
                                              of their verdict, there was a 
                                              substantial miscarriage of justice 
                                              and a denial of a fair trial for 
                                              all the appellants.</span></p>

                                              In Adusei II v The Republic44 the 
                                              accused was charged on two counts

                                              to section 208 of the Criminal 
                                              Code, 196045, and deceit of a 
                                              public officer contrary to section 
                                              251 of the same code. The accused 
                                              who pleaded not guilty was 
                                              represented by counsel on the day 
                                              his plea was taken. On that day

                                              senior state attorney was 
                                              responsible for the prosecution. 
                                              On the day the prosecution opened 
                                              its case and until the trial was 
                                              completed, the accused was

                                              the court had refused, after 
                                              several adjournments at the 
                                              request of counsel for the

                                              prosecution opened its case. In 
                                              attempting to meet the evidential 
                                              burden placed on the prosecution 
                                              the senior state attorney called 
                                              witnesses to prove the mens rea of 
                                              the accused by giving evidence to 
                                              the effect that the accused knew 
                                              that the contents of his 
                                              publications (his letters) were 
                                              false. By such false publications 
                                              he had intended to deceive a named 
                                              public officer. The senior state 
                                              attorney also led evidence to show 
                                              that the accused had a disposition 
                                              to commit crimes of a similar 
                                              nature as he had on previous 
                                              occasions made similar reports 
                                              against some of the prosecution 
                                              witnesses to their detriment. The 
                                              senior state attorney did not 
                                              however produce any evidence to 
                                              show that the accused was charged 
                                              with any offence in connection 
                                              with those reports. In the course

                                              custody for what he felt was 
                                              perjury without an opportunity for 
                                              the witness to explain his 
                                              conduct. The trial judge also not 
                                              only admitted evidence of the 
                                              accused's character but relied on 
                                              such evidence in his judgments. 
                                              The accused was consequently 
                                              convicted and sentenced on both 
                                              counts. On appeal to the High 
                                              Court against his conviction and 
                                              sentence his counsel submitted, 
                                              inter alia, that the trial judge 
                                              erred in admitting and relying on 
                                              the evidence of the accused's 
                                              character; and that there was a 
                                              miscarriage of justice as the 
                                              trial judge was influenced in his 
                                              judgment by the evidence of the 
                                              accused's past conduct. It was 
                                              held, allowing the appeal, that on 
                                              the facts of the case the evidence 
                                              of the accused's character was 
                                              inadmissible evidence and should 
                                              have been rejected.&nbsp; It was

                                              Drugs Act, 1961 (Act 64). The 
                                              accused who pleaded not guilty was 
                                              represented by counsel on the

                                              However, in Adu v The Republic50 
                                              an application for adjournment and 
                                              for a certified true copy of the 
                                              previous proceedings by a new 
                                              counsel engaged by the accused was 
                                              disregarded by the trial judge who 
                                              proceeded with the trial. The 
                                              appellant was consequently 
                                              unrepresented and he was convicted 
                                              and sentenced. His counsel 
                                              therefore appealed against the 
                                              conviction and sentence and 
                                              applied for bail pending appeal. 
                                              Granting the application for bail 
                                              the High Court held that the 
                                              provisions of sections 70(1) and 
                                              175(1) of Act 30 accentuated the 
                                              time-honoured right of an accused 
                                              person to engage his own counsel 
                                              to defend himself. If the court 
                                              therefore wilfully excluded or 
                                              prevented the accused's counsel 
                                              from representing him that would 
                                              amount to a denial of justice. It 
                                              was held further that on the facts 
                                              the trial judge must have been 
                                              aware that his refusal to grant an 
                                              adjournment [p.173] would work 
                                              injustice to the appellant, he 
                                              therefore exercised his discretion 
                                              wrongly.</span></p>

                                              Those cases were decided when the 
                                              Constitution, 1969 was suspended.&nbsp; 
                                              However, the Courts Act, 1971 (Act 
                                              372), s 110 which was enacted 
                                              pursuant to the Constitution, 1969 
                                              particularly article 171 dealing 
                                              with legal aid, empowered the 
                                              courts, under certain conditions, 
                                              to grant legal aid to indigent 
                                              accused if the interest of justice 
                                              so required.51 These provisions 
                                              survived the suspension, and 
                                              later, the abrogation of the 
                                              Constitution, 1969. The courts 
                                              have, however,&nbsp; never exercised 
                                              the power to appoint counsel for 
                                              indigent accused in the interest

                                              required by the law. It does not 
                                              appear that lawyers have thought 
                                              of the importance of this limited 
                                              provision on the right to counsel. 
                                              They have therefore failed to 
                                              raise the issue of an indigent's 
                                              right to counsel in the relevant 
                                              cases. The right to counsel 
                                              continues to be limited to murder 
                                              trials which originates from a 
                                              long standing practice of the 
                                              courts and not a creature of 
                                              statute.52&nbsp; Even if section 110 of 
                                              Act 372 were not on our statute 
                                              books, we would still be of the 
                                              view that the attitude of the

                                              for indigent accused person is

                                              aid in matters relating to the 
                                              enforcement of these rights. The 
                                              foregoing submissions are further 
                                              reinforced by article 19(2) of the 
                                              Constitution which mandatorily 
                                              requires that an accused be 
                                              provided with the services of an 
                                              interpreter without payment by 
                                              him. If at such preliminary stage 
                                              of a criminal proceeding the state 
                                              is required to pay for such a 
                                              service, then there seems to be no 
                                              tangible reason for denying the 
                                              accused the right to state 
                                              appointed counsel. This view is 
                                              further fossilised by the 
                                              mandatory provision of counsel to 
                                              persons who reasonably require one 
                                              for purposes of enforcing their 
                                              rights in relation to a provision 
                                              of the Constitution.&nbsp; If this were 
                                              not so one may ask what the need 
                                              is to inform a person arrested, 
                                              restricted or detained of his 
                                              right to a lawyer of his choice.55 
                                              The requirement that a person 
                                              charged with an offence is to be 
                                              informed in detail of the nature 
                                              of the offence charged; to be 
                                              given adequate time and facilities 
                                              for the preparation of his 
                                              defence; and to be permitted to 
                                              defend himself in person or by a 
                                              lawyer of his choice56 stems from 
                                              the recognition of the fact that a 
                                              large percentage of the population 
                                              is illiterate and do not therefore 
                                              read or understand the English 
                                              language. In such a situation the 
                                              services of counsel are 
                                              indispensable to a fair trial. But 
                                              where the accused has not the 
                                              wherewithal to defend himself, the 
                                              right would become meaningless 
                                              and, hence the need for state 
                                              appointed counsel. Such a 
                                              situation is also true of the 
                                              intelligent and educated layman 
                                              who has sometimes no skill in the 
                                              science of law. The framers of the 
                                              Constitution, 1992 are rational 
                                              and intended what is responsible. 
                                              The framers of the Constitution 
                                              cannot therefore be said to have 
                                              ignored the fundamental right to a 
                                              lawyer in defending rights 
                                              threatened to be invaded under the 
                                              Constitution. It is for this 
                                              reason that provision is made 
                                              under article 294 in such 
                                              unambiguous terms for the 
                                              enforcement and defence of 
                                              fundamental human rights.</span></p>

                                              Our Constitution is modelled 
                                              largely along the lines of the 
                                              United States Constitution even 
                                              though ours contains unnecessary 
                                              details. It would therefore be 
                                              instructive to refer to the United 
                                              States constitutional case of 
                                              Gideon v Wainwright57 where the 
                                              right of an accused person to be 
                                              provided with state appointed 
                                              counsel was discussed. Black J

                                              Supreme Court made the following

                                              &quot;. . . The fact is that in 
                                              deciding as it did—that 
                                              'appointment of counsel is not a 
                                              fundamental right, essential to a 
                                              fair trial'—the court in Betts v 
                                              Brandy made an abrupt break with 
                                              its own well-considered 
                                              precedents. In returning to these 
                                              old precedents, sounder we believe 
                                              than the new, we but restore 
                                              constitutional principles 
                                              established to achieve a fair 
                                              system of justice. Not only these 
                                              precedents but also reason and 
                                              reflection require us to recognise 
                                              that in our adversary system of 
                                              criminal justice, any person haled 
                                              into court, who is too poor to 
                                              hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a 
                                              fair trial unless counsel is 
                                              provided for him. This seems to us 
                                              to be an obvious truth. 
                                              Government, both state and 
                                              federal, quite properly spend vast 
                                              sums of money to establish 
                                              machinery to try defendants 
                                              accused of crime. Lawyers to 
                                              prosecute are everywhere deemed 
                                              essential to protect the public's 
                                              interest in an orderly society.&nbsp; 
                                              Similarly, there are few 
                                              defendants charged with crime, few 
                                              indeed, who fail to hire the best 
                                              lawyers they can get to prepare 
                                              and present their defenses. That 
                                              government hires lawyers to 
                                              prosecute and defendants who have 
                                              the money hire lawyers to defend 
                                              are the strongest indications of 
                                              the widespread belief that lawyers 
                                              in criminal courts are 
                                              necessities, not luxuries. The 
                                              right of one charged with crime to 
                                              counsel may not be deemed 
                                              fundamental and essential to fair 
                                              trials in some countries, but it 
                                              is in ours . . . This noble ideal 
                                              cannot be realised if the poor man 
                                              charged with crime has to face his 
                                              accusers without a lawyer to 
                                              assist him . . .&quot;58</span></p>

                                              We have argued that an indigent

                                              jury or assessors. However, by the 
                                              scheme of our Criminal Procedure 
                                              Code a summary offence does not 
                                              connote a misdemeanour or a less 
                                              serious offence. It is an offence 
                                              which the enactment creating it 
                                              makes punishable on summary 
                                              conviction and provides no other 
                                              mode of trial.65&nbsp; Thus, even 
                                              though robbery is triable 
                                              summarily by the circuit court, 
                                              the High Court or [p.178]&nbsp; public 
                                              tribunal, the penalty for the 
                                              offence is life imprisonment or 
                                              death.66 Where the enactment 
                                              creating the offence does not 
                                              state the mode of trial but the 
                                              maximum penalty on first 
                                              conviction does not exceed six 
                                              months, it must be tried 
                                              summarily.67 On the other hand an 
                                              offence must be tried on 
                                              indictment if the penalty upon 
                                              conviction is death or it is one 
                                              declared by law to be a first 
                                              degree felony.68 In addition to 
                                              the foregoing, there are several 
                                              offences which may be tried by one 
                                              or the other mode of trial because 
                                              they have not been specified to be 
                                              triable either summarily or on 
                                              indictment.69 The manner in which 
                                              to proceed with a trial in this 
                                              third category of offences is left 
                                              to the discretion of the 
                                              Attorney-General.70 Thus a second 
                                              degree felony may be tried either 
                                              summarily or on indictment — the 
                                              minimum penalty to be imposed 
                                              notwithstanding.71 The general 
                                              understanding that summary 
                                              offences are offences of a less 
                                              serious character while indictable 
                                              offences comprise all offences of 
                                              a serious character is not 
                                              applicable to our Criminal Code 
                                              and Criminal Procedure Code.72 
                                              This being the case it does not 
                                              appear that the distinction 
                                              between felonies which gives rise 
                                              to right to counsel and 
                                              misdemeanours which do not, can 
                                              find a place in our criminal 
                                              jurisprudence.73</span></p>

                                              In Argersinger, the petitioner, an 
                                              indigent accused was charged with 
                                              carrying a concealed weapon under 
                                              Florida law. The offence is 
                                              punishable by imprisonment of up 
                                              to six months, or a fine of $1,000 
                                              or both. The trial was before a 
                                              judge without a jury and the 
                                              petitioner was unrepresented by 
                                              [p.179] counsel. He was sentenced 
                                              to 90 days imprisonment. He 
                                              petitioned the Supreme Court of 
                                              Florida by habeas corpus, alleging 
                                              that he had been deprived of his 
                                              right to counsel. He was 
                                              consequently unable as an indigent 
                                              layman properly to raise and 
                                              present to the trial court good 
                                              and sufficient defences to the 
                                              charge against him. The Supreme 
                                              Court of Florida by a majority of 
                                              four to three held that the right 
                                              to court-appointed counsel 
                                              extended only to trials &quot;for 
                                              non-petty offences punishable by 
                                              more than six months' 
                                              imprisonment.&quot; The petitioner 
                                              petitioned the Supreme Court of 
                                              the United States for certiorari 
                                              which was granted reversing the 
                                              decision of the Supreme Court of 
                                              Florida. It was held that the 
                                              right to counsel might well be 
                                              necessary for a fair trial in 
                                              petty offences prosecution because 
                                              the legal and constitutional 
                                              questions involved in a case that 
                                              actually led to imprisonment even 
                                              for a brief period were not only 
                                              less complex than when a person 
                                              could be imprisoned for six months 
                                              or more. The requirement of a fair 
                                              trial might necessitate the 
                                              presence of a lawyer even in 
                                              prosecutions for offences less 
                                              serious than felonies. The Supreme 
                                              Court was of the opinion that even 
                                              on arraignment where an accused 
                                              pleaded guilty, &quot;a problem which 
                                              looms large in misdemeanour as 
                                              well as felony cases&quot;, was that 
                                              the accused needed counsel so that 
                                              he might know precisely what he 
                                              was doing in terms of the 
                                              prospects of going to jail or 
                                              prison.&nbsp; This also enabled him to 
                                              be treated fairly by the 
                                              prosecution. To avoid the 
                                              obsession for speedy dispositions 
                                              of misdemeanours regardless of the 
                                              fairness of the result, the court 
                                              concluded that the problems 
                                              associated with misdemeanour and 
                                              petty offences often required the 
                                              presence of counsel to ensure the 
                                              accused a fair trial. The court 
                                              however did not consider it 
                                              necessary to answer Powel J's 
                                              query whether the right to counsel 
                                              is applicable to situations where 
                                              there is no prospect of 
                                              imprisonment.&nbsp; It's decision thus 
                                              appears to be limited to the 
                                              situation where loss of liberty is 
                                              involved as in the case under 
                                              consideration in which the

                                              under the Law is a privilege and

                                              well have been disposed of [p.181]

                                              previous Constitutions, and the 
                                              present Constitution, 1992 confer 
                                              a right to counsel on an indigent 
                                              accused. The right to counsel as 
                                              we have attempted to show is a 
                                              reasonable requirement for an 
                                              indigent person who has to enforce 
                                              his fundamental right of personal 
                                              liberty, respect for human 
                                              dignity, equality before the law,

                                              prospect of imprisonment may well 
                                              result in quite serious 
                                              repercussions affecting the

                                              human rights and freedoms and 
                                              ought to be defended vigorously by

                                              negroes charged with the rape of 
                                              two white girls. They were

                                              jury, and in its discretion may 
                                              range from ten years imprisonment 
                                              to death. The jury found the 
                                              defendants guilty and imposed the 
                                              death penalty upon all. The 
                                              defendants were sentenced

                                              right of counsel, with the 
                                              accustomed incidents of

                                              which qualified members of their

                                              case in which the defendant was 
                                              indicted for robbery in the 
                                              Circuit Court of Carroll County, 
                                              Maryland.&nbsp; Due to lack of funds, 
                                              he was unable to employ counsel. 
                                              He informed the judge at his

                                              that it was not the practice in

                                              witness stand himself. He was 
                                              convicted and sentenced to eight
