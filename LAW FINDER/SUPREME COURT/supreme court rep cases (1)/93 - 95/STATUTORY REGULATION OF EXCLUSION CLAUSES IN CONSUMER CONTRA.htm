                                              The Sale of Goods Act, 1962 (Act 
                                              137) creates a number of duties 
                                              which are statutorily imposed on a 
                                              seller under every contract of 
                                              sale and in specific cases 
                                              prohibits or restricts the use of 
                                              exclusion clauses to avoid those 
                                              implied terms. On the issue of the 
                                              quality of goods section 13 of Act 
                                              137 imposes on every seller of 
                                              goods the duty to ensure that the 
                                              goods are free from any defects 
                                              unknown to the buyer; and further 
                                              to ensure that the goods are 
                                              reasonably fit for the purpose for 
                                              which they are required.42 To 
                                              prevent sellers from avoiding the 
                                              liability imposed by section 13 of 
                                              the Act, the Act limits the power 
                                              of the seller to exclude these 
                                              implied terms&nbsp; by any exclusion or 
                                              exemption clause, even though the 
                                              limitation is not absolute.43 A 
                                              trader or dealer in goods of a 
                                              particular description cannot 
                                              effectively exclude liability for 
                                              the poor quality of goods supplied 
                                              unless &quot;he proves that before the 
                                              contract was made the exclusion 
                                              clause was brought to the notice 
                                              of the buyer and its effect made 
                                              clear to him.&quot;44&nbsp; This provision 
                                              appears to undermine the 
                                              protection afforded to the 
                                              consumer with respect to the 
                                              quality of the goods since it 
                                              allows the seller to avoid 
                                              liability as long as he points out 
                                              the exclusion clause to the 
                                              customer.</span></p>

                                              It must also be noted that the 
                                              limitation on the use of exclusion 
                                              clauses to exclude liability for 
                                              poor quality of goods does not 
                                              apply to purely private sales, 
                                              where the seller does not sell the 
                                              particular type of goods in the 
                                              ordinary course of his business. 
                                              However, with the liberal 
                                              interpretation traditionally given 
                                              to the phrase &quot;in the ordinary 
                                              course of business&quot;, it is only in 
                                              very limited situations that a 
                                              seller would be able to 
                                              unilaterally exclude his liability 
                                              for the poor quality of goods 
                                              supplied.Even though there is no 
                                              Ghanaian case which has directly 
                                              interpreted this phrase, a number 
                                              of English cases which have 
                                              construed an identical provision

                                              have given it a very wide scope.45</span></p>

                                              for the intended purpose. It was 
                                              held nevertheless that the duty 
                                              arose since the product was of the 
                                              description which the sellers sold 
                                              in the ordinary course of their 
                                              business, notwithstanding that 
                                              they manufactured it for the very 
                                              first time for this particular 
                                              purpose. In Ashington Piggeries 
                                              Ltd v Christopher Hill Ltd47 a 
                                              manufacturers of animal feed 
                                              compounds were asked to mix and 
                                              supply a compound to be used as 
                                              mink food according to 
                                              specifications agreed between them 
                                              and the buyers. When the sellers 
                                              delivered a compound which was 
                                              unfit for the intended purpose, 
                                              they were held to be in beach even 
                                              though they had never supplied 
                                              this particular compound before.</span></p>

                                              This liberal approach, if adopted 
                                              by the Ghanaian courts, would 
                                              effectively expand the scope of 
                                              the seller's liability and ensure 
                                              that wider protection is given to 
                                              the purchaser of goods who relies

                                              be noted that since section 13 of 
                                              Act 137 does not require that the 
                                              purchaser must have exhibited any 
                                              form of reliance on the trader's 
                                              expertise, the protection in 
                                              section 13(1)(b) could be invoked 
                                              even if the purchaser, by reason 
                                              of his occupation, skill or 
                                              expertise, is in fact more

                                              The core question, however, is 
                                              precisely what must be done by the 
                                              seller in order to ensure that the

                                              specifically or expressly inform 
                                              the buyer of the existence of the 
                                              clause (ie, read it out to him) 
                                              and explain to the buyer in a

                                              contract? The latter 
                                              interpretation is more likely and 
                                              if applied would require in our 
                                              circumstances that the exemption 
                                              clause be explained to an 
                                              illiterate consumer or buyer in a

                                              understanding. In the case of 
                                              literate purchasers, the clause, 
                                              presumably, must not only be 
                                              clearly printed on the contractual 
                                              document but must be pointed out 
                                              to the purchaser and its effect

                                              Holding Corporation.48 The 
                                              plaintiff, an illiterate person, 
                                              took his boat to the defendant's

                                              the usual terms and conditions.

                                              their store and gave the propeller

                                              The plaintiff returned with the 
                                              repaired propeller shaft only to 
                                              be informed that the propeller 
                                              blade was nowhere to be found and 
                                              therefore the shaft could not be 
                                              fitted on the plaintiffs boat. It 
                                              took the plaintiff 44 days to 
                                              obtain another blade to replace 
                                              the lost one. The plaintiff 
                                              thereafter brought an action 
                                              claiming damages for loss of use 
                                              of the vessel for the 44 days, due 
                                              to the negligence of the 
                                              defendants. The defendants relied 
                                              on an exclusion clause written in 
                                              English on their notice board to 
                                              avoid liability for the loss of 
                                              the plaintiff's propeller blade. 
                                              The court found that the exemption 
                                              clause was not effective because 
                                              there was no evidence that the 
                                              notice, which was written in 
                                              English, was explained to the 
                                              plaintiff, an illiterate person,

                                              followed here. The broad effect of 
                                              section 13 of Act 137 applied in 
                                              this context is thus to clearly 
                                              discourage the rampant use of 
                                              contractual clauses to exclude 
                                              liability for poor quality goods 
                                              by insisting on explicit 
                                              explanations of such clauses to 
                                              customers.</span></p>

                                              price of £G2,400. At a time when

                                              on section 76 of the Act, that 
                                              under the agreement they had the

                                              not completely contract. In this 
                                              case the issue was whether the

                                              provision in the agreement which 
                                              allowed the owner to recover 
                                              possession of the motor vehicle

                                              the Act, their rights and 
                                              liabilities had to be ascertained 
                                              exclusively from their written 
                                              agreement without reference to the 
                                              restrictions contained generally

                                              rejected by the court when it held 
                                              that the parties to a contract for 
                                              the sale of goods do not have the 
                                              right to contract out of the 
                                              provisions of Act 137 so as to 
                                              permit their obligations to be 
                                              regulated exclusively by the terms 
                                              of their own agreement. Even where 
                                              the parties had opted to contract 
                                              out of Part VIII of Act 137, the 
                                              rights and liabilities of the 
                                              parties thereto should be governed 
                                              by the terms of their agreement as 
                                              far as are consistent with other 
                                              provisions of Act 137, out of 
                                              which they cannot completely 
                                              contract.</span></p>

                                              The cumulative effect of these 
                                              statutory restrictions as 
                                              interpreted by the Ghanaian courts 
                                              is clearly to discourage the use 
                                              of widely drawn and unconscionable

                                              been quite vigilant in restricting 
                                              the use of such clauses, 
                                              particularly in consumer credit 
                                              transactions where the inequality

                                              distinct and there is greater

                                              implied terms as to merchantable 
                                              quality shall not be effective

                                              exclusion clause was brought to 
                                              the notice of the hirer or buyer 
                                              and its effect made clear to him. 
                                              Where the exclusion clause is in 
                                              relation to any defect, it must be

                                              The plaintiff's action was brought 
                                              not against the company but 
                                              against the master and the

                                              boatswain were negligent in 
                                              setting up the gangway and were 
                                              not entitled to rely on the 
                                              exemption clause contained in the 
                                              plaintiff's ticket. The conditions 
                                              set out there were conditions of 
                                              the contract between the plaintiff 
                                              and the company, and the company's

                                              In Ghana, the common law principle 
                                              on privity has been substantially 
                                              modified by section 5(1) of the 
                                              Contracts Act, 1960 (Act 25) which 
                                              allows a person to rely on or 
                                              enforce a contract to which he is 
                                              not a party once it is established 
                                              that the contract purports 
                                              expressly or impliedly to confer a 
                                              benefit on him.60 The Act, 
                                              however, is careful to make an 
                                              exception to this rule in the case 
                                              of exclusion clauses. In section 
                                              5(2) (b) it states that the 
                                              provision in section 5(1) does not 
                                              apply to: &quot;A provision in a 
                                              contract purporting to exclude or 
                                              restrict any liability of a person 
                                              who is not a party thereto.&quot; In 
                                              other words, a person who is not a 
                                              party to a contract cannot rely on 
                                              any exclusion clause contained in 
                                              it, whether or not the clause 
                                              purports to exclude such a third 
                                              party from liability. This 
                                              provision amounts to an absolute 
                                              ban on the exclusion of liability 
                                              of persons who are strangers to 
                                              the contract (including the 
                                              contracting party's servants, 
                                              agents or employees) for 
                                              negligence. The Ghanaian statutory 
                                              position prevents suppliers from

                                              decision by the express mention of 
                                              servants or employees in exclusion 
                                              clauses. With the protection 
                                              provided in section 5(2)(b) of the 
                                              Contracts Act, a consumer, in the 
                                              event of breach, would still be

                                              for negligence even if there is a

                                              is required to achieve a higher 
                                              level of protection in actual 
                                              practice for consumers. Drawing 
                                              from the experience of other legal 
                                              jurisdictions, it has been 
                                              observed that two broad approaches 
                                              have typically been employed in 
                                              the regulation of exclusion 
                                              clauses in consumer contracts, 
                                              with emphasis being placed on one 
                                              or the other.</span></p>

                                              The first is the effective 
                                              legislative control of the terms 
                                              of various categories of consumer 
                                              contracts through the prescription 
                                              of the core provisions and the 
                                              restriction of the use of 
                                              exclusion clauses for certain 
                                              kinds of conduct. The second 
                                              approach is the active approach 
                                              involving the creation of an 
                                              office or commission charged with 
                                              investigating market practices and 
                                              scrutinising the terms of

                                              practices and the use of

                                              proposed in Ghana in 1993 
                                              advocates extensive legislative 
                                              control of contract clauses and 
                                              business practices which are

                                              are expressly prohibited, and 
                                              broad guidelines are given for

                                              found that even though the staves 
                                              exceeded the specified thickness, 
                                              they were &quot;commercially within and

                                              The House of Lords held that the 
                                              fact that the goods were 
                                              merchantable under the contract 
                                              was not the proper test to be 
                                              applied in determining whether the 
                                              goods satisfied the contract 
                                              description or not and was of the 
                                              view that the finding as to 
                                              measurement showed that the goods 
                                              were not those contracted to be 
                                              sold and therefore the buyers were 
                                              entitled to reject them. This 
                                              position was defended by Lord 
                                              Atkin in the following words:</span></p>

                                              &quot;It was contended that in all 
                                              commercial contracts the question 
                                              was whether there was a 
                                              'substantial' compliance with the 
                                              contract:&nbsp; there always must be 
                                              some margin: and it is for the 
                                              tribunal of fact to determine 
                                              whether the margin is exceeded or 
                                              not. I cannot agree. If the 
                                              written contract specifies 
                                              conditions of weight, measurement 
                                              and the like, those conditions 
                                              must be complied with. A ton does 
                                              not mean about a ton or a yard 
                                              about a yard. Still less when you 
                                              descend to minute measurements 
                                              does ½ inch mean about ½ inch. If 
                                              the seller wants a margin he must 
                                              and in my experience does 
                                              stipulate for it. Of course by 
                                              recognized trade usage particular 
                                              figures may be given a different 
                                              meaning, as in baker's dozen; or 
                                              there may be even incorporated a 
                                              definite margin more or less: but 
                                              there is no evidence or finding of 
                                              such a usage in the present 
                                              case.&quot;72a</span></p>

                                              The drawback of this rigid 
                                              approach was said to be that it 
                                              allowed buyers to play fast and 
                                              loose and reject goods at the 
                                              slightest pretext of non

                                              The drafters of the Ghanaian Sale 
                                              of Goods Act declined to follow 
                                              this position, and instead sought 
                                              to achieve some kind of balance so 
                                              as to encourage the performance of 
                                              sale contracts by both parties, 
                                              while yet safeguarding the buyer's 
                                              right of rejection for genuine 
                                              breaches. The provision in section 
                                              49(1)(b) was employed to achieve 
                                              this balance. It is interesting to 
                                              note that the underlying 
                                              philosophy of the approach of the 
                                              Ghanaian Sale of Goods Act is 
                                              strikingly close to that espoused 
                                              by the English courts in the 
                                              modern classification of 
                                              contractual terms into conditions,

                                              and in the determination of when

                                              It is however doubtful that this 
                                              innovative approach in determining 
                                              the consequences of breach would 
                                              be of much significance in actual 
                                              practice. Even though to date 
                                              there has not been any case in 
                                              which the Ghanaian courts have 
                                              been called upon to make such an 
                                              assessment, it is quite obvious 
                                              that an objective determination of 
                                              whether a breach is serious or 
                                              trivial to a particular buyer 
                                              would not be easy to make.75 Where 
                                              there is a dispute it is more 
                                              likely than not that the court 
                                              would feel compelled to uphold the 
                                              claim of the buyer who insists 
                                              that a particular breach has 
                                              affected him adversely. It must 
                                              also be noted that the purchaser's 
                                              alternative if he is denied the 
                                              right of rejection would be a 
                                              claim for damages only.76 This 
                                              however is not likely to be very 
                                              useful to him in actual practice, 
                                              for if a purchaser cannot reject 
                                              goods because the breach is 
                                              trivial, it is unlikely that the 
                                              award of damages would be 
                                              substantial since the 
                                              determination that the breach is

                                              seller, or does not within a

                                              substantially the same condition

                                              the determination of whether or

                                              in the flour trade and in addition 
                                              had a special cover clause which 
                                              stated as follows: &quot;warranted free

                                              bank draft were, in due course, 
                                              delivered to the plaintiff. This 
                                              ship arrived at Takoradi and the 
                                              plaintiff, while in the process of 
                                              removing the bags of flour from 
                                              the habour to his warehouse, 
                                              noticed that 339 bags of flour 
                                              were caked and also found upon 
                                              internal examination of 10 bags 
                                              that they were infested with

                                              the Lloyd's agent for a survey 
                                              which was carried out and 
                                              confirmed that the flour was 
                                              weevil infested. The Lloyd's agent 
                                              however did not think that the 
                                              flour was all that bad and 
                                              suggested sifting, but the 
                                              plaintiff rejected this 
                                              suggestion, being of the view that 
                                              the flour was not fit for human 
                                              consumption.</span></p>

                                              At the suggestion of the agent the 
                                              plaintiff asked the Port Health 
                                              Officer to examine the goods to 
                                              decide whether the flour was fit 
                                              for human consumption or not. Upon 
                                              examination of the flour, the Port 
                                              Health Officer expressed the 
                                              opinion that the flour was not fit 
                                              for human consumption. The 
                                              plaintiff thereupon surrendered 
                                              the 2,000 bags of flour to the 
                                              health authorities for destruction 
                                              and wrote to the defendants 
                                              advising them that the 2,000 bags 
                                              of flour were unfit for human 
                                              consumption and therefore had to 
                                              be destroyed. He later instituted 
                                              an action in the High Court 
                                              against them claiming the cost, 
                                              insurance and freight value of the 
                                              flour as damages for breach of 
                                              contract for the sale of the 2,000 
                                              bags of flour to him and, in the 
                                              alternative, money paid for a 
                                              consideration which had totally 
                                              failed. The trial judge gave 
                                              judgment for the plaintiff and the 
                                              defendants appealed to the Supreme

                                              buyer had no right of rejection 
                                              since the sellers had performed

                                              follows logically that the

                                              The view adopted by the Supreme

                                              possible steps to indicate his 
                                              rejection of the flour which was 
                                              apparently in a deplorable state. 
                                              The act of surrendering the bags 
                                              of flour for destruction seemed to 
                                              have been the ultimate and 
                                              inevitable thing to do upon having 
                                              made his intention to reject quite 
                                              clear. In the circumstances of 
                                              this case it is difficult to see 
                                              how the act of surrendering 
                                              defective goods for destruction as 
                                              required by the regulations of the

                                              In a number of cases the courts 
                                              have had to determine whether a 
                                              buyer has lost his right of 
                                              rejection by reason of lapse of a 
                                              reasonable time. In Rockson v 
                                              Armah,88 the appellant sold a 
                                              secondhand Mercedes Benz car to 
                                              the respondent. The respondent 
                                              made cash payments for part of the 
                                              purchase price and remitted two 
                                              post-dated cheques for the balance 
                                              of the price. Upon delivery the 
                                              car was found to have been 
                                              involved in an accident and had 
                                              suffered considerable damage. The 
                                              appellant accepted liability and 
                                              agreed to repair the car. 
                                              Consequently, the appellant 
                                              approached Messrs RT Briscoe to 
                                              effect the repairs but found their 
                                              estimates too high. The car was 
                                              eventually repaired by a &quot;wayside&quot; 
                                              fitter in a day and the respondent 
                                              took delivery. However, after the 
                                              respondent had used the car for 
                                              almost two months, he repudiated 
                                              the contract on the ground that he 
                                              had discovered some latent defects 
                                              in the car. The trial judge held 
                                              that the respondent was justified 
                                              in repudiating the contract. On 
                                              appeal against this decision, the 
                                              main issue for the consideration 
                                              of the court revolved around the 
                                              right of a purchaser to repudiate 
                                              a sale upon the discovery of 
                                              latent defects.</span></p>

                                              It was held, allowing the appeal, 
                                              that even if the purchaser had the 
                                              right to reject the vehicle, that 
                                              right was lost by unreasonable 
                                              delay. What amounted to reasonable 
                                              time was a question of fact and 
                                              might vary with the circumstances 
                                              of a case, but in the court's view 
                                              the retention of a secondhand car 
                                              for almost two months was 
                                              unreasonable and it was not 
                                              thereafter open to the respondent 
                                              to avoid the transaction.</span></p>

                                              In Armah v Baffour,89 the 
                                              plaintiff sold his &quot;home-used&quot; or 
                                              secondhand Bedford engine to the 
                                              defendant under a written 
                                              agreement. The defendant agreed to 
                                              make part-payment immediately and 
                                              to pay the rest of the amount in 
                                              weekly instalments. The engine was 
                                              tested to the defendant's 
                                              satisfaction before he took 
                                              delivery of it. Subsequently, the 
                                              defendant defaulted on the payment 
                                              terms. The plaintiff sued for the 
                                              payment of the balance of [p.131] 
                                              ¢180,000 together with interest 
                                              and damages. The defendant 
                                              resisted the claim and pleaded 
                                              that the plaintiff had 
                                              fraudulently represented to him 
                                              that the engine was brand new and 
                                              faultless. He had however 
                                              discovered a fault on the engine 
                                              and had to repair it at a cost of 
                                              ¢20,000. He tendered two receipts 
                                              for the repairs on the engine. The 
                                              defendant therefore sought to 
                                              repudiate the transaction and 
                                              counterclaimed for damages. The 
                                              court found, however, that after 
                                              the purchase the defendant had 
                                              installed the secondhand engine on 
                                              the vehicle and carried out the 
                                              repairs on the vehicle after using

                                              his right to reject it. It was 
                                              held that on the facts the 
                                              defendant's conduct was more 
                                              consistent with a willingness and 
                                              readiness to accept the Bedford 
                                              engine by keeping the engine for a 
                                              period upwards of five months 
                                              after he had discovered the latent 
                                              defects and the transaction was 
                                              therefore binding on him.</span></p>

                                              lapse was determined from when the 
                                              purchaser found that the goods 
                                              were in fact defective. The 
                                              question could however arise 
                                              whether time should be made to run 
                                              from the time of delivery of the 
                                              goods, the time the defects 
                                              appeared in the goods or when the 
                                              defects were actually discovered 
                                              by the buyer. What if the defects 
                                              in the product appeared six months 
                                              after its purchase, or what if the 
                                              purchaser began to use the product 
                                              one year after it was bought and 
                                              it was only then that he noticed 
                                              the defect?</span></p>

                                              Pamson Motors (Golders Green) 
                                              Ltd90 the plaintiff purchased a 
                                              new Nissan Laurel car on 7 
                                              December. As a result of illness 
                                              he had not driven the car much. He 
                                              had only driven 100 miles to 
                                              accustom himself to the controls 
                                              and was on his first substantial 
                                              trip the following 2 January when 
                                              the car broke down, it having done 
                                              only about 140 miles. It was found 
                                              that a manufacturing defect had 
                                              caused sealant to enter the 
                                              lubrication system and cut off the 
                                              oil supply to the camshaft, which 
                                              broke down completely. The 
                                              plaintiff sought to reject the car 
                                              on the ground that it was not of

                                              found that the buyer was too late

                                              rejection was barred reasonably 
                                              soon after the completion of the

                                              defect and the speed with which it 
                                              might have been discovered were 
                                              not relevant to the determination

                                              The provision in section 13 has 
                                              been described as one of the most 
                                              innovative legislative 
                                              achievements in Ghanaian sales 
                                              law.93 The provision begins with a 
                                              statement of the caveat emptor 
                                              principle, creates an extensive 
                                              exception to it by introducing a 
                                              broad implied term, and stipulates 
                                              a number of limited situations in 
                                              which the implied term will not 
                                              apply. The general principle in 
                                              section 13, which is based on the 
                                              caveat emptor principle, is so 
                                              overshadowed by the exception that 
                                              the result is something close to a 
                                              complete negation of the caveat

                                              In practice, section 13 places a 
                                              very high responsibility on the 
                                              seller of goods with respect to 
                                              the quality of&nbsp; the goods, whether 
                                              as manufacturer, wholesaler or 
                                              retailer. It is significant to 
                                              note that in the case of latent 
                                              manufacturing defects a retailer 
                                              of goods would be in breach of the 
                                              implied condition even if he had 
                                              no means of knowing of the defect. 
                                              According to section 13, liability 
                                              for latent defects in goods sold 
                                              is only avoided where the goods 
                                              are not of the kind sold in the 
                                              ordinary course of the seller's 
                                              business, and the seller was not 
                                              aware and could not reasonably 
                                              have been aware of their 
                                              existence. Where the seller of the 
                                              goods is a trader dealing in goods 
                                              of that description, the liability 
                                              is almost strict. In the case of 
                                              latent defects which are not 
                                              easily discoverable upon 
                                              examination, the trader would in 
                                              all cases be liable, whether or 
                                              not he was aware of their 
                                              existence.</span></p>

                                              exhibits this trend. Particularly

                                              courts, for the most part, appear 
                                              to have ignored the provision in 
                                              section 13 and instead applied the 
                                              decisions of English cases which 
                                              are clearly at variance with our

                                              14(2) of the English Sale of Goods 
                                              Act of 1893 which employs the term 
                                              &quot;merchantable quality&quot;, is to the 
                                              effect that defects in a 
                                              secondhand car do not necessarily 
                                              render it unmerchantable. Under 
                                              English law, a secondhand car is 
                                              merchantable if it is in usable 
                                              condition, even though not 
                                              perfect, and the presence of 
                                              latent defects in such a car does 
                                              not impose any liability on the 
                                              seller, in the absence of an 
                                              express warranty. The wholesale 
                                              application of this dictum raised 
                                              some concern, considering that the 
                                              relevant provision under the 
                                              Ghanaian Sale of Goods Act does 
                                              not make any distinction in the 
                                              case of secondhand goods and does 
                                              not employ the &quot;merchantable 
                                              quality standard&quot; at all. As has 
                                              been pointed out the position 
                                              adopted by the court in this case 
                                              cannot be supported by the 
                                              provisions in the Act because 
                                              according to section 13 the only 
                                              way the appellant in Rockson v 
                                              Armah, not being a secondhand car 
                                              dealer himself, could have avoided 
                                              liability, was if he could show 
                                              that he did not in fact know of 
                                              the defects and could not 
                                              reasonably have known of their 
                                              existence.97</span></p>

                                              dealer, the Court of Appeal in the 
                                              case of Yirenkyi v Tormekpey98 
                                              followed the Rockson v Armah 
                                              approach in determining the issue 
                                              of when a buyer is entitled to

                                              of latent defects without making 
                                              any attempt to interpret and apply 
                                              the provisions of section 13 of 
                                              Act 137. The plaintiff bought a 
                                              secondhand Toyota truck for 
                                              ¢157,000 from the defendant, a 
                                              motor vehicle dealer. He then 
                                              spent ¢56,860 to make substantial 
                                              repairs to rehabilitate the truck. 
                                              Subsequently, the plaintiff 
                                              brought an action against the 
                                              defendant to recover both sums and 
                                              for damages for loss of use. He 
                                              pleaded that after taking delivery 
                                              of the truck he found that 
                                              contrary to the warranty given by 
                                              the defendant to him, the [p.135] 
                                              truck was not roadworthy, and that 
                                              the defendant then authorised him 
                                              to have the truck repaired and 
                                              promised to refund the cost of 
                                              repairs. The plaintiff further 
                                              claimed that as a result of the 
                                              defendant's failure to transfer 
                                              ownership of the truck to him, he 
                                              had not been able to use it and 
                                              had thereby suffered substantial 
                                              loss. The defendant admitted 
                                              receipt of the purchase price, but 
                                              denied having given the plaintiff 
                                              any warranty and claimed that 
                                              before the plaintiff bought the 
                                              truck he brought his own mechanic 
                                              to examine it. The trial judge 
                                              allowed the plaintiff's motion for 
                                              summary judgment on the grounds 
                                              that the plaintiff was entitled to 
                                              repudiate the contract, return the 
                                              vehicle and claim the refund 
                                              because the defendant was in 
                                              breach of the implied condition 
                                              under Act 137, s13(1)(b) that the 
                                              vehicle was reasonably fit for the 
                                              purpose it was required.</span></p>

                                              On appeal, it was held that the 
                                              trial judge was not entitled to 
                                              conclude without evidence that 
                                              there was a breach of warranty 
                                              that the vehicle (a secondhand 
                                              one) was reasonably fit for the 
                                              purpose for which it was required,

                                              the truck was not roadworthy, 
                                              deposed to by the plaintiff, was 
                                              denied by the defendant. The judge 
                                              should have admonished himself 
                                              that in buying a secondhand car, 
                                              defects might appear sooner or 
                                              later, and that in the absence of 
                                              an express warranty, the buyer had 
                                              no redress. And even if be bought

                                              The attitude of the courts however

                                              It is quite clear that there must 
                                              be a strengthening of legislative 
                                              control of the use of exclusion 
                                              clauses in consumer contracts. 
                                              Considering the level of adherence 
                                              to existing statutory 
                                              prescriptions for the use of 
                                              exclusion clauses, it would be 
                                              necessary to explore the 
                                              possibility of adopting a more 
                                              active approach by creating an 
                                              office which would be charged with 
                                              investigating business

                                              in common use. In striving to 
                                              achieve greater protection for 
                                              Ghanaian consumers, regard must be 
                                              had to the fact that the costs of 
                                              litigation are usually so 
                                              disproportionally high for the 
                                              purchaser (as compared to 
                                              suppliers of goods) that there is 
                                              little motivation to seek redress 
                                              for defects in goods purchased. 
                                              The setting up of a commission or 
                                              agency which would receive and 
                                              investigate such complaints at 
                                              little or no cost to consumers and

                                              practices would go a long way to 
                                              enhance consumer welfare. Such a 
                                              commission would be mandated to 
                                              establish alternative dispute 
                                              resolution procedures to obtain 
                                              redress for consumers in a 
                                              relatively cheap and informal
