                                              In 1989 the General Assembly of 
                                              the United Nations requested the 
                                              Secretary-General of the United 
                                              Nations to seek the views of 
                                              governments, United Nations 
                                              agencies and bodies as well as 
                                              human rights and non-governmental 
                                              organisations (NGOs) on the 
                                              desirability of convening a world 
                                              conference on the promotion and 
                                              protection of human rights. In 
                                              1990 the General Assembly decided 
                                              finally to convene such a 
                                              conference and preparations were 
                                              set in motion for the conference. 
                                              It was finally decided that the 
                                              conference should be held in 
                                              Vienna, Austria between 14 and 25 
                                              June 1993. This was to mark the 
                                              25th Anniversary of the 
                                              International Conference on Human 
                                              Rights which was held in Tehran, 
                                              Iran. Today, therefore, is the 
                                              last day for the 1993 United 
                                              Nations sponsored World Conference 
                                              on Human Rights. Significantly, 
                                              the Organisation of African Unity 
                                              (OAU) decided that a week devoted 
                                              to the consideration of human 
                                              rights issues should be observed 
                                              by all member states.</span></p>

                                              the OAU from 21-28 June 1993 in a 
                                              fitting manner by organising a

                                              Any discussions of human rights 
                                              inevitably raises the question of 
                                              what human rights really are. All 
                                              thinking on human rights has 
                                              proceeded from theories of natural 
                                              rights which themselves have 
                                              emerged from philosophical 
                                              thinking on natural law. The ideas 
                                              of Thomas Aquinas contained a lot 
                                              of material on medieval thought on 
                                              natural law and natural rights 
                                              which were conceived as a set of 
                                              immutable rights conferred on 
                                              individuals by reason of their 
                                              being creatures of God.1 
                                              Subsequent philosophers and 
                                              thinkers like [p.183] Grotius, who 
                                              was also the father of modern 
                                              public international law, and 
                                              Pufendorf developed the medieval 
                                              theories of natural law as 
                                              exemplified in the writings of 
                                              Thomas Aquinas into a system of 
                                              theories which, while not deriving

                                              measured against the principles of 
                                              natural law and to conform to them

                                              such as John Austin would deny the

                                              natural rights or human rights to

                                              enacted by a process of the

                                              The trouble about ideas of human

                                              laws can be measured is that they 
                                              depend to a large extent on the 
                                              setting up of a set of norms of

                                              of governments. Norm-setting is 
                                              described quite rightly as 
                                              depending to a large extent on the

                                              there is now considered to be a 
                                              third category of human rights, 
                                              namely such rights as the right to

                                              well as rights in relation to

                                              difficulties with this third 
                                              category of rights because many of 
                                              them are not really individual 
                                              human rights but rather group or 
                                              people’s rights. They are 
                                              collective rather than individual 
                                              rights. The rights which can

                                              individual human rights are those

                                              contained provisions on human

                                              Such an argument is, without any

                                              and proceeds upon the assumption 
                                              that all that is necessary to a 
                                              human being is a place of shelter, 
                                              clothes to wear and food to eat. 
                                              If that were so, human beings 
                                              would not be very different from

                                              tension are necessary

                                              economic development. The 
                                              enjoyment of human rights and 
                                              fundamental freedoms in the sense 
                                              of political and civil rights is 
                                              the goal of all economic and 
                                              social activity; and economic and 
                                              social well-being underpins the 
                                              enjoyment of political and civil 
                                              rights. Of the two categories of 
                                              rights, economic and social on the 
                                              one hand and the political and 
                                              civil on the other, none can be 
                                              said to be pre-eminent. Both sets 
                                              of rights are important for the 
                                              full realisation of the 
                                              individual’s potential as a human

                                              which they rule. Such leaders are,

                                              fundamental equality of all human 
                                              beings and to deny any inferiority

                                              They do not pause to consider what

                                              corollary of the fundamental 
                                              equality of human beings is in 
                                              relation to the enjoyment of those

                                              human. If all human beings are 
                                              equal, then they are entitled to 
                                              the enjoyment of the same rights 
                                              wherever they may be and whatever

                                              may be and whatever their level of

                                              The argument about the

                                              civil rights as well as of

                                              unanswerable. The absence of civil 
                                              and political rights creates a 
                                              situation which enables autocratic

                                              economic prosperity to prevent the

                                              alleged to be guaranteed by the 
                                              Constitution then such rights will

                                              As was noted earlier, except for a 
                                              few notable cases, the judiciary 
                                              in this country has woefully 
                                              failed the people in the matter of 
                                              the enforcement of their 
                                              fundamental human rights. In the 
                                              famous case of Re Akoto referred 
                                              to ealier,11 the court was called 
                                              upon to enforce a provision of the 
                                              Republican Constitution of 1960. 
                                              That provision, namely article 
                                              13(1), enjoined the President upon 
                                              the assumption of office to make a 
                                              solemn declaration of adherence to 
                                              the principles which were 
                                              described as &quot;fundamental&quot;. These 
                                              principles include the necessity 
                                              for the maintenance of freedom and 
                                              justice, and a restriction on the 
                                              deprivation of freedom of religion 
                                              or speech and of the right to move

                                              It is important to note that 
                                              article 13(2) of the Constitution, 
                                              1960 en- [p.192] trenched the 
                                              provision so that it could be 
                                              altered only by the people of 
                                              Ghana at a referendum or a special 
                                              exercise to ascertain their 
                                              wishes. One would have thought 
                                              that such a fundamental principle 
                                              is so important that it would make 
                                              sense and be of any use only if it 
                                              was enforceable by a legal 
                                              process. Yet the distinguished 
                                              members of the Supreme Court of 
                                              Ghana found it possible to say 
                                              that those who contended that 
                                              presidential declarations were 
                                              justiciable and enforceable were 
                                              basing their contention on a 
                                              misconception of the “intent, 
                                              purpose and effect” of the article 
                                              which, they held, contained 
                                              nothing more than was contained 
                                              and conceived in the Coronation

                                              The reasoning of the court in Re

                                              to be unsound but it has been 
                                              followed in a number of other 
                                              decisions of our courts in which a 
                                              similar stand has been taken by

                                              that the primary concern of the 
                                              law is with the behaviour of human 
                                              beings in society and the

                                              that India had a feudal land

                                              practically created a status of

                                              land and prevented them from 
                                              owning any land. One of the main

                                              Congress was to reform this land 
                                              tenure so as to redistribute land

                                              under the Constitution and so also 
                                              was the denial to these persons of 
                                              a speedy trial. The court adopted 
                                              the strategy of keeping the case 
                                              in view before it and of giving

                                              challenged in court, a bench of 
                                              five judges unanimously held that 
                                              the same benefits should be given 
                                              to the pre-April 1979 pensioners

                                              April 1979 was discriminatory and 
                                              arbitrary and violated the 
                                              equality clause of the Indian 
                                              Constitution. The equality clause 
                                              of the Indian Constitution is 
                                              contained in article 14 while the 
                                              corresponding clause in our 
                                              Constitution, 1992 is contained in 
                                              article 17. The state resisted the 
                                              action on the ground that the 
                                              court had no power to direct 
                                              affirmative action against the 
                                              government which would mean an 
                                              additional financial burden of 
                                              several hundred million rupees and 
                                              said that if the court desired, it 
                                              could strike down or negative the 
                                              pension benefits for all 
                                              pensioners. The court, however, 
                                              rejected this contention and 
                                              ordered the state to pay to the 
                                              pre-April 1979 pensioners the same 
                                              benefits as the pensioners who 
                                              retired after 1 April 1979. The 
                                              court did not shrink from the 
                                              political implications of their 
                                              decision, nor were they overawed 
                                              by such implications.</span></p>

                                              labourers in India. These

                                              fully realise the enormity of the 
                                              powers that they possess under the

                                              upon how they conceive of their 
                                              duties but I have no doubt that 
                                              the makers of our Constitution 
                                              have clothed them with sufficient 
                                              authority. Let them now act.</span></p>

                                              We may end this lecture by making 
                                              a few concluding remarks. The 
                                              1990s may well be classified as 
                                              the decade of human rights. This 
                                              decade has ushered in such a 
                                              commitment to and a concern for 
                                              human rights by the international 
                                              community that no longer are they 
                                              willing and prepared to look on 
                                              hopelessly while governments 
                                              especially in third world 
                                              countries oppress their citizens 
                                              under various pretexts while they 
                                              at the same time extend financial 
                                              and other aid to the governments 
                                              concerned, which aid is often 
                                              misapplied and misappropriated. 
                                              This is a decade of aid 
                                              conditionalities which is a 
                                              welcome departure from several 
                                              decades of indifference justified 
                                              by an invocation of the retrograde 
                                              principle of non-interference in 
                                              the internal affairs of sovereign 
                                              states.</span></p>

                                              This new change in aid-giving 
                                              policy has resulted in no small 
                                              way in the introduction of 
                                              multi-party democracy in a number 
                                              of countries and it is hoped that 
                                              this change will gather sufficient 
                                              momentum to lead to the 
                                              dethronement of all oppressive 
                                              regimes in the world. Autocratic 
                                              regimes complain against what they 
                                              describe as the imposition of 
                                              alien standards and cultures on 
                                              them under the guise of 
                                              conditionalities. The response is 
                                              that the international community 
                                              and the western world do not owe 
                                              the third world countries a living 
                                              and they are entitled, therefore, 
                                              as a condition for the extension 
                                              of the largesse to insist that 
                                              governments who will ask for and 
                                              receive aid should ensure that 
                                              fundamental human rights are 
                                              observed in their countries. This 
                                              is only fair because aid must 
                                              ultimately be for the benefit of 
                                              the masses of the people and it 
                                              would have no significance for 
                                              these masses if they were left to 
                                              languish under the iron heels of 
                                              oppressors and dictators. Such 
                                              regimes have a clear choice: 
                                              either to accept the 
                                              conditionalities along with the 
                                              largesse or to reject them and be 
                                              denied any aid.</span></p>
