                                              The Insurance Law, 19891 regulates 
                                              the insurance industry in Ghana. 
                                              The Law establishes the National 
                                              Insurance Commission and sets out, 
                                              very comprehensively, a code of 
                                              conduct for those engaged in the 
                                              insurance business. However, in 
                                              its attempt to regulate the 
                                              insurance industry in Ghana PNDCL 
                                              227 has made some far-reaching 
                                              changes in some aspects of the 
                                              common law insurance in Ghana. It 
                                              is not the intention of the 
                                              learned writer to touch, in this 
                                              brief article, on the regulation 
                                              of the industry in Ghana. The 
                                              learned writer will only attempt 
                                              to comment on some aspects of the 
                                              common law of insurance in Ghana 
                                              which have been changed by PNDCL 
                                              227.</span></p>

                                              It cannot be gainsaid that common 
                                              law principles of insurance as 
                                              applied in Ghana have, at times, 
                                              produced results considered 
                                              difficult for insured who are 
                                              prevented from recovering losses 
                                              on account of conduct falling 
                                              short of applicable principles. 
                                              Some academics have in fact 
                                              questioned the justification for 
                                              the continued application of 
                                              English common law principles to 
                                              domestic claims given the 
                                              differing socio-economic 
                                              circumstances; and have made calls 
                                              for reforms of those aspects 
                                              perceived as inimical to the 
                                              interests of the insuring public. 
                                              However, the question which must 
                                              be posed here is whether the 
                                              reforms effected in the common law 
                                              of insurance by PNDCL 227 achieve 
                                              this objective.</span></p>

                                              the true facts by the agent could 
                                              not be imputed to the insurance 
                                              company; and consequently that the 
                                              company was entitled to repudiate 
                                              liability on the ground of untrue 
                                              statements in the proposal form. 
                                              This case, in spite of the high 
                                              level of illiteracy in Ghana, was 
                                              with the greatest respect followed 
                                              by the Court of Appeal in Guardian

                                              English authorities on this 
                                              particular point: Bawden v London, 
                                              Edinburgh and Glasgow Assurance 
                                              Co4 and the Newsholme Brothers 
                                              case. The Court of Appeal could 
                                              have tapped a new stream of 
                                              authority by following the Bawden 
                                              case. However, the court, in its 
                                              wisdom, did follow the Newsholme 
                                              Brothers case and denied the 
                                              insured the opportunity to claim 
                                              under the policy. The position of 
                                              the law, to put it mildly, was 
                                              most unsatisfactory and not in the 
                                              best interest of the assured.</span></p>

                                              made against the decision by some 
                                              academics, the position of the law 
                                              remained unchanged until the 
                                              promulgation of PNDCL 227. And 
                                              with the promulgation of that Law, 
                                              the Khayat case must now be cast

                                              for wrongly decided cases. There

                                              and will be no small crumb of 
                                              comfort to the uninitiated whose

                                              confronted the Nigerian courts in 
                                              the case of Northern Assurance v

                                              signature, claimed disclosure of 
                                              certain facts to an agent of the 
                                              insurer who advised the insured's 
                                              clerk to omit those facts in the 
                                              proposal. The insurers repudiated 
                                              liability on the cover note issued 
                                              by the agent alleging

                                              disclosed to the agent, relied on 
                                              the case of Bawden v London,

                                              to hold the insurer bound by the 
                                              knowledge of its agent. The 
                                              Supreme Court, distinguishing the 
                                              Bawden case from, and relying on 
                                              Newsholme Brothers v Road 
                                              Transport and General Insurance Co 
                                              as though the facts fell on all 
                                              fours with the case, held on 
                                              appeal that in completing the 
                                              proposal, the agent acted as the 
                                              agent of the insured only, and 
                                              that knowledge of the truth could 
                                              not be imputed to the insurer. 
                                              This was so though, unlike in the 
                                              [p.265] Newsholme Brothers case, 
                                              the agent had authority to issue 
                                              cover notes on behalf of the 
                                              insurer. Paradoxically, the court 
                                              held that the insured's illiteracy 
                                              was not a ground for departing 
                                              from the Newsholme Brothers 
                                              principle. As already indicated, 
                                              the change of the common law 
                                              position will be hailed by those 
                                              who have to complete proposal 
                                              forms. Any misrepresentation or 
                                              non-disclosure of material facts 
                                              by the insurance agent will not be 
                                              deemed to be that of the assured.</span></p>

                                              duty of disclosure is on the 
                                              insurer as much as the insured. It 
                                              is therefore totally unacceptable 
                                              to assume, as it is assumed in 
                                              section 57 (1) and (2) of the Law, 
                                              that the duty rests only with the 
                                              assured. This Law was made on 19 
                                              September 1989 and the date of the 
                                              Gazette notification was 29 
                                              December 1989. It is pertinent to 
                                              observe that if the makers of the 
                                              Law had been abreast with the 
                                              latest developments in the law of 
                                              insurance, they would have come 
                                              across the case of Banque Keyser

                                              Co.8 This case, succinctly, 
                                              demonstrates that the duty of 
                                              disclosure is on both parties to 
                                              the contract and not only on 
                                              [p.266] the insured.</span></p>

                                              second criticism of section 57(1) 
                                              is that it stipulates that a party 
                                              shall not be under any obligation 
                                              to disclose any fact about which 
                                              no question is asked by the 
                                              insurer or his agent. The point 
                                              which the present writer wishes to 
                                              observe is whether the questions 
                                              are to be asked orally or in 
                                              writing or put on a proposal form? 
                                              This is not even made clear by the 
                                              legislation. What form then are 
                                              the questions to take? Assuming, 
                                              without admitting, that the 
                                              questions are to be asked on a 
                                              proposal form, it must be 
                                              appreciated that whilst proposal 
                                              forms are used in all consumer 
                                              contracts and certain commercial 
                                              risks, they are rarely used in

                                              The question to be asked is

                                              was sought at all in drafting 
                                              section 57(2). It is regrettable

                                              already on the statute books for

                                              end of the day, it will become, to 
                                              the detriment of the assured, a 
                                              fertile source of litigation in 
                                              Ghana; for insurance companies 
                                              with all the ammunition they have, 
                                              will always seek the intervention 
                                              of the courts to determine whether 
                                              the assured should have disclosed 
                                              this or that material fact. Thus, 
                                              a piece of legislation possibly 
                                              designed to assist the assured may 
                                              turn out at the end of the day to 
                                              become a weapon of oppression for

                                              man on the Nima trotro, determine 
                                              whether a particular fact is 
                                              material and should therefore be 
                                              disclosed? The section, in the 
                                              learned writer's opinion, has 
                                              great ramifications for the 
                                              insurance industry. A fact has 
                                              always been considered material 
                                              for the purpose of both 
                                              non-disclosure and 
                                              misrepresentation if it is one 
                                              which would influence the judgment 
                                              of a prudent insurer in deciding 
                                              whether or not to accept the risk 
                                              or what premium to charge. 
                                              Assuming, for the purpose of 
                                              argument, that the learned writer 
                                              wants to take out a hull policy on 
                                              a ship; how can a reasonable 
                                              person determine that a particular 
                                              fact is material and should 
                                              therefore be disclosed? It is not 
                                              a matter which should be left to 
                                              the prudent insurer to determine. 
                                              Will a reasonable person go to 
                                              court to give evidence that a 
                                              particular fact is material and 
                                              should therefore be disclosed? 
                                              Will the courts not rather rely on 
                                              expert evidence from people with 
                                              immense breadth of experience in 
                                              the insurance industry for the 
                                              determination of the materiality 
                                              of a particular matter? The 
                                              learned writer will be watching 
                                              with absorbing interest the sort 
                                              of interpretation the courts in 
                                              Ghana will give to this section 
                                              but it is regretted that the 
                                              section introduces more 
                                              complications into the law.</span></p>

                                              The prudent insurer test is 
                                              formulated in section 18(2) of the 
                                              Marine insurance Act of 1906. Even 
                                              though the Act does not apply to 
                                              Ghana as a statute of general 
                                              application, it was the 
                                              codification of the common law 
                                              applicable to all insurance 
                                              contracts as determined in the 
                                              English Court of Appear in the 
                                              case of Lambert v Co-operative 
                                              Insurance Society.10 The prudent 
                                              insurer test was also adopted by 
                                              the English Court of Appeal in the 
                                              much criticised case of CTI v 
                                              Oceanus Mutual Underwriting 
                                              Association (Bermuda).11 And here 
                                              it is to be added that there was a 
                                              stream of authorities favouring 
                                              the prudent insurer test at the 
                                              time PNDCL 227 was promulgated 
                                              which makes it difficult to fathom 
                                              why a reasonable person test was 
                                              adopted as the test for 
                                              materiality against the weight of 
                                              all the authorities, including the 
                                              decision of the English Court of 
                                              Appeal in CTI International Inc v 
                                              Oceanus. Was the reasonable person 
                                              test adopted just to depart from 
                                              the well-tested common law 
                                              position? As has been pointed out

                                              introduces complications into the 
                                              law and much will depend on the 
                                              judicial interpretation the courts 
                                              in Ghana will put on the section.</span></p>

                                              Finally, some brief comments on 
                                              section 59 of PNDCL 227. Section 
                                              59 has somewhat altered the common 
                                              law of misrepresentation, but the 
                                              import of the section is far wider 
                                              than that. On a careful reading of 
                                              the section, it will be 
                                              appreciated that it has whittled 
                                              down the so-called &quot;basis of the 
                                              contract clause&quot; which is inserted 
                                              at the foot of proposals 
                                              warranting the accuracy of answers 
                                              supplied to be the basis of the 
                                              contract between the parties and 
                                              signed by the proposed. The effect 
                                              is to convert representations in 
                                              proposals into warranties of 
                                              existing or future facts entitling 
                                              the insurer to avoid the policy on 
                                              account of inaccuracy without 
                                              reference to the materiality of 
                                              information obtained or the 
                                              honesty or care with which it was 
                                              given. No doubt, this provision 
                                              will be most welcome by the 
                                              insureds.</span></p>

                                              The section also in a way does 
                                              whittle down the effect of 
                                              warranties and conditions. 
                                              Perhaps, the most common reason 
                                              why insureds in Ghana are denied 
                                              indemnity upon loss is on account 
                                              of breach of policy terms 
                                              described as warranties or 
                                              conditions, even though such 
                                              warranties or conditions may not 
                                              be material to the risk. The wide 
                                              import of the section 
                                              notwithstanding anything contained 
                                              in any contract of insurance 
                                              presupposes that even if it is 
                                              material to the risk, the insurer 
                                              cannot repudiate or avoid the 
                                              policy on that ground. (The 
                                              writer's emphasis.) What is 
                                              difficult to appreciate is why the 
                                              Law does not explicitly dwell on 
                                              conditions and warranties in 
                                              insurance law in general. The 
                                              approach adopted by PNDCL 227 in 
                                              dealing with these two areas which 
                                              have long plagued most common law

                                              the law on warranties and

                                              reforms have been made to the 
                                              common law of insurance in Ghana 
                                              under section 52 of the Law and 
                                              this is most welcome. For reasons 
                                              already addressed, section 59 is 
                                              also most welcome but it is 
                                              regrettable that sections 57(1) 
                                              and (2) and 58 of the Law have 
                                              introduced more complications into 
                                              the law of insurance in Ghana. The 
                                              courts will be faced with the 
                                              delicate task of interpreting the 
                                              two sections. Perhaps, it is still 
                                              too early to speculate on the 
                                              success of these sections as much 
                                              will depend on judicial 
                                              interpretation of the provisions 
                                              and the attitude towards insurance 
                                              litigation likely to surround 
                                              them. However, there is a certain 
                                              inevitability in the conclusion 
                                              that the provisions raise more 
                                              questions than they answer. Some 
                                              of the provisions reveal a lack of 
                                              understanding of the basic 
                                              principles and in areas such as 
                                              warranties, condi- [p.269] tions 
                                              and the “basis of the contract 
                                              clause”, the reforms should have 
                                              been more far-reaching. </span>
