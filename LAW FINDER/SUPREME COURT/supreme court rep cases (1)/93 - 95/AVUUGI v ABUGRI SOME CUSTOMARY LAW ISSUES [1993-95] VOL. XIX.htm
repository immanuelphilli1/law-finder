                                              Customary law has always been an 
                                              area of the law with which the 
                                              courts seem to be ill at ease. 
                                              Whilst some judges and lawyers are 
                                              intent on modernising the law, 
                                              others are content to apply the 
                                              customary rules as they are.1 
                                              However, for both the conservative 
                                              and modernising schools of thought 
                                              there appears to be one common 
                                              ground, namely the point from 
                                              which one may proceed to modernise 
                                              or preserve customary law. The 
                                              content of a rule must first be 
                                              known before a modernising 
                                              influence can be brought to bear 
                                              upon it. Hence, neither school of 
                                              thought would find defensible any 
                                              attempt at modernisation by a 
                                              judge without first ascertaining 
                                              the rule.</span></p>

                                              Another issue that arises is what 
                                              may be described as the &quot;Akanising&quot; 
                                              approach whereby rules of custom 
                                              are held to exist in non-Akan 
                                              communities merely because Sarbah 
                                              wrote about their existence among 
                                              the Fantis. This attitude which 
                                              has been criticised over a long 
                                              period by scholars2 gives cause 
                                              for concern not only because it 
                                              shows disrespect for the customs 
                                              of the non-Akans but also because 
                                              it creates rules which have never 
                                              been known by the people who are 
                                              supposed to practice them.3</span></p>

                                              It is against this background that 
                                              the decision in Avuugi v Abugri4 
                                              by Essilfie-Bondzie J (as he then 
                                              was) is being examined. This case 
                                              attempts to look at the issues 
                                              raised within the modern Ghanaian 
                                              decision-making context. Although 
                                              it was decided under the old 
                                              Courts Act, 1971,5 it is still 
                                              relevant today because the 
                                              provisions on ascertainment of 
                                              customary law have been re-enacted 
                                              under the new Courts Act, 1993. 6

                                              The facts of Avuugi v Abugri are 
                                              not complex by any standards. The 
                                              plaintiff and the defendant, both 
                                              Kusasi men, hailed from the same 
                                              village — Teshie in the Upper East 
                                              Region. One day in August 1986 the 
                                              plaintiff's wife, Faustina, went 
                                              from Teshie village to the Zebilla 
                                              market. When returning home at 
                                              night later that day, she met the 
                                              defendant on the way. The 
                                              defendant was also on his way to 
                                              the village so they (obviously) 
                                              kept each other company. The 
                                              defendant started making advances 
                                              at Faustina. She offered some 
                                              resistance but her resistance was 
                                              overcome by the defendant. 
                                              Consequently, the defendant had 
                                              sexual intercourse with her. There 
                                              was no firm finding as to whether 
                                              her resistance was overcome by 
                                              force or verbal persuasion. On her 
                                              return home, she reported the 
                                              matter to her husband — the 
                                              plaintiff. He took the matter up 
                                              and as a result, the defendant and 
                                              his elders were informed that in 
                                              accordance with custom they had to 
                                              purify the woman before the 
                                              plaintiff could take her back as

                                              The defendant refused to perform 
                                              the custom. The plaintiff, who was 
                                              thus compelled by custom to either 
                                              divorce the woman or purify her 
                                              and take her back, opted to 
                                              perform the purification ceremony. 
                                              His reason for performing the 
                                              custom of purification himself was 
                                              that he had three children by the 
                                              woman and therefore did not wish 
                                              to see the marriage dissolved. The 
                                              purification ceremony involved the 
                                              provision of two sheep, one cock,

                                              and some pito. These were provided 
                                              at a total cost of ¢20,000. It was

                                              bought for purification, as well 
                                              as general damages for seduction,

                                              the existence of the Kusasi

                                              damages. The defendant had 
                                              contended first, that the sanction 
                                              under Kusasi customary law was the 
                                              performance of purification rites 
                                              by the adulterer and not general

                                              principle, damages in the area of 
                                              seduction are not meant to be

                                              Armed with these two cases, his 
                                              lordship held that the ground of 
                                              appeal challenged the existence of 
                                              Kusasi customary law should fail. 
                                              In the first place, there was an 
                                              indication that the two cases 
                                              cited above had anything to do 
                                              with Kusasi customary law. 
                                              Therefore, to use the expression 
                                              “our customary law” without 
                                              indicating whose customary law was 
                                              being referred to, is misleading. 
                                              Although the assimilation of a 
                                              rule of customary law by the 
                                              common law of Ghana has been made 
                                              a possibility,9 no steps have as 
                                              yet been taken in this direction

                                              that function. Customary law thus 
                                              remains rules of law which are by 
                                              custom applicable to particular 
                                              communities in Ghana. It should 
                                              therefore make a difference when 
                                              the parties are from an ethnic

                                              by precedent. Secondly, the 
                                              conclusion drawn by Apatu-Plange 
                                              Ag J in Asante v Wiredu was not 
                                              unassailable. Even though his

                                              that conclusion, it would have 
                                              been helpful if the basis of the 
                                              agreement had been indicated.</span></p>

                                              In Avuugi v Abugri, both parties 
                                              were Kusasi men hailing from the 
                                              same village. The parties had at 
                                              all material times indicated that 
                                              they were operating under Kusasi 
                                              customary law. Both the trial 
                                              court and appellate court made no 
                                              secret of the fact that they were 
                                              attempting to apply Kusasi 
                                              customary law. In such a 
                                              situation, therefore, it would 
                                              seem that it was the content of 
                                              the Kusasi customary law that was 
                                              the real point at issue. The 
                                              treatment of that issue was 
                                              therefore less than adequate, 
                                              seeing that that was the crux of 
                                              the case.</span></p>

                                              The holding in Avuugi v Abugri 
                                              brings into sharp focus issues 
                                              relating to the choice of law and 
                                              ascertainment of the content of 
                                              customary law rules. Having come 
                                              to the conclusion that Kusasi 
                                              customary law was the applicable 
                                              law, the question then was what 
                                              the rights of the parties were. 
                                              This then led to the issue of the 
                                              ascertainment of the content of a 
                                              rule of customary raw. The court 
                                              neatly side-stepped it by relying 
                                              on judicial precedents in coming 
                                              to its conclusions although none 
                                              of the precedents addressed Kusasi 
                                              customary law per se. The issue 
                                              here then is, when may a court 
                                              ascertain the content of a rule as 
                                              prescribed by the Courts Act?</span></p>

                                              were not expressly relied on by 
                                              Essilfie-Bondzie J (as he then 
                                              was), the attitude adopted in 
                                              Avuugi v Abugri appears to 
                                              misrepresent those expressed 
                                              sentiments. It is submitted that 
                                              those cases do not suggest that 
                                              there is no need to ascertain the 
                                              content of customary rules, but 
                                              that those rules, when 
                                              ascertained, are not sacrosanct. 
                                              Therefore if a judge finds a rule 
                                              of custom unreasonable, he could 
                                              refine it notwithstanding the fact 
                                              that the practice would continue 
                                              to be different. This attitude,

                                              From these provisions, the learned 
                                              judge concludes that there is no 
                                              obligation to hold an inquiry. He 
                                              says: &quot;It is clear from the 
                                              language of section 50 ... that it 
                                              is only in the circumstances in 
                                              which a court finds itself under 
                                              situations covered by subsection 
                                              (2) . . . that any consideration 
                                              of resorting to an expert opinion 
                                              becomes necessary . . .&quot;17 
                                              Certainly the conditional tense 
                                              used there indicated that in the 
                                              absence of that condition, there 
                                              would be no obligation. The 
                                              learned judge rightly pointed out 
                                              the prescribed condition under the 
                                              provisions — the issue of the 
                                              existence of doubt in the court's 
                                              mind. However, this was done in 
                                              such a manner as to be liable to 
                                              the misinterpretation that there 
                                              is no obligation to hold an 
                                              inquiry even if by objective 
                                              standards there is a need to do 
                                              so. For, stating that the 
                                              obligation arises only upon a 
                                              stated condition is not the same 
                                              as stating that there is no 
                                              obligation whatsoever.</span></p>

                                              Whilst it is true that the rule 
                                              prescribes a certain condition 
                                              which appears to be a subjective 
                                              standard, it would seem that the 
                                              circumstances under which that 
                                              condition would be regarded as 
                                              having been met are themselves 
                                              deserving of some consideration. 
                                              This is because it is not 
                                              inconceivable that a judge who 
                                              ought to consider himself in doubt 
                                              would nevertheless declare himself 
                                              not in doubt. The question then is 
                                              whether the issue of &quot;doubt&quot; is to 
                                              be determined by a subjective or 
                                              objective standard.18</span></p>

                                              that the court must consider 
                                              submissions by the parties and

                                              would seem therefore that the 
                                              issue of &quot;doubt&quot; ought to be an 
                                              objective one [p.258] as well. If, 
                                              for instance, the court, having 
                                              received contradictory evidence on 
                                              either side, declares itself not 
                                              to be in doubt in circumstances in 
                                              which the basis for rejecting one 
                                              version of the evidence as opposed 
                                              to the other is not clear, surely, 
                                              the issue could not be closed 
                                              merely because that particular 
                                              court did not regard itself as 
                                              being in doubt. Another possible 
                                              scenario is where the court has 
                                              cosidered sources which are 
                                              inappropriate. It is submitted 
                                              that in both situations it would 
                                              be proper to apply an objective 
                                              standard and to hold that the 
                                              court remained in doubt because 
                                              the &quot;sources&quot; considered were 
                                              inappropriate ones.</span></p>

                                              Once that conclusion is arrived 
                                              at, it would be difficult to 
                                              maintain the position that the 
                                              holding of an inquiry is an 
                                              optional affair dependent on a 
                                              particular judge’s discretion. It 
                                              would seem therefore that although 
                                              there is no obligation to hold an 
                                              inquiry if the court entertains no 
                                              doubt the same cannot be said of 
                                              other situations.</span></p>

                                              In Abangana v Akologo, however, 
                                              the issue was not one of doubt as 
                                              to the content, but rather as to 
                                              whether the rule of customary law 
                                              ought to be applied in the form it 
                                              stood. It can therefore not be 
                                              portrayed as an example of how 
                                              judges who consider themselves to 
                                              be in doubt, ought to proceed. 
                                              There was ample evidence before 
                                              the court as to what the Frafra 
                                              customary law rule. To require a 
                                              judge who has ample evidence of 
                                              what the rule is to hold an 
                                              inquiry would be an exercise in 
                                              superfluity. This is a different 
                                              problem from a consideration of 
                                              whether there is need to 
                                              modernise. Edward Wiredu J (as he 
                                              then was) was therefore right in 
                                              declaring himself not bound to 
                                              hold an inquiry.</span></p>

                                              The confusion of the two issues is 
                                              also made manifest in Edward 
                                              Wiredu J’s criticism of Taylor J 
                                              (as he then was). With the 
                                              greatest respect, however, the 
                                              criticism of the mode adopted by 
                                              Taylor J (as he then was) in Billa 
                                              v Salifu19 was unfair, though the 
                                              same may not be said for his 
                                              refusal to modernise the rule. It 
                                              is one thing to invite expert 
                                              opinion on an issue in which the 
                                              court is in doubt, and quite 
                                              another thing altogether to apply 
                                              the outcome of the inquiry. It is 
                                              unclear whether Edward Wiredu J 
                                              (as he then was) was criticising 
                                              the resort to expert opinion or 
                                              the application of the rules so 
                                              declared. Clearly, Taylor J (as he 
                                              then was) was in doubt and did the 
                                              best under the circumstances. His 
                                              refusal to “modernise” should 
                                              therefore be seen as a separate 
                                              issue from whether or not his 
                                              decision to hold the inquiry was 
                                              justified. It was only after he 
                                              had held the inquiry that, on the 
                                              facts as reported, he found 
                                              himself on the same footing as 
                                              Edward Wiredu J (as he then was) 
                                              in Abangana v Akologo. Our judges 
                                              must be encouraged to set the 
                                              [p.259] records straight on the 
                                              content of customary rules even if 
                                              they later refuse to apply them on 
                                              grounds of &quot;modernisation.&quot; It 
                                              would also make it easier to 
                                              attack the basis of the claims to 
                                              modernisation because one would 
                                              know the take-off point.</span></p>

                                              in customary law for seduction is 
                                              for the dishonour and disgrace

                                              Avuugi v Abugri also raises the 
                                              interesting issue of whether the 
                                              action for seduction is outdated. 
                                              Here, there is some ambivalence 
                                              that is worthy of note. Edward 
                                              Wiredu J (as he then was) in 
                                              Abangana v Akologo criticises the 
                                              opinion of Taylor J (as he then 
                                              was) in Billa v Salifu for 
                                              applying an outdated rule. The 
                                              issue of whether a man whose 
                                              customary law did not permit him 
                                              to receive damages for seduction 
                                              was entitled to an award was in

                                              resolved. He was of the opinion 
                                              that a man “ . . . whose legal 
                                              right to the privacy of his wife 
                                              had been invaded,&quot; was entitled to 
                                              damages although the system under 
                                              which he was suing viewed the act 
                                              as a crime or at least 
                                              quasi-criminal. (The writer's 
                                              emphasis.) His lordship in the 
                                              next breath criticised Osei-Hwere 
                                              J (as he then was) for holding in 
                                              Badu v Boakye26 that a certain 
                                              Akan custom was not unreasonable. 
                                              The basis of his criticism was 
                                              that it “ . . . has the effect of 
                                              throwing women back into the slave 
                                              trade days.&quot; With due respect, no 
                                              cause of action smacks more of the 
                                              &quot;slave trade days&quot; than the action 
                                              for seduction. If the court is 
                                              minded to introduce modern ideas 
                                              into the customary law, then one 
                                              useful area would be to undermine 
                                              the customary law notion of women 
                                              as a species of the husband's 
                                              property. In a modern era where 
                                              many women are breadwinners and 
                                              many are well-educated, it seems 
                                              odd that women should continue to 
                                              be seen as pliable objects who are 
                                              made to bend one way or the other 
                                              by voracious males. If modern 
                                              life-styles are different from 
                                              traditional areas, so ought to be 
                                              the rules based upon them.</span></p>

                                              Thus in the mid-1970s when this 
                                              statement was uttered, it was 
                                              already anachronistic. It may have 
                                              served the ends of traditional 
                                              society to credit women with 
                                              wisdom and strength of mind for 
                                              some purposes such as chieftaincy 
                                              matters, and with a puerile and 
                                              pliant mind for others. In this

                                              no basis for keeping up that 
                                              fiction that in matters carnal, 
                                              married women are always led

                                              would a court react if evidence 
                                              showed that far from being the

                                              to be awarded not according to the 
                                              depth of the defendant's pocket 
                                              but according to customary law 
                                              rules. Having no customary law 
                                              rules to rely upon, however, did 
                                              not deter his lordship. Instead, 
                                              he chose the rather dubious ground 
                                              of the plaintiff's status as an 
                                              educated man in that village. He 
                                              said &quot;. . . the plaintiff being 
                                              one of the few educated people in 
                                              the village, adultery committed by 
                                              his wife with another citizen of 
                                              the same village is bound to 
                                              affect his honour and pride . . .&quot; 
                                              Of all the dangerous suggestions, 
                                              one would like to believe that his 
                                              lordship was not suggesting that 
                                              the more educated men there are in 
                                              one's village the smaller is the 
                                              worth of one's honour and pride; 
                                              or conversely that uneducated men 
                                              have no honour and pride. Even if 
                                              his lordship was not minded to 
                                              reduce the damages, the basis upon 
                                              which he refused to tamper with 
                                              the decision of the trial court is 
                                              with respect, completely 
                                              untenable.</span></p>

                                              In the colonial and early 
                                              post-independence days when there 
                                              were very few educated people, 
                                              some amount of education however 
                                              low, was a status symbol. This is 
                                              not exactly true of this country 
                                              now. Again, in a country where 
                                              feverish efforts are being made to 
                                              integrate illiterates into the 
                                              political system, it does seem a 
                                              little unfortunate that fresh 
                                              areas of privilege are being 
                                              created for the educated. If 
                                              indeed damages for seduction is 
                                              known to Kusasi customary law, 
                                              there must be a basis for 
                                              calculating what is due. This 
                                              basis would definitely exclude the 
                                              educational status of the 
                                              plaintiff. It is a fact that 
                                              education in some parts of the 
                                              country is of such recent origin 
                                              that any rule which purports to be 
                                              a customary law rule would be 
                                              suspect if it gave recognition to 
                                              a person's educational status. 
                                              Western education has ceased to be 
                                              the sole measure of a person's 
                                              worth in this country and must not

                                              The decision in Avuugi v Abugri

                                              in which authorities on Akan 
                                              customary law were applied [p.262]

                                              practice of grafting new ideas 
                                              onto old and often outdated

                                              almost certainly no grounding in 
                                              customary law, modern or ancient.</span></p>

                                              If customary law is to be 
                                              modernised, then it is not enough 
                                              to modernise the principle if the

                                              the &quot;slave trade days.&quot; 
                                              Modernisation must start from the

                                              for there is no indication that 
                                              the customary rules of Akans on 
                                              particular issues are necessarily 
                                              the most efficient ways of dealing 
                                              with those issues. If others see

                                              the court came to the conclusion 
                                              that by Dagomba customary law, the 
                                              remedy was not an action for 
                                              damages, but operated more like a 
                                              fine. The researches conducted by 
                                              the learned judge in that case

                                              26. [1975] 1 GLR 283. The issue 
                                              was whether a woman living under 
                                              the Akotoagyan custom was entitled 
                                              to sue for maintenance or breach 
                                              of promise to marry. The court 
                                              held that she could not because 
                                              the custom amounted to an official 
                                              declaration of the state of 
                                              concubinage only and did not 
                                              create a legal relationship from 
                                              which a promise to marry could be 
                                              construed. Akotoagyan meant &quot;drink 
                                              taken for nothing&quot; and amounted to 
                                              nothing upon which an action could 
                                              be founded.</span></p>
