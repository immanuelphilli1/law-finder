                                              The Abiriw-Kyerepong case of

                                              with respect, emphasises the 
                                              paramount need for the inclusion 
                                              of compulsory sociological studies

                                              of his issue including the 
                                              plaintiff, the court surprisingly 
                                              denied relief to other surviving

                                              disclaimed any interest in their 
                                              late father's property. But the 
                                              question is whether their 
                                              disclaimer should have been the 
                                              criterion for deciding whether by

                                              yardstick or norm upon which the 
                                              plaintiff's share had been 
                                              declared; that is to say whether 
                                              by lbo customary law children are 
                                              entitled to their deceased 
                                              father's estate either per stirpes 
                                              or per matres. Unfortunately, the 
                                              court's decision did not reflect 
                                              any advertence upon the question 
                                              of method of distribution whether
