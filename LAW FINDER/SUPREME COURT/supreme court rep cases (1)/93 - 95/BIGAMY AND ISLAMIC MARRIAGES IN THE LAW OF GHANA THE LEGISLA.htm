                                              sweeping principle. One such 
                                              policy is that in order to find

                                              first one was valid. Such a policy 
                                              seems to be a fundamental

                                              observed that, generally, standing

                                              marriages, initially from the

                                              one point in time. It can 
                                              consequently co-exist with 
                                              monogamy only if each system of 
                                              marriage is exclusively confined 
                                              within its own policy sphere. And 
                                              it is precisely at this point that 
                                              Ghana law diverges from the law in 
                                              England in a significant respect. 
                                              This in Ghana H commits also 
                                              bigamy if, while still married 
                                              monogamously to W1, he contracts 
                                              another marriage by native law or 
                                              under [p.72] customary law, that 
                                              is a polygamous marriage, with 
                                              W2.11 The reverse combination also 
                                              constitutes bigamy.12&nbsp; It has been 
                                              held in England, however, that a 
                                              polygamous marriage is not such a 
                                              sufficient first or second 
                                              marriage as would support a charge 
                                              of bigamy.13 To a large extent, 
                                              Ghanaian law rejects this posture 
                                              and seems to have resolutely taken 
                                              the stand that once the second 
                                              marriage is void on the basis of 
                                              the validity of the first one the 
                                              accused has committed bigamy.14</span></p>

                                              The law of bigamy in Ghana has 
                                              remained undeveloped. This has not 
                                              been due to the absence of 
                                              statutory provisions touching the 
                                              offence but to a web of complex 
                                              factors. First, the statutory 
                                              provisions are not without doubt 
                                              as to the kind of polygamous 
                                              marriage which in combination with 
                                              a monogamous one would amount to 
                                              bigamy. The provision refer merely 
                                              to marriages contracted under 
                                              customary law and therefore leave 
                                              doubts as to the role or 
                                              involvement of Islamic or Muslim 
                                              marriages in the bigamy equation.</span></p>

                                              Secondly, there is an almost 
                                              complete absence of prosecutions 
                                              for the offence and, therefore, of 
                                              decided cases explaining the 
                                              nuances and ramifications of the 
                                              offence.17 It is not being 
                                              suggested that people should have 
                                              been committing bigamy. The fact 
                                              of the matter, however, is that 
                                              the offence is [p.73] regularly 
                                              committed within the society and 
                                              the statutory provisions have 
                                              remained more honoured in the 
                                              breach than in the observance. 
                                              Many divorce cases in the courts 
                                              are redolent with suggestions of 
                                              bigamy, yet our procedure does not 
                                              encourage the trial judge to call 
                                              for investigation and possible 
                                              prosecution; that is not the issue 
                                              before him. Furthermore, in tune 
                                              with existing social attitudes, 
                                              such problems are better settled 
                                              between the parties with the 
                                              participation of their parents, 
                                              families, church leaders and 
                                              influential persons in the

                                              Thirdly, the indigenous Ghanaian 
                                              society is polygamous; monogamy 
                                              was unknown, though a man may 
                                              marry and cling to only one wife 
                                              throughout his married life. It 
                                              seems clear, then, that in days 
                                              before the intervention and 
                                              eventual introduction of monogamy, 
                                              bigamy was inconceivable as a 
                                              crime. Perhaps it is fair to say 
                                              that bigamy is, in Ghana, an alien 
                                              implant that has survived 
                                              rejection but has become somewhat

                                              Fourthly, prior to the 
                                              introduction of statutory 
                                              provisions on bigamy in Ghana, the 
                                              offence was regulated by the 
                                              common law. Its prescriptions were 
                                              founded on the fundamental factor 
                                              of a monogamous marriage. 
                                              Therefore the intervention of a 
                                              monogamous ceremony of marriage 
                                              was absolutely essential to a 
                                              conviction of bigamy. This 
                                              combination of a monogamous and a 
                                              polygamous marriage to produce a 
                                              hybrid called bigamy seemed very 
                                              strange indeed to local perception 
                                              and few are those who would 
                                              readily agree that the taking of 
                                              several wives constituted an 
                                              offence; the monogamous ceremony 
                                              would thus be looked upon as a 
                                              mere form and not one prohibiting 
                                              the husband from taking other 
                                              women as wives.18</span></p>

                                              marriage, not all polygamous 
                                              marriages are, on current usage, 
                                              customary marriages. On the side 
                                              of polygamous marriages there are 
                                              for example, Hindu marriages of 
                                              certain Hindu sects, Chinese 
                                              marriages and Jewish marriages.19 
                                              Each such marriage may be 
                                              characterised as a customary 
                                              marriage when considered in 
                                              relation to the society or ethnic 
                                              community whose law or custom 
                                              prescribed the procedures by which 
                                              it may be contracted and the 
                                              incidents attached thereto. A 
                                              Hindu marriage would not be 
                                              customary marriage among Chinese 
                                              people, nor would a Jewish 
                                              marriage be a customary marriage 
                                              among Akans. A customary marriage 
                                              is therefore, [p.74] 
                                              fundamentally, a marriage which is 
                                              indigenous to a particular people 
                                              or ethnic community or tribe. Such 
                                              a marriage may therefore be 
                                              polygamous or monogamous. In 
                                              Qureshi v Qureshi,20&nbsp; for example, 
                                              Sir Jocelyn Simon asserted that in 
                                              England &quot;monogamy is the rule.&quot;&nbsp; 
                                              He could as well have said 
                                              monogamy is the &quot;custom.&quot; The term 
                                              &quot;polygyny&quot;, then, refers to a 
                                              characteristic, that is a man or 
                                              woman's capacity to take several 
                                              wives or husbands concurrently or 
                                              one after the other and during the 
                                              subsistence of the earlier 
                                              marriage or marriages. In the 
                                              technical language of sociology, 
                                              the marriage of one man to several 
                                              women is referred to as &quot;polygyny.&quot; 
                                              In general usage, however, the 
                                              practice is referred to as 
                                              &quot;polygamy&quot;. On the African 
                                              continent, the term &quot;customary 
                                              marriage&quot; has been used to refer 
                                              to indigenous and native marriages 
                                              of African tribes and communities 
                                              south of the Sahara.21&nbsp; Hardly is

                                              From the above analysis, Muslim 
                                              marriages are customary marriages 
                                              in certain communities and among 
                                              certain peoples, particularly 
                                              those of Africa north of the 
                                              Sahara and the Arabian peninsula; 
                                              they are not necessarily customary 
                                              in most sub-Saharan communities, 
                                              even where they have almost 
                                              entirely displaced the indigenous 
                                              marriage systems. In many of these 
                                              communities, Muslim marriages were 
                                              introduced either forcibly by 
                                              rulers on an unwilling people or 
                                              by Muslim immigrants and 
                                              superimposed on the existing 
                                              indigenous institution or 
                                              gradually and willingly adopted by 
                                              native members as a necessary and 
                                              compulsory aspect of their new 
                                              religion.22 The point bears 
                                              emphasis that marriage, whether 
                                              monogamous or polygamous is at 
                                              once a legal, religious and social 
                                              institution. For this reason, it 
                                              has an insidious capacity to 
                                              permeate and establish itself in 
                                              any community as an institution of 
                                              the people even if it is practised 
                                              by a minority of them. But this 
                                              permeation may be merely 
                                              superficial and the seeming 
                                              identification of the new practice 
                                              with the indigenous system may 
                                              derive simply from the fact of the 
                                              new system's similarities 
                                              vis-a-vis the native system. In 
                                              this respect, the [p.75] 
                                              polygamous character of a Muslim 
                                              marriage easily presents it as 
                                              unalien and not entirely opposed 
                                              to the native African's conception 
                                              of marriage, that is, polygamy. 
                                              Essentially for these reasons, one 
                                              has to exercise caution in 
                                              determining whether or not the 
                                              Muslim institution of marriage is 
                                              &quot;customary&quot; in any particular 
                                              African community.</span></p>

                                              As a social and religious fact, 
                                              Muslim marriages exist in Ghana 
                                              also; and they are frequently 
                                              contracted by members and sections 
                                              of the community. In terms of the 
                                              criminal law, however, our 
                                              statutes have always specified 
                                              customary marriages or marriages 
                                              contracted under customary law as 
                                              the marriages which in combination 
                                              with monogamous ones may produce 
                                              bigamy.23 Therefore the very 
                                              crucial question arises as to 
                                              whether the term &quot;customary 
                                              marriage&quot; includes a Muslim 
                                              marriage; or, to generalise the 
                                              question, whether customary law in 
                                              Ghana includes Muslim law.</span></p>

                                              Several arguments may be urged in 
                                              favour of the view that customary 
                                              law includes Muslim law and 
                                              therefore the term customary 
                                              marriage includes Muslim marriage. 
                                              First, when native courts were 
                                              established by Ordinance in this 
                                              country, they were enjoined to 
                                              apply &quot;the native customary law 
                                              prevailing within&quot; their

                                              jurisdiction.24 No separate or 
                                              specific mention was made of 
                                              Islamic or Muslim law. And this 
                                              was done in spite of the 
                                              legislator's knowledge that at

                                              Ghana significant sections of some 
                                              of the communities were Muslims 
                                              governed by Muslim law in many 
                                              respects of their daily lives. The 
                                              situation was similar in scattered 
                                              areas in the southern parts, 
                                              particularly Kumasi, Saltpond, 
                                              Swedru, Elimina, Cape Coast and 
                                              Accra.25 It may be argued then 
                                              that the legislator intended the 
                                              term &quot;native customary law&quot; to 
                                              include Muslim law; indeed, he 
                                              expected that Muslim law would, 
                                              under the rubric of native law, be 
                                              applied as the personal law of the 
                                              parties, particularly where both 
                                              were Muslims. A clear provision 
                                              which was manifestly intended to 
                                              take care of this expectation was 
                                              an injunction to the courts to 
                                              apply in all causes and matters 
                                              before them the provisions of any 
                                              law binding between the 
                                              parties.26&nbsp; This statutory fiat 
                                              provided further the escape hatch 
                                              for the application of Muslim law 
                                              under the general heading of 
                                              native customary law. Permission 
                                              was also given to persons to act 
                                              extra-judicially as arbitrators 
                                              &quot;in any dispute [p.76] of a petty

                                              empowered Zongo headmen and Imams 
                                              to settle disputes according to 
                                              Muslim law and it may be argued 
                                              that the legislator intended the 
                                              reference to native customary law 
                                              to include Muslim law.</span></p>

                                              Secondly, in Ghana itself, there 
                                              is, in communities permeated by 
                                              Islamic practices, a rather hazy 
                                              application of the distinction 
                                              between what is native and what is 
                                              Muslim or Islamic. This exists 
                                              particularly in the area of 
                                              marriage and succession. Muslims 
                                              contract their marriages initially 
                                              according to native rites and then 
                                              add the Muslim Sadaki as if it 
                                              were a native custom requirement. 
                                              In such circumstances it is easy 
                                              to conclude that a native marriage 
                                              includes a Muslim marriage. 
                                              Professor Anderson notes that in 
                                              Yendi, among the Dagombas and 
                                              Konkombas, when it comes to 
                                              divorce, &quot;no distinction is made 
                                              by the court as to whether the 
                                              litigants are pagans or muslims; 
                                              no mallam is consulted, and the 
                                              sadaki is apparently treated as 
                                              any other payment.&quot;29 Indeed, it 
                                              is this mixture of ceremonies 
                                              which compels the suggestion by 
                                              Ollennu, Apaloo and Daniels that a 
                                              Muslim marriage which is invalid 
                                              for non-registration should be 
                                              treated as a valid native 
                                              customary marriage.30 The reverse 
                                              of this suggestion is, however, a 
                                              non sequitur and invalid: it does 
                                              not follow that an invalid native 
                                              marriage may qualify as a valid 
                                              Muslim marriage because, as 
                                              demonstrated above, only a Muslim 
                                              marriage may involve a native and 
                                              a Muslim marriage rolled up in a 
                                              Muslim marriage. Thus, while a 
                                              Muslim marriage may include a 
                                              native marriage, a native marriage 
                                              does not and cannot include a 
                                              Muslim marriage. Hence a 
                                              provision, particularly in a 
                                              criminal statute regarding 
                                              customary marriage does not, and 
                                              should not, include a Muslim 
                                              marriage.</span></p>

                                              Some points have already been made

                                              are several other arguments

                                              law includes Muslim law, and that

                                              First of all, Islam is not native 
                                              or indigenous to any community in 
                                              southern Ghana. Even the northern 
                                              communities, though consisting of 
                                              a larger proportion of Muslims 
                                              than in the south are a mixture of 
                                              pagans and Muslims, the Muslims 
                                              being in the minority. They 
                                              consist of either foreign Muslims 
                                              or indigenes who have embraced the 
                                              Muslim religion and practised it 
                                              alongside their traditional and 
                                              native ways of life.33&nbsp; Studies 
                                              have shown that outside religious

                                              rules of intestate succession, 
                                              indigenous Ghanaian Muslims are 
                                              generally governed by their native 
                                              customs.34&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Anderson 
                                              observes that &quot;Islam is in fact 
                                              incomparably weaker in the Gold 
                                              Coast (Ghana) than in Nigeria.&quot;35 
                                              He adds that the prevalent 
                                              impression in the south (of Ghana) 
                                              &quot;that the Northern Territories 
                                              (Northern, Upper East and Upper 
                                              West Regions) are largely Muslim 
                                              is chiefly derived from the fact 
                                              that most northerners seem to 
                                              profess that religion when they 
                                              come south, whereas in their 
                                              native setting the overwhelming 
                                              majority is frankly pagan and the 
                                              Islam of the minority largely 
                                              skin-deep.&quot;36 He makes a final and 
                                              very telling observation: &quot;. . . 
                                              only to a very limited extent can 
                                              this system [Islam] be said to 
                                              have become identified [p.78] 
                                              anywhere in the Gold Coast (Ghana)

                                              Admittedly, Professor Anderson's 
                                              research was conducted in 1954 and 
                                              the results recorded by him may 
                                              not be the same today. The Muslim 
                                              population, for example, has been 
                                              on a steady increase and now 
                                              stands at about 11 per cent of the 
                                              total Ghana population. Even so, 
                                              there is rather a growing greater 
                                              awareness among Muslims of the 
                                              separateness of their marriage 
                                              vis-a-vis native customary 
                                              marriage.</span></p>

                                              Marriage of Mohammedans Ordinance 
                                              without any indication as to what 
                                              effect this repeal is supposed to 
                                              have on the Muslim law of 
                                              succession which had been 
                                              applicable under the said section 
                                              10. Since the object of the Law is 
                                              to provide a single uniform 
                                              pattern of intestate succession 
                                              for all persons domiciled in Ghana 
                                              at death, it is clear that the aim 
                                              should have been to abolish or 
                                              modify all the then existing 
                                              patterns of inheritance. Yet, in 
                                              the result, only the Muslim 
                                              pattern was sought to be 
                                              abolished. Like the Criminal Code, 
                                              PNDCL 111 provides for the 
                                              application of customary law alone 
                                              to certain portions of the 
                                              intestate estate and completely, 
                                              ostrich-like, shuts its eyes to 
                                              the application of Muslim law.</span></p>

                                              The policy of ignoring Muslim law 
                                              is to be seen also in the severe 
                                              limitations that are imposed on 
                                              the recognition of Muslim 
                                              marriages. A Muslim marriage must 
                                              be registered within one week of 
                                              its celebration41 or within a 
                                              reasonable time after one week or 
                                              probably not registrable 
                                              thereafter.42 An unregistered 
                                              muslim marriage remains invalid 
                                              until it is registered.43 In Ex 
                                              parte Ali, Cecilia Koranteng-Addow 
                                              J emphasised this when she opined 
                                              that: &quot;The essence is not the fact 
                                              of the ceremony but the 
                                              registration; that gives the 
                                              marriage validity.&quot;44 An 
                                              unregistered Muslim divorce has no 
                                              effect as a divorce and so a 
                                              registered marriage remains a 
                                              valid marriage until the divorce 
                                              from it is registered.45 An 
                                              unregistered marriage is bereft of 
                                              any claim to the application of 
                                              the Muslim law of succession to 
                                              the intestate properties of the 
                                              deceased party.46 All these 
                                              disabilities were not similarly 
                                              imposed by the colonial 
                                              administrator in predominantly 
                                              Muslim areas or countries. For 
                                              example, in Kenya, the Mohammadan 
                                              Marriage and Divorce Registration 
                                              Ordinance of 1906 (passed only one 
                                              year before the similar Ordinance 
                                              in Ghana) enjoined the compulsory 
                                              registration of all Muslim 
                                              marriages as in Ghana but provides 
                                              that: &quot;Nothing in this Ordinance 
                                              contained shall be construed to (i) 
                                              render invalid, merely by reason 
                                              of its not having been registered, 
                                              any Mohammadan marriage or divorce 
                                              which would otherwise be valid; 
                                              (ii) render valid, by reason of 
                                              its having been registered, any 
                                              Mohammadan marriage or divorce 
                                              which would otherwise be invalid.&quot; 
                                              The same provision is contained in 
                                              section 17 of the Marriage and 
                                              Divorce of Mohammadans Ordinance, 
                                              1906 [p.80] of Uganda. Indeed, all 
                                              over ex-British colonial Africa, 
                                              provisions have been made 
                                              specifically and distinctly 
                                              separating indigenous or pagan or 
                                              native customary marriages from 
                                              Muslim ones. It cannot therefore 
                                              be convincingly argued in the 
                                              teeth of this evidence that the 
                                              term &quot;customary marriage&quot; or 
                                              &quot;marriage under customary law&quot; 
                                              includes &quot;Muslim marriage&quot;.</span></p>

                                              Thirdly, it seems the most 
                                              compelling early argument against 
                                              treating Muslim marriages as 
                                              included in customary marriages is 
                                              the passage and promulgation of 
                                              our Marriage of Mohammedans 
                                              Ordinance, Cap 129. This statute 
                                              was passed in 1907 for the 
                                              southern parts of Ghana, 
                                              introduced into the northern 
                                              regions in 1931 and amended in 
                                              1935. It is still in force. Only 
                                              section 10 of it which deals with 
                                              intestate&nbsp; succession has been 
                                              repealed by section 19(b) of the 
                                              Intestate Succession Law, 1985 (PNDCL 
                                              11I). Thus, the statutory law 
                                              controlling Muslim marriages 
                                              separately and alone has been left 
                                              substantially intact. The recent 
                                              Customary Marriage and Divorce 
                                              (Registration) Law, 1985 (PNDCL 
                                              112) deals exclusively with 
                                              customary marriages. Its enactment 
                                              provides further evidence of and 
                                              accentuates the exclusiveness of 
                                              customary marriages as against 
                                              Muslim ones. There can be no 
                                              clearer evidence that the 
                                              legislatures of this country, at 
                                              least since 1907, have not 
                                              regarded customary marriages as 
                                              including Muslim ones. This 
                                              legislative choice is 
                                              unmistakable. That it has not been 
                                              explicitly articulated anywhere is 
                                              irrelevant.</span></p>

                                              Pursuant to this directive, it may 
                                              be argued that social policy 
                                              considerations compel a reading of 
                                              section 265 to include Muslim 
                                              marriages. Such reading may be 
                                              supported on the ground that both 
                                              customary and Muslim marriages are 
                                              potentially polygamous in 
                                              character and, as a matter of 
                                              policy, the bigamy provisions are 
                                              intended to prohibit a mixture of 
                                              monogamous and polygamous 
                                              marriages by one person at any one 
                                              point in time; in other words, 
                                              Ghana's policy, as broadly appears 
                                              from its provisions on bigamy, is 
                                              that one person should not be 
                                              simultaneously involved in a 
                                              mixture of monogamous and 
                                              polygamous marriages. In terms of 
                                              this policy, the incongruous 
                                              result created by the Privy 
                                              Council's decision whereby Reid 
                                              remained apparently married 
                                              monogamously to one woman and 
                                              simultaneously polygamously 
                                              married to a second would be 
                                              avoided. The present criminal law 
                                              of Ghana would seem, however, to 
                                              permit the Reid incongruity, 
                                              strengthened very much by the 
                                              express silence on the role of 
                                              Muslim law and Muslim marriages.

                                              marriage must be expressly created

                                              validated the marriage on the 
                                              basis of the legal fact that the 
                                              man was domiciled in a country 
                                              which permitted polygamy and under 
                                              whose law he had capacity to take 
                                              several wives. A Muslim possesses 
                                              capacity to marry several women; 
                                              and it is contended that a 
                                              Ghanaian Christian who has 
                                              converted to Islam and become a 
                                              Muslim acquires such capacity. And 
                                              there is nothing in Ghana's 
                                              present general law which 
                                              prohibits him from a valid Muslim 
                                              marriage. If therefore his Muslim 
                                              marriage is valid, then he cannot 
                                              and must not, on principle, be 
                                              convicted of bigamy.</span></p>

                                              It has been suggested in Kwakye v 
                                              Tuba that a Muslim marriage which 
                                              is invalid for non-registration 
                                              should qualify as a valid 
                                              customary marriage.54 Of course 
                                              this must be subject to the 
                                              qualification that the principle 
                                              should apply only to persons 
                                              domiciled in Ghana and identified 
                                              with a particular Ghanaian tribe. 
                                              Our courts have not yet had an 
                                              opportunity to consider the 
                                              desirability of such a principle. 
                                              It is suggested that it should be 
                                              accepted because of the social 
                                              facts: (i) that most of such 
                                              marriages are a combination of 
                                              native and Muslim marriages; and 
                                              (ii) that even if the courts do 
                                              not recognise the marriage as a 
                                              valid one the parties would resort 
                                              to their Muslim elders and headmen 
                                              to settle problems such as those 
                                              of succession consequent upon such 
                                              marriages as if they were valid. 
                                              The decision in Hashmi v Hashmi 
                                              ought, then, to commend itself to 
                                              our sensibilities.</span></p>

                                              Another reason for supporting the 
                                              suggestion in Kwakye v Tuba is the 
                                              desire to avoid bastardizing the 
                                              issue of the marriage. This, it is 
                                              submitted, [p.83] was the 
                                              paramount, though unexpressed, 
                                              concern of the learned judge in 
                                              Hashmi v Hashmi. We are a society 
                                              with a plural system of marriages 
                                              and we should aim at validating 
                                              marriages as in Hashmi. When we do 
                                              this, the Muslim marriage in issue 
                                              in this discussion would not be 
                                              valid or void, and the accused 
                                              would not be guilty of 
                                              bigamy—precisely as it was held in 
                                              the Reid case. The monogamous wife 
                                              may be given a remedy: she may 
                                              present a petition for the 
                                              dissolution of her marriage, 
                                              coupled with an action for damages 
                                              for the husband's breach of a 
                                              fundamental condition that she 
                                              would remain his only wife.</span></p>
