                                              Over 90 percent of world trade is 
                                              seaborne, that is by maritime 
                                              transport. This means of transport 
                                              is facilitated among others by two 
                                              major ingredients, viz (i) an 
                                              infrastructural network; and (ii) 
                                              a regulatory framework. The thesis 
                                              of this paper will deal with one 
                                              aspect of the international 
                                              regulatory framework for the 
                                              movement of goods by sea. The 
                                              first part will examine and bring 
                                              out some of the weakness of the 
                                              international rules for carriage 
                                              of goods by sea commonly referred 
                                              to as the Hague Rules1 while the 
                                              second part will examine the

                                              to redress some of the weakness of 
                                              the Hague Rules.</span></p>

                                              In an attempt to evaluate the 
                                              Hague Rules it is worth recalling 
                                              the genesis of the rules. For many 
                                              years, the English courts 
                                              recognised the carrier's right to 
                                              contract out of his liability as 
                                              part of the doctrine of freedom of 
                                              contract. Invariably, this led to 
                                              a situation where in the words of 
                                              one scholar it appeared that there 
                                              was no other obligation on the 
                                              shipowner than to receive 
                                              freight.3 The shipowner thus 
                                              carried goods free from any risk 
                                              on his part. As might be expected, 
                                              commercial organisations and other 
                                              shippers having suffered as a 
                                              result of the &quot;freedom of 
                                              contract&quot;, began to question the 
                                              right of shipowners to contract 
                                              out of their common law liability. 
                                              So finally in September 1921, at a 
                                              meeting held at the Hague, a code 
                                              of rules known now as the Hague 
                                              Rules were formulated and 
                                              recommended for international 
                                              adoption by the Maritime Law 
                                              Committee of the International Law 
                                              Association. Subsequently, in 
                                              1924, twenty-four maritime nations 
                                              met in Brussels and signed the 
                                              &quot;International Convention for the 
                                              Unification of Certain Rules of 
                                              Law Relating to Bills of Lading&quot; 
                                              which is now commonly referred to 
                                              as the Hague Rules. For the 
                                              purpose of this paper, it is 
                                              important to recall that the Hague 
                                              Rules have been adopted in this 
                                              country and incorporated in the 
                                              Bills of Lading Act, 1961 (Act 
                                              42).</span></p>

                                              during which period those who were

                                              Shah's observations aptly sum up 
                                              the domination and influence of 
                                              the developed countries in the 
                                              carriage of goods by sea. By 1988, 
                                              the world merchant fleet of ships 
                                              over 300grt consisted of 33,735 
                                              vessels with a total of 372.6 
                                              million grt (610.4 million dwt). 
                                              The Organisation for Economic 
                                              Co-operation and Development 
                                              (OECD) countries had a 32 percent 
                                              share; open registries (most of 
                                              them belonging to the developed 
                                              countries) had 35 per cent and the 
                                              developing countries had 20 per 
                                              cent.5 Naturally the rules were 
                                              skewed in the interest of the 
                                              developed maritime countries who 
                                              provided shipping space. The rules 
                                              thus made light the 
                                              responsibilities and liabilities 
                                              of shipowners as against the 
                                              interests of developing maritime 
                                              nations who primarily were users 
                                              of the service. Despite the fact 
                                              that by 1988 developing countries 
                                              had increased their percentage of 
                                              total world tonnage to about 20 
                                              per cent, the developed countries 
                                              still dominate the means of 
                                              carriage.</span></p>

                                              The very recent times have seen 
                                              feverish attempts by developing 
                                              maritime nations to increase their 
                                              merchant marine fleet, but these 
                                              attempts should blind no one as to 
                                              the need to protect the interest 
                                              of developing maritime nations who 
                                              will for ages to come still be 
                                              users of shipping services 
                                              predominantly controlled by the 
                                              developed nations. Thus the Hague 
                                              Rules hitherto introduced to 
                                              curtail the unbridled freedom of 
                                              contract which favoured shipowners, 
                                              had by the turn of the century 
                                              become woefully inadequate in 
                                              protecting the interest of 
                                              shippers. There was therefore the 
                                              need to review the situation which 
                                              had held sway for almost a 
                                              century.</span></p>

                                              The United Nations Conference on 
                                              Trade and Development (UNCTAD), 
                                              which was dominated by the 
                                              developing countries, was seen by 
                                              the developing countries as the 
                                              best forum to call attention to 
                                              the inadequacies of the Hague 
                                              Rules. After a series of 
                                              deliberations the UNCTAD finally, 
                                              in 1978 in Hamburg, came out with 
                                              a set of rules known as the United 
                                              Nations Convention on the Carriage 
                                              of Goods by Sea commonly referred 
                                              to as the Hamburg Rules. The rules 
                                              seek to deal with some of the 
                                              shortcomings of the Hague Rules 
                                              and has been described by Tetley 
                                              as an &quot;extraordinary document.&quot; He 
                                              explains: &quot;extraordinary because 
                                              the Rules show the influence of 
                                              shipowners and shippers, the 
                                              revendications of P &amp; I and cargo 
                                              underwriters, the complaints of 
                                              carrier and shipper nations and 
                                              the aspirations of wealthy and 
                                              emerging nations.&quot;6 Thus the 
                                              Hamburg Rules represent a 
                                              hotch-potch of interests; and 
                                              while none actually predominates, 
                                              it seeks to achieve an [p.203] 
                                              intricate and delicate balance 
                                              between the varied interests. 
                                              There is also no gainsaying the 
                                              fact that the rules by way of 
                                              modification of language used in 
                                              earlier texts (notably the Harter 
                                              Act, Hague Rules and Hague/Visby 
                                              Rules) is now clearer and has done 
                                              away with the great imbalance that 
                                              skewed disproportionately in 
                                              favour of the carrier.</span></p>

                                              Article 1 of the Hague Rules deals 
                                              with the definition of words and 
                                              phrases used in the text of the 
                                              rules. These include &quot;ship&quot;, 
                                              &quot;goods&quot;, &quot;carrier&quot;, &quot;carriage of 
                                              goods&quot;, etc. While these 
                                              definitions may seem clear in 
                                              themselves, they have often times 
                                              posed problems in their practical 
                                              application and would be the 
                                              subject of comment when the rules 
                                              are examined. Article 2 of the 
                                              Hague Rules deals with the various 
                                              forms of risks covered by the 
                                              rules. In brief, the rules cover 
                                              risks relating to the loading, 
                                              handling, storage, carriage, 
                                              custody, care and discharge of the 
                                              goods. Article 3 is one of the 
                                              most important sections of the 
                                              rules which has undoubtedly led to 
                                              so much litigation. Under article

                                              In the case of Re Unus Shipping 
                                              Co7 an action was brought by the 
                                              respondents against the appellants 
                                              as owners of the vessel for 
                                              damages for the loss of her cargo 
                                              of 33,000 bushels of corn shipped 
                                              at Halifax for Quebec. The vessel 
                                              foundered shortly after setting 
                                              sail due to high wind and wave 
                                              action. It was the contention of 
                                              the appellants that the loss was 
                                              by causes beyond the control of 
                                              the appellants by perils of the

                                              from all of which the appellants, 
                                              having exercised due diligence, 
                                              were exempted by&nbsp; the Hague Rules. 
                                              It was the opinion of the Chief 
                                              Justice that the vessel was 
                                              unseaworthy when she began the 
                                              voyage by reason of the inadequacy 
                                              of the precautions taken to 
                                              prevent the corn from shifting, 
                                              that the situation resulted from 
                                              actual fault and neglect by the 
                                              shipowners who did not exercise 
                                              due diligence to make her 
                                              seaworthy. The [p.204] learned 
                                              Chief Justice concluded that there 
                                              was clear inference from the 
                                              evidence that the shifting of the 
                                              cargo was the direct cause of the 
                                              foundering of the ship without 
                                              which she would not have been 
                                              lost; and that it resulted from 
                                              negligent storage which made her 
                                              unseaworthy from the beginning of 
                                              the voyage.&nbsp; Judgment was

                                              systems of pumps valves and

                                              There is no doubt that defining 
                                              seaworthiness is cumbersome and 
                                              added to this is the fact that the 
                                              seaworthiness of a ship is closely 
                                              related to the exercise of due 
                                              diligence to make the ship 
                                              seaworthy. What amounts to due 
                                              diligence on the part of an owner 
                                              or his servants has been a subject 
                                              of contentious litigations. The 
                                              case of Maxine Footwear Co Ltd v 
                                              Canadian Government Merchant 
                                              Marine Ltd9 serves to clarify the 
                                              point. The facts were that after 
                                              the ship had been loaded and was 
                                              about to set sail, it was found 
                                              that some pipes were blocked by 
                                              ice at the point at which they met 
                                              the ship's side. The master 
                                              instructed one of the officers to 
                                              have the pipes thawed out. This 
                                              work was done by means of an 
                                              acetylene torch. There was a cork 
                                              insulation around the pipes. The 
                                              heat of the acetylene torch acting 
                                              on the cork started a fire which 
                                              led to the scuttling of the ship 
                                              and consequently the loss of her 
                                              cargo. It was the contention of 
                                              the cargo owners that the 
                                              shipowner did not exercise due 
                                              diligence to make the ship 
                                              seaworthy.</span></p>

                                              fulfilled merely because the 
                                              shipowner is personally diligent. 
                                              The condition requires that 
                                              diligence shall in fact have been 
                                              exercised by the shipowner or by

                                              overriding obligation. If it is 
                                              not fulfilled and the 
                                              non-fulfilment causes the damage, 
                                              the immunities of article [p.205] 
                                              4 cannot be relied on. In 
                                              explaining the stage or period of 
                                              unseaworthiness, their lordships 
                                              opined that the phrase &quot;before and 
                                              at the beginning of the voyage&quot; 
                                              means the period from at least the 
                                              beginning of the loading until the 
                                              vessel starts on her voyage. It 
                                              was therefore the view of their 
                                              lordships that the obligation to 
                                              exercise due diligence to&nbsp; make 
                                              the ship seaworthy continued over 
                                              the whole period from the 
                                              beginning of the loading until the 
                                              ship sank. It further reasoned 
                                              that there was a failure to 
                                              exercise due diligence during that 
                                              period. As a result, the ship 
                                              became unseaworthy and this 
                                              unseaworthiness caused the damage 
                                              and loss of the cargo and judgment 
                                              was thus entered for the cargo 
                                              owners.</span></p>

                                              Further, in the case of Muncaster 
                                              Castle,10 several cases of tinned 
                                              food were shipped on the 
                                              respondents' vessel at Sydney for 
                                              carriage to London under bills of 
                                              lading subject to the Australian 
                                              Sea Carriage of Goods Act, 1924. 
                                              When the goods were discharged, 
                                              most of&nbsp; the cases were found 
                                              damaged by seawater which had 
                                              entered the hold through defective 
                                              inspection of the covers to storm 
                                              valves. Evidence was led to show 
                                              that the shipowner employed a 
                                              reputable firm of ship repairers 
                                              to carry out the job of fixing and 
                                              inspecting the valves. It was the 
                                              contention of the shipowners that 
                                              by employing competent repairers, 
                                              the burden of due diligence to 
                                              make the vessel seaworthy was 
                                              thereby discharged. One would have 
                                              thought that it was sufficient for 
                                              owners to employ reputable and 
                                              competent repairers for the job. 
                                              The House of Lords however held 
                                              that the respondents had not

                                              that they had exercised due 
                                              diligence to make the vessel

                                              The fact that the Maxine Footwear 
                                              case and the Muncaster Castle case 
                                              held for cargo interest is not 
                                              what is significant here. While 
                                              the Maxine Footwear case went as 
                                              far as to the Privy Council, the 
                                              Muncaster Castle case went as far 
                                              as to the House of Lords. The 
                                              arguments advanced by both parties 
                                              and the fact that after the 
                                              decision in the Muncaster Castle 
                                              case, shipowners sought to have an 
                                              amendment of the rules in Brussels 
                                              in 1967 and 1968 is even more 
                                              significant. It only serves to 
                                              demonstrate the extent to which 
                                              there is varied opinion as to the 
                                              concepts of seaworthiness and due 
                                              diligence. The decision in the 
                                              Muncaster Castle case has been 
                                              widely criticised but again this 
                                              is due to the fact that the 
                                              language used in the rules is not 
                                              apt or precise enough.</span></p>

                                              problems. Sometimes the loss or

                                              Navigation Co,11 a cargo of 
                                              electric cables loaded in the 
                                              defendants' vessel was insured by 
                                              the plaintiffs for a voyage from 
                                              Liverpool to Buenaventura, 
                                              Colombia and was delivered in a 
                                              damaged condition on 12 December 
                                              1954. The plaintiffs indemnified 
                                              the cargo owners who assigned to 
                                              them their rights to sue the 
                                              defendants. The plaintiffs brought 
                                              an action in the Supreme Court of 
                                              New York on 2 November 1955 
                                              against the defendant but it was 
                                              dismissed for lack of 
                                              jurisdiction. The plaintiffs then 
                                              brought their action against the 
                                              defendants on 7 January 1960 in 
                                              the English courts. It was the 
                                              decision of the court that the 
                                              claim was statute-barred under 
                                              article 3, r 6 for the words 
                                              &quot;unless suit is brought within one 
                                              year&quot; meant &quot;unless the suit 
                                              before the court is brought within 
                                              one year.&quot; The fact that the New 
                                              York proceedings were brought 
                                              within one year was immaterial.</span></p>

                                              It is obvious that in most sea 
                                              trades, it is sometimes a 
                                              cumbersome process knowing who to 
                                              proceed against as parties in an 
                                              action, especially in cases where 
                                              there is transshipment. By the 
                                              time all is set to bring the 
                                              action, one year might have 
                                              elapsed. A case may begin in our 
                                              courts within the limitation 
                                              period of one year but if our 
                                              courts decline jurisdiction after 
                                              one year then the shipper would be 
                                              faced with a similar situation as 
                                              in the above case. It may be said 
                                              that the most important effect of 
                                              the rules is that the carrier can 
                                              no longer contract out of what 
                                              were previously regarded as 
                                              minimum responsibilities and 
                                              obligations. Viscount Sumner

                                              gives shipowners a greater degree 
                                              of protection since they can 
                                              include all sorts of exculpatory

                                              There is a dearth of Ghanaian case 
                                              law regarding the carriage of 
                                              goods by sea, particularly the 
                                              interpretation of the Hague Rules 
                                              as they apply under Ghanaian law. 
                                              This view is borne out by an

                                              predicament in which he found 
                                              himself in his attempt to evaluate 
                                              the provisions of the Hague Rules. 
                                              The Hague Rules have been adopted 
                                              in this country and have been 
                                              incorporated in the Bills of 
                                              Lading Act, 1961 (Act 42). Actions 
                                              involving the application of the 
                                              Hague Rules are very rare and

                                              who is confronted with an isolated

                                              In the case of John Holt Shipping

                                              the above statement, the 
                                              respondents ordered for a quantity 
                                              of goods which arrived safely and 
                                              were unloaded and stored in a 
                                              public warehouse at the Takoradi 
                                              Harbour. Their bills of lading 
                                              delayed in arriving and when they 
                                              eventually did, the goods could 
                                              not be found. The Court of Appeal 
                                              held the view that although at 
                                              common law the shipowner's 
                                              liability does not cease on the 
                                              landing of the cargo, the 
                                              appellants were exempted from 
                                              liability by reason of the express 
                                              provisions in the exemptions 
                                              clause contained in the bill of 
                                              lading. It was the contention of 
                                              the court that the Hague Rules do 
                                              in fact acknowledge the right of 
                                              shipowners to contract out in 
                                              matters not connected with the 
                                              duties and obligations imposed by 
                                              the rules. But as made out 
                                              earlier, this affords a shipowner 
                                              who at the same time is a 
                                              custodian of cargo before loading 
                                              or discharge, the opportunity to

                                              board a vessel but before it had 
                                              crossed the ship's rail, it was 
                                              dropped and damaged through the

                                              shipowners claimed that they could

                                              be drawn that the rules are 
                                              applicable before loading and 
                                              consequently after discharge, ie 
                                              going by the decision in the 
                                              Pyrene case.</span></p>

                                              This then brings us back to 
                                              articles 7 and 3, r 8. Indeed, if 
                                              the Hague Rules apply before the 
                                              goods are loaded, then it is 
                                              submitted that the two articles do 
                                              not complement each other but are 
                                              rather contradictory; and if not, 
                                              then article 7 is superfluous when 
                                              considered alongside article 1(e) 
                                              and would thus have been added ex 
                                              abundanti cautela. The truth of it 
                                              is that the rules thereby leave 
                                              lawyers and judges alike, 
                                              confused. In the John Holt case, 
                                              reference was not made to the 
                                              Pyrene case.</span></p>

                                              The Hague Rules also provide for 
                                              an almost unending catalogue of 
                                              excepted perils which once 
                                              established as the cause of loss, 
                                              relieves the carrier from 
                                              liability. Amongst these is the 
                                              infamous article 4. Though case 
                                              law abounds here, its direction 
                                              has never been precise and 
                                              litigation in this area of the law 
                                              can only be described as 
                                              prodigious. Under article 6, r 2 
                                              (a), the carrier and his servants 
                                              are relieved from the consequences 
                                              of error in the navigation or in 
                                              the management of the ship. A bold

                                              In the case of Gosse Millerd 
                                              Ltd,18 a cargo of tinplates was 
                                              shipped in a vessel under a bill 
                                              of lading incorporating the Hague 
                                              Rules . During the voyage, she 
                                              sustained damage and had to put 
                                              into a port of distress; and 
                                              whilst the repairs were being 
                                              executed, the hatches were left 
                                              open so that the workmen could go 
                                              in and out of the hold more 
                                              easily. The hatches were not 
                                              protected when rain was falling 
                                              and the tinplates were found 
                                              damaged on arrival. It was the 
                                              decision of the House of Lords 
                                              that the shipowners were liable. 
                                              Their lordships dismissed the plea 
                                              by the owners that they could 
                                              exempt themselves form liability 
                                              since this was a case of 
                                              negligence in the management of 
                                              the ship. It was the view of the 
                                              court that the term &quot;negligence in 
                                              the management of the ship&quot; did 
                                              not include negligence in the 
                                              management of the hatches. This 
                                              again is the fine line earlier 
                                              referred to. How separate is the

                                              its roots in the shipowner's

                                              a &quot;peril of the sea&quot; has been

                                              practical cases have been shrouded 
                                              in obscurity and uncertainty. 
                                              Generally speaking, the phrase 
                                              &quot;perils of the sea&quot; is said to 
                                              cover damages relating from 
                                              dangers peculiar to maritime 
                                              transport such as impact of waves, 
                                              violent storms, fog etc, something 
                                              which strictly speaking could have 
                                              been controlled if the vessel was 
                                              travelling on land. This exception 
                                              is thus due to the peculiar 
                                              [p.211] hazards of the sea. In the

                                              Herschell, speaking in relation to 
                                              an insurance policy but observing 
                                              that his remarks applied with 
                                              equal force to bills of lading, 
                                              reasoned:</span></p>

                                              'peril of the sea, ' does not 
                                              cover every accident or casualty 
                                              which may happen to the

                                              the sea. Again, it is well settled 
                                              that it is not every loss or 
                                              damage of which the sea is the

                                              While in the earlier cited case an

                                              extraordinary. The law on this is

                                              the judges have inclined to the 
                                              view that the peril must be one 
                                              that would ordinarily not have

                                              packaging modes. Today, packaging 
                                              is done by means of containers, 
                                              pallets and other sophisticated 
                                              modes of cargo movement, while the 
                                              rules were fashioned at a time 
                                              when packaging modes were bales, 
                                              crates, drums, etc. The other is 
                                              the deterioration in value of the 
                                              limits set, due to rising 
                                              inflation.</span></p>

                                              Aleksandr Serafimovich.21 Here the 
                                              plaintiffs shipped 150 cartons of 
                                              sewing machine heads valued at 
                                              $43.05 each from Japan for 
                                              delivery at Vancouver, Canada. The 
                                              cartons were strapped to three 
                                              pallets each containing 50 
                                              cartons. The bills of lading 
                                              included&nbsp; a heading &quot;packages&quot;

                                              court in dealing with whether a 
                                              pallet was a package within the 
                                              meaning of article 4, r 5 reasoned 
                                              that this depended on the facts 
                                              and circumstances of each case and 
                                              in particular on the intention of 
                                              the parties as indicated by what 
                                              was stated in the shipping 
                                              documents; things said by the 
                                              parties and the course of dealings 
                                              between them. The court went 
                                              further to rationalize that in 
                                              determining whether a pallet was a 
                                              package or not, one ought to look 
                                              at the description of the goods on 
                                              the bill of lading, the numbering 
                                              of the cartons and their

                                              pallets. It came to a conclusion 
                                              that having regard to the above, 
                                              the governing factor in the minds 
                                              of the parties was 150 sewing 
                                              machine heads each packed in a 
                                              separate protective carton, rather 
                                              than the pallet in which 50 of 
                                              them were stacked. The defendants 
                                              were thus not entitled to limit 
                                              their liability in that respect. 
                                              The packages in this context were 
                                              150 packages as expressed on the

                                              This serves to illustrate how the 
                                              court can pay heed to the 
                                              contractual terms, taking it to be 
                                              the intention of the parties and 
                                              can limit the liability of the 
                                              shipowner under the rules however 
                                              unfair it may seem. In that case, 
                                              two large boilers belonging to the 
                                              Royden Machinery Co were shipped 
                                              on board the vessel Anders Maersk 
                                              from Baltimore, USA to Shanghai, 
                                              China. While the vessel was on its 
                                              voyage, it encountered heavy 
                                              weather resulting in the loss at 
                                              sea of one of the boilers while 
                                              the other fell on the deck and 
                                              suffered heavy damage. In a claim 
                                              by the Royden Machinery Co for the 
                                              loss it had suffered, the 
                                              shipowners sought to limit their 
                                              liability to a thousand dollars 
                                              having regard to the $500 per 
                                              package limitation under the 
                                              United States Carriage of Goods by 
                                              Sea Act fashioned along the lines 
                                              of the Hague Rules. The court 
                                              upheld their contention. It 
                                              expressed the opinion that it was 
                                              essential to have regard to the 
                                              contractual relations between the 
                                              parties and unless reference was 
                                              made to the contract between the 
                                              parties there would always be a 
                                              likelihood that there would be an 
                                              element of uncertainty. Here, for 
                                              damage to a boiler and loss of 
                                              another, the shipowner was allowed 
                                              to limit his liability to $1,000, 
                                              ie $500 per package. Each boiler 
                                              was regarded as a package for the 
                                              purposes of limitation.</span></p>

                                              quite often do not even see the

                                              clauses in bills of lading which 
                                              has prevented shippers, especially 
                                              from the developing countries, 
                                              from bringing suit or seeking

                                              countries where in fact almost all 
                                              cargo claims arise. Shippers are 
                                              unable to choose a forum because 
                                              shipowners have inserted clauses 
                                              regarding forums in their bills of 
                                              lading. A shipowner almost 
                                              invariably chooses a forum 
                                              convenient to him regardless of 
                                              the destination of the cargo.</span></p>

                                              Hague Rules, the

                                              registered in Ghana and carrying 
                                              on business in Ghana; the 
                                              shipowner was a Ghanaian

                                              English law on the matter did not

                                              proceedings would not be stayed 
                                              for the case to be transferred to 
                                              an English court. This decision 
                                              was given by the learned judge in 
                                              the face of the jurisdiction 
                                              clause which the parties had 
                                              themselves agreed upon as 
                                              contained in the bill of lading. 
                                              It is quite clear from the facts 
                                              of this case that the plaintiffs 
                                              would have suffered manifest 
                                              unjustice if proceedings were 
                                              stayed and the case transferred to

                                              contentious litigation. Despite 
                                              the fact that the interpretation 
                                              of reasonableness is one which 
                                              from time immemorial judges have 
                                              had the duty to pronounce upon, it 
                                              has not been possible to formulate 
                                              a criterion of universal 
                                              applicability and precision, for 
                                              as Lord Macmillan put it in the 
                                              case of Stag Line Ltd v&nbsp; Foscolo 
                                              Mango &amp; Co Ltd:26&nbsp; &quot;...the

                                              are as infinite in their variety 
                                              as the vagaries of the sea 
                                              itself.&quot; He was quick to add that: 
                                              &quot;An undefined standard of 
                                              reasonableness may sometimes be 
                                              difficult to apply...&quot; Thus the 
                                              choice of words in the provision 
                                              has rendered the provision open to 
                                              varied interpretations often to 
                                              the detriment of cargo interests. 
                                              Sometimes deviations to collect 
                                              additional cargo leading to delay 
                                              and consequently loss to the cargo 
                                              owner has been covered under 
                                              reasonable deviation.</span></p>

                                              There was however unreasonable 
                                              deviation in the case of Nabb 
                                              Brothers v The Owners &amp; Parties 
                                              Interested in MV Ocean Prima.27 
                                              The plaintiffs contracted with the 
                                              defendants under a bill of lading 
                                              in which the port of loading was 
                                              stated as Bangkok. The bill of 
                                              lading stated that the vessel was 
                                              to sail from Bangkok to Owendo, 
                                              thence to Tema. The vessel however 
                                              sailed from Bangkok to Singapore, 
                                              called at South Africa, Dakar, 
                                              Abidjan, Owendo before finally 
                                              arriving at Tema. The deviation 
                                              from the agreed route resulted in 
                                              delay and the consignee suffered 
                                              huge losses as a result of the 
                                              delay. It was held by the learned 
                                              judge that the plaintiffs could 
                                              claim for damages arising out of 
                                              the delay. As pointed out earlier, 
                                              the Hague Rules cover situations 
                                              of deviation. It however does not 
                                              cover situations of delay. Whether 
                                              delay arising out of deviation is 
                                              implicity covered under the rules 
                                              is debatable. In the MV Ocean 
                                              Prima case, the learned judge once 
                                              again based his judgment on 
                                              general principles of law and 
                                              public policy considerations. 
                                              Though he made reference to Act 42 
                                              he made no reference to the Act in 
                                              terms of the legal basis upon 
                                              which the terms of the contract 
                                              was established. The issue of 
                                              delay with regards to the 
                                              application of the [p.216] Hague 
                                              Rules was not discussed and it is 
                                              doubtful whether the non-inclusion 
                                              of delay was pleaded as a defence 
                                              to the action.</span></p>

                                              Lord Atkin in the Foscolo Mango28 
                                              case laid down what is supposed to

                                              but again it is neither definite 
                                              nor precise. He was of the view 
                                              that to be reasonable, a deviation 
                                              need not only be made with the 
                                              joint interests of ship and cargo 
                                              or to avoid an imminent peril.

                                              It is submitted that the Hague 
                                              Rules in codifying the common law, 
                                              left us in no better position and

                                              always be put on the provisions 
                                              regarding deviation. Lord Atkin's 
                                              test gives a very wide room for 
                                              manipulation and it is no wonder

                                              question of interpretation and the

                                              However, the practice has not been 
                                              so. All over the world, there are 
                                              a lot of uncertainties arising 
                                              from vague and ambiguous wording 
                                              in certain areas of the Hague 
                                              Rules which lead to conflicting 
                                              interpretations and which 
                                              complicate such matters as to the 
                                              allocation of responsibility for 
                                              loss or damage to cargo. In the 
                                              end, quite commonly, the rules 
                                              have been exploited to evade 
                                              liability rather than to anchor 
                                              responsibility. The shipper has 
                                              been at the losing end of this

                                              of discharge, etc. The rules can 
                                              thus be invoked if goods are 
                                              landed in Ghana, ie as soon as 
                                              Ghana becomes a contracting state, 
                                              irrespective of whether it is 
                                              stated in the bill of lading that 
                                              the Hamburg Rules shall apply. For 
                                              a contracting state therefore, 
                                              claims for damage to cargo can now 
                                              be brought in the state where the 
                                              cargo is discharged. This indeed 
                                              is a useful innovation.</span></p>

                                              These provisions give statutory 
                                              blessing to a wider interpretation 
                                              of Devlin J's decision in the 
                                              Pyrene case.34 The effect of this 
                                              is that, though a bill of lading 
                                              will not have been issued, the 
                                              rules can still be applicable once 
                                              the carrier has taken charge of 
                                              the goods. That is to say where 
                                              the issuance of a bill of lading 
                                              or other transport document is 
                                              contemplated. The Hamburg Rules 
                                              would thus seem to deal 
                                              conveniently with the difficulties 
                                              that confronted our learned judges 
                                              in the John Holt case.35 If it is 
                                              established that the carriers were 
                                              still in charge of the goods while 
                                              they were kept in the public 
                                              warehouse awaiting the arrival of 
                                              bills of lading, then ipso facto 
                                              they were liable by no stretch of 
                                              imagination.</span></p>

                                              The Hamburg Rules also seek to 
                                              reduce the unending catalogue of 
                                              carriers exceptions contained in 
                                              the Hague Rules with a view to 
                                              achieving an equitable balance 
                                              between carrier and cargo 
                                              interest. It needs to be mentioned 
                                              that while the litany of defences 
                                              open to the carrier has been 
                                              greatly whittled down, the defence 
                                              of fire has been retained with a 
                                              slight tilt in favour of the 
                                              carrier. Under article 5(4) (i) 
                                              the burden of proof in the case of 
                                              fire has changed from one of 
                                              actual fault or privity of the 
                                              carrier36 which has been tested 
                                              before the courts, to the new 
                                              concept of presumed fault or 
                                              neglect. One however needs to 
                                              mention that the new provision by 
                                              its wording requires the party 
                                              without the evidence to make the 
                                              proof, but again, as a trade-off 
                                              it is welcome. The nautical faults 
                                              defence which as stated earlier 
                                              was a great worry to cargo owners 
                                              has been eliminated. So that now, 
                                              neither the carrier nor his 
                                              servants or agents could plead 
                                              negligence and be exonerated.</span></p>

                                              Hamburg Rules the carrier is 
                                              entitled to carry cargo on deck 
                                              only if such carriage is in 
                                              accordance with an agreement with 
                                              the shipper or with usage of the 
                                              particular trade or is required by 
                                              statutory rules and regulations. 
                                              Under section (2) of article 9, 
                                              where there is an agreement to 
                                              carry on deck, the carrier is 
                                              enjoined to insert this in the 
                                              bill of lading or the necessary 
                                              [p.220] document covering the 
                                              contact of carriage. There is no 
                                              doubt that the modern concept of&nbsp; 
                                              &quot;containerization&quot; influenced the 
                                              drafters of the Hamburg Rules and 
                                              this has been taken care of in 
                                              article 9. However, the rule is 
                                              not wholly an advantage to the 
                                              cargo owner because whereas under 
                                              the Hague Rules, deck carriage, if 
                                              not stated in the bill of lading 
                                              was a fundamental breach, under 
                                              the Hamburg Rules this does not 
                                              amount to a fundamental breach. 
                                              The breach only makes the carrier 
                                              lose his per package limitation 
                                              and the claimant who has to 
                                              establish this has a heavy burden 
                                              of proof. He needs to show that 
                                              the deck carriage was done, and 
                                              that it was done &quot;with intent to 
                                              cause such loss, damage or delay 
                                              or recklessly and with knowledge 
                                              that such loss, damage or delay 
                                              would probably result.&quot;</span></p>

                                              The Hamburg Rules also make 
                                              meaningful improvements on the 
                                              Hague Rules by dealing with the 
                                              problematic issues of 
                                              jurisdiction, forum and applicable 
                                              law. As mentioned earlier, 
                                              developing countries have been at 
                                              the receiving end in this regard. 
                                              Now the Hamburg Rules state that

                                              institute an action in a court

                                              The above provision is a watershed 
                                              as far as innovations in the 
                                              development of maritime law is 
                                              concerned. It would undoubtedly 
                                              give maritime law a boost in 
                                              developing countries such as ours. 
                                              Once the question of forum is 
                                              solved, that relating to 
                                              jurisdiction and the applicable 
                                              law becomes clear. Article 2(1) 
                                              gives us the position as to what 
                                              law is applicable and now local 
                                              courts based in the place where 
                                              the damage or loss is discovered 
                                              can apply the lex fori after 
                                              assuming jurisdiction. With the 
                                              Hamburg Rules therefore, the 
                                              Ghanaian courts would very often 
                                              assume jurisdiction in damage or 
                                              loss to cargo claims. The law in 
                                              this area will develop and cargo 
                                              interests will generally have a 
                                              better deal.</span></p>

                                              Under the Hamburg Rules, an action 
                                              is statute-barred if judicial

                                              Delay in delivery is not 
                                              specifically spelt out in the 
                                              Hague Rules. The Hamburg Rules 
                                              account for this. Under article 
                                              5(1) the carrier is liable for 
                                              delay in delivery unless he proves 
                                              that he took all reasonable 
                                              measures to avoid the occurrence. 
                                              Again, there is here a shift in 
                                              the burden of proof from privity 
                                              to one of presumed fault or 
                                              neglect. The exception here is 
                                              where the delay was occasioned by 
                                              fire. In that respect, the burden 
                                              of proof shifts unto the 
                                              claimant.41 Again, this is clearer 
                                              than the vague position under the 
                                              Hague Rules where one ought only 
                                              with imaginative conjuration to 
                                              stretch article 3, r 2 to cover 
                                              cases of delay.</span></p>

                                              Deviation has always been a bone 
                                              of contentious litigation. The 
                                              Hamburg Rules whilst it attempts 
                                              to deal with the situation, does 
                                              not stricto sensu leave us any 
                                              better. Article 5 (6) makes the 
                                              carrier liable for loss, damage or 
                                              delay in delivery where these are 
                                              occasioned by measures to save 
                                              property at sea. One can only 
                                              presume that there is a greater 
                                              obligation upon the carrier since 
                                              in cases of saving property at 
                                              sea, he needs to take reasonable 
                                              measures.</span></p>

                                              Another remarkable innovation 
                                              brought in by the Hamburg Rules is 
                                              the inclusion of articles 1(2), 10 
                                              and 15 (1)(c). These articles make 
                                              it clear that the contracting 
                                              carrier is responsible for the 
                                              acts of the actual carrier. The 
                                              claimant does not now need to 
                                              unravel the complicated 
                                              contractual relationship between 
                                              the charterers and vessel owner or 
                                              the contracting carrier and actual 
                                              carrier before taking suit. This 
                                              is indeed a welcome innovation for 
                                              cargo interests.</span></p>

                                              Yet another important departure 
                                              from the Hague Rules is that the 
                                              convention is not limited to 
                                              covering bills of lading.42 This 
                                              is due to the fact that having 
                                              regard to the high level of 
                                              modernisation there is an 
                                              increasing use in certain trades 
                                              of way-bills, other types of 
                                              non-negotiable documents including 
                                              documents processed by means of

                                              As stated earlier in this paper, 
                                              the limitation of the carrier's 
                                              liability pegged at &quot;two hundred 
                                              Ghanaian pounds&quot; under the Bills 
                                              of Lading Act, 1961 (Act 42) has 
                                              long become meaningless. The new 
                                              monetary limits have taken into 
                                              account the common denominator of 
                                              the Special Drawing Rights (SDR). 
                                              Under the Hamburg Rules, the limit 
                                              is now fixed for loss or damage to 
                                              cargo at 835 SDR's per package or 
                                              fixed for loss or damage to cargo 
                                              at 835 SDR's per package or 
                                              shipping unit or 2.5 SDR's per 
                                              kilo whichever is higher.43 The 
                                              position is clearer when one notes 
                                              that if the package or unit weighs 
                                              less than 334 kilograms, the limit 
                                              will be 835 SDR's per unit. If the 
                                              package weighs more than 334 
                                              kilograms, then the limit will be 
                                              2.50 SDR times the gross weight 
                                              (in kilograms) of the goods lost 
                                              or damaged.44</span></p>

                                              Under article 6(2)(a), the 
                                              situation is obviated where under 
                                              the Hague Rules, numerous packages 
                                              loaded into one container would be 
                                              counted only as one package for 
                                              the purposes of limitation as 
                                              happened in the Royden Machinery 
                                              Co case. Even of utmost importance 
                                              in this innovative approach to 
                                              calculating limitation of 
                                              liability is the fact that the 
                                              value of the amount as converted 
                                              in national currency will be the 
                                              same in all contracting states. 
                                              Akin to this is also the fact that 
                                              the new levels reflects the levels 
                                              contained in other transport 
                                              conventions such as the Multimodal 
                                              Transport Convention.45 In cases 
                                              where a consignee brings an action 
                                              for delay in delivery of goods, 
                                              the carrier's liability is limited 
                                              to two and half times the freight 
                                              payable under the contract of 
                                              carriage. This is definitely in 
                                              favour of carriers and while it 
                                              remains repugnant to cargo 
                                              interests, it needs to be seen as 
                                              part of the package deal without 
                                              which the convention would not 
                                              have seen the light of day. </span>

                                              The views held by various judges 
                                              regarding the interpretation of 
                                              the Hague Rules have already been 
                                              discussed. Their view that the 
                                              Hague Rules have an international 
                                              character has now got statutory

                                              Hamburg Rules and contracting 
                                              parties by virtue of this

                                              It is also worthy of note that in 
                                              seeking uniformity, article 31 
                                              instructs contracting parties to 
                                              denounce the Hague Rules since at 
                                              present there are a fairly large 
                                              group of Hague Rules states, Ghana 
                                              included by virtue of Act 42, a 
                                              somewhat smaller group of Hague-Visby 
                                              states and a not insignificant 
                                              group of states which are both 
                                              Hague and Hague-Visby Rules states 
                                              at the same time. To have the 
                                              rules operating pari passu would 
                                              lead to enormous conflicts; hence 
                                              the need to denounce the other 
                                              rules upon acceptance of the 
                                              Hamburg Rules. The Hamburg Rules 
                                              strived to achieve uniformity and 
                                              diffuse the fears of maritime 
                                              interests which saw the shift in 
                                              the burden of proof from privity 
                                              of knowledge to presume fault or 
                                              neglect as one close to strict 
                                              liability. Thus the conference 
                                              after a philological discussion 
                                              included a common understanding in 
                                              the final Act as an aid to

                                              To conclude, it needs to be 
                                              mentioned that the Hague-Visby 
                                              Rules which was supposed to be an 
                                              improvement upon the Hague Rules,

                                              where the delay exceeds 60 days. 
                                              Problems regarding the insertion

                                              that the cargo owner may bring his 
                                              action in one of the countries
