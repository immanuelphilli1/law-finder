                                              The history of mankind has been 
                                              dominated by a struggle for human 
                                              rights in a desperate search for 
                                              justice.&nbsp; It has been a 
                                              progressive erosion and gradual 
                                              repudiation of autocracy or the 
                                              rule of dictators and tyrants in 
                                              favour of democracy under the rule 
                                              of law. History completely 
                                              demonstrates that men and women in 
                                              all societies are able to enjoy 
                                              their inalienable rights as human 
                                              beings when laws rather than the 
                                              arbitrary activities of their 
                                              fellow men direct their affairs.1

                                              function are the public domain and 
                                              the private domain. Within these 
                                              two spheres, the influence of 
                                              British imperialist ideas on our 
                                              entitlement to human rights is to 
                                              identify five conceptual levels at 
                                              which the human rights of 
                                              Ghanaians operate. These levels 
                                              are in ascending order of 
                                              operation: (a) the customary

                                              There are within the general

                                              groups to which distinct rights

                                              descriptively referred to as

                                              hence, the true scope or dynamics 
                                              of the human rights notion is 
                                              concerned with the exercise of 
                                              these rights by men and women in 
                                              the entire world.&nbsp; A logical 
                                              analysis of all forms of human 
                                              rights discloses political rights 
                                              exercisable in the public domain 
                                              and civil rights which operate in 
                                              the private sector of human 
                                              activity. Thus the entire notion 
                                              of human rights consists of 
                                              political and civil rights.&nbsp; 
                                              Having regard to the types of 
                                              activity which human beings by 
                                              nature normally engage in, one can 
                                              also monitor the exercise of human 
                                              rights in terms of the economic, 
                                              social and cultural activities and 
                                              practices of men and women. This 
                                              way of considering human rights 
                                              enables us to divide all rights 
                                              into political and civil rights 
                                              and their [p.85] exercise in the

                                              As I have just pointed out, the

                                              physical strength of the animal 
                                              variety than his normal female 
                                              counterpart. This physical 
                                              strength manifests itself in 
                                              violent effusions and incipient 
                                              actions in all manner of ways. The 
                                              actual use of this strength has 
                                              enabled groups of men throughout 
                                              the tortuous history of mankind to 
                                              dominate their fellow men. Its 
                                              psychological effect as well as 
                                              the threat of its use has cowed 
                                              down the female of the specie in 
                                              almost all countries of the world, 
                                              and inhibited their entitlement of 
                                              human rights on a basis of 
                                              equality with men. This is 
                                              apparently the reason for 
                                              differing human rights norms in 
                                              male and female societies.</span></p>

                                              consideration of the purview of 
                                              these rights as a global notion 
                                              and as a municipal concept. The

                                              requires the focusing of attention 
                                              on the subject matter of human 
                                              rights.&nbsp; Human rights as a notion, 
                                              when thus viewed, are seen as 
                                              primarily and exclusively 
                                              concerned with only one single 
                                              subject matter and that is: the 
                                              &quot;human being.&quot; On further 
                                              consideration it is apparent that 
                                              the idea of human rights can be 
                                              definitively described as the 
                                              activities which human beings, 
                                              both male and female, consider 
                                              themselves to be entitled to 
                                              indulge in without any 
                                              interference whatsoever from any 
                                              authority or their fellow human 
                                              beings. Clearly, therefore, these 
                                              activities or the entitlement to 
                                              be involved in them are claimed by 
                                              men and women on the basic 
                                              justification that they the 
                                              claimants are human beings. There 
                                              is no other rational foundation 
                                              supporting human rights claims. On 
                                              further reflection, it would 
                                              [p.86] seem that the human 
                                              activities of all persons, having 
                                              regard to the norms operating in 
                                              their societies, can be subjected 
                                              to a test as to whether as humans 
                                              in the respective societies, they 
                                              are entitled to engage or be 
                                              involved in such activities or 
                                              not. If they are by the traditions 
                                              and understanding operating in the 
                                              society entitled to be involved in 
                                              such activities, then they have 
                                              passed the test and their 
                                              activities fall within the scope 
                                              of human rights. And under such 
                                              circumstances, there must be an 
                                              obligation reposing in other 
                                              persons or authority to respect 
                                              and protest the exercise of these 
                                              rights. lf however they fail the 
                                              test, then their activities fall 
                                              outside the scope of human rights 
                                              and the claims will be aberrant.</span></p>

                                              Even from this narrow perspective, 
                                              it is apparent that the human 
                                              rights concept is being projected 
                                              on the public sphere. It is in 
                                              effect an effort at mapping out 
                                              areas of public life where the 
                                              ruler or the ruling elite or 
                                              government has the right to 
                                              control and regulate the life and 
                                              affairs of the populace. In 
                                              contrast to this, the areas of 
                                              personal choice or action and 
                                              interpersonal relations and

                                              significant because, with regard

                                              privacy need to be theoretically 
                                              formulated and legally articulated

                                              have expressed recognition by 
                                              declaring without reservation that 
                                              the inherent dignity and 
                                              inalienable right of all the male 
                                              and female members of the human

                                              freedom, justice and peace in the 
                                              world.20 They also reaffirmed and 
                                              declared their faith in 
                                              fundamental human rights and in 
                                              the dignity and worth of the human 
                                              person as well as in the equal

                                              This recognition and affirmation 
                                              of faith in human rights led to 
                                              the formulation of a declaration 
                                              that everyone is entitled to all 
                                              the rights and freedoms &quot;without 
                                              distinction of any kind, such as

                                              United Nations, sponsoring as it 
                                              does an inherent concept of the 
                                              rights of women on a level of 
                                              equality with men, has not been 
                                              matched by practices in many 
                                              countries. Since the declaration 
                                              on 10 December 1948, blatant 
                                              violations of women's rights have 
                                              prevailed and continue unto this 
                                              day throughout the world, 
                                              particularly in the developing 
                                              countries. As a consequence, the 
                                              world body has consistently since 
                                              1948 made praiseworthy efforts to 
                                              correct or ameliorate this 
                                              anomalous imbalance by subsequent 
                                              declarations and conventions.23</span></p>

                                              In almost all societies in the 
                                              world, both primitive and 
                                              civilized, a lower status has been 
                                              given to women from a period 
                                              before the dawn of recorded 
                                              history to modern times. Until the 
                                              holocaust of the first world war 
                                              and the Nazi atrocities of the 
                                              second world war engendered the 
                                              formation of the League of Nations 
                                              and the United Nations 
                                              respectively, no articulated 
                                              recognition was ever given to 
                                              women's rights on the basis of 
                                              equality with men's. Typical of 
                                              the crude and untidy thinking of 
                                              the arrogant male before the 
                                              enlightenment of modern times, is 
                                              the effusions of respectable 
                                              philosophers like John Locke in 
                                              the seventeenth century and JJ 
                                              Rousseau in the eighteenth 
                                              century. These were men whose 
                                              ideas inspired the French 
                                              Revolution and offered the

                                              justification and impetus to the

                                              Yet in their writings on the 
                                              rights of man, they articulated 
                                              and apparently approved the now 
                                              obsolete notion and cultural 
                                              understanding of a past era, which

                                              innately possessed of certain 
                                              &quot;natural rights&quot; while women were 
                                              considered not as individuals as 
                                              such but as members of a man's 
                                              household and thus with their 
                                              children under the control of men. 
                                              Theoretically the rights so 
                                              accorded to men in their 
                                              formulation and conception of the

                                              tradition of the past were under

                                              this role in the name of the 
                                              Republic and does so as an

                                              perpetuate it. Surely its 
                                              consequence for the human rights 
                                              of the citizen involved can be 
                                              traumatic and disastrous.

                                              while treating its previous 
                                              decisions as normally binding, it 
                                              has constitutional authority in

                                              The hard core premise of this 
                                              &quot;higher law&quot; notion, is that it

                                              other laws and thus enjoys a 
                                              primacy that is unique. Its 
                                              imperative logic which would seem 
                                              to have impressed the fathers of 
                                              our Constitutions, is that it is 
                                              so supreme that any other law in a 
                                              constitutional [p.95] democracy

                                              effect of this transcendent 
                                              primacy is that any act done under

                                              which is inconsistent with the 
                                              human rights provisions or any 
                                              other provision of the 
                                              Constitution is unlawful. Whether 
                                              it is to the detriment of a 
                                              complainant or not is quite 
                                              irrelevant to the Constitutional

                                              dramatic effect of the 
                                              Constitution on the existing laws 
                                              is that they are all to be 
                                              construed with such modifications, 
                                              adaptations, qualifications and 
                                              exceptions as are necessary to 
                                              bring into conformity with the 
                                              provisions of the Constitution or 
                                              otherwise to give effect or enable 
                                              effect to be given to any changes 
                                              effected by the Constitution.57 
                                              The purport of this modification 
                                              clause is clear. As from 7 January 
                                              1993, the Constitution and 
                                              existing laws not inconsistent 
                                              with it, are the only true measure 
                                              of legality in Ghana.58&nbsp; This 
                                              means that all the laws that are 
                                              derogatory of the human rights 
                                              provisions of the constitution are 
                                              subject to modification to conform 
                                              to these rights. If however they 
                                              are not merely derogatory, but 
                                              inconsistent or conflicting and&nbsp; 
                                              cannot be saved by adaptation and 
                                              qualification then they cease to 
                                              be part of the laws of Ghana.</span></p>

                                              Constitutions, upon laws and upon 
                                              courts. These are false hopes; 
                                              believe me they are false hopes, 
                                              liberty lies in the hearts of men

                                              the two world wars. Even at the
