                                              There are, of course, many reasons 
                                              why some Gas elect or even prefer 
                                              to marry or get married by this 
                                              form of marriage rather than by 
                                              any of the other forms known to 
                                              the customary law. Some of these 
                                              reasons include the social 
                                              prestige or esteem which such 
                                              marriage imports and which it 
                                              confers not only on the couple who 
                                              contract it, but also on the issue 
                                              of that marriage, male or female. 
                                              One could imagine the extent or 
                                              measure of that prestige at a time 
                                              when that form of marriage ruled 
                                              the age as the most grandiose or 
                                              the form one could derive the

                                              to avow that the six-cloth

                                              status of an issue is taken to 
                                              such lengths that even where the 
                                              issue happens to be a female, 
                                              precedence is given to her in 
                                              selections of candidates to occupy 
                                              a constitutional office which a 
                                              female is not expressly 
                                              disqualified from holding. And 
                                              even where she is personally 
                                              disqualified, she is competent to 
                                              supply a male issue of hers to 
                                              take her place. This is one area 
                                              where the usual male hegemony in 
                                              Ga society may give way to female 
                                              primacy. There are a few such 
                                              instances in Ga history.6 In such 
                                              a case the elders or principal 
                                              members of a family first consult 
                                              with her for a&nbsp;&nbsp; [p.142] suitable 
                                              candidate and if none is available 
                                              from amongst her own issue, they 
                                              concede to her the right to 
                                              nominate a non-six-cloth member of

                                              case, her status is not dissimilar 
                                              to that of the Akan queenmother in

                                              if it was frivolous or manifestly

                                              his family which had the right to 
                                              condemn her issue or any of them

                                              during coverture, the husband had

                                              the husband for its harshness, but 
                                              this cannot obscure the fact that 
                                              such used to be the true custom in 
                                              vogue, which even now survives in

                                              More so, death was not allowed to

                                              consequence of this is that she 
                                              was still liable to be given in 
                                              levirate marriage (Kunayere

                                              depending on the availability of a

                                              husbands cognates. Here the

                                              gives way to the operation of a 
                                              cognatic principle whereby the 
                                              selection of the successor husband 
                                              could be made from either the 
                                              paternal or the maternal family of 
                                              the deceased husband. With growing 
                                              individualism, this practice is 
                                              now more honoured in its breach

                                              stand points they adopted. Both 
                                              proceeded on the false premises of 
                                              a Ga family system founded upon

                                              paternal principle is the

                                              a want of recognition of the male

                                              hinges. It is a failure to realise

                                              mixed patrilineal and matrilineal 
                                              stage of evolution of the original 
                                              agnatic family, it often still 
                                              happens to be organised or 
                                              constituted, not as a matriarchy (abusua), 
                                              but rather as a patriarchy 
                                              governed by paternal right. This 
                                              is shown by the fact that the head 
                                              of family is often elected or 
                                              approbated by virtue of such 
                                              paternal right. Male hegemony is 
                                              also evident in the concession or 
                                              admission customarily made by 
                                              uterine kinsmen within a family 
                                              that it is the agnatic members who 
                                              have the upper hand or the 
                                              controlling (or bigger) voice in

                                              affiliation; in inheritance

                                              However, when subsequently (and

                                              The better statement of the 
                                              position would be to aver that the 
                                              issue are actually by natural

                                              paternal family: whose name is 
                                              given to them in the same way that 
                                              a club gives its members their

                                              brought into being when a 
                                              university awards degrees to its 
                                              graduants. The award distinguishes

                                              deeper study of the areas of 
                                              discrimination entertained by Ga 
                                              custom in favour of six-cloth 
                                              children seems to suggest that 
                                              that custom treats the interests 
                                              of issue of a six-cloth marriage 
                                              as of greater moment, graver, more 
                                              profound in degree, more pervasive 
                                              and permanent than it treats the 
                                              interests of issue of those 
                                              marriages not being six-cloth 
                                              ones. That prima facie would seem 
                                              to be the foundation for giving 
                                              positions of importance in civic, 
                                              social and constitutional life to 
                                              such issue in preference to the 
                                              non-six-cloth issue of the same 
                                              father. As such positions often 
                                              carry with them avenues to 
                                              personal wealth, power, greater

                                              be a mere verbal contradiction of 
                                              social reality to continue to hold 
                                              that the principle of equality of

                                              be more honoured by breaches 
                                              thereof than by its observance. 
                                              For how else could one honestly 
                                              construe the evidence that, where 
                                              there is only one indivisible 
                                              interest to be enjoyed, such as a 
                                              single room, it is given as a 
                                              matter of course to a six-cloth

                                              informal marriage? Why is it that

                                              give more glaring weight to the 
                                              impression that six-cloth rights 
                                              are more entrenched.</span></p>

                                              of an unfettered right of 
                                              testation in any individual who, 
                                              durante vita, acquired some

                                              wisdom, in its determination to

                                              irreconcilable with a concept

                                              will bequeathing or devising all

                                              assured. Undoubtedly, if in one 
                                              breath Ga customary law holds out 
                                              the rights of six-cloth children 
                                              to be entrenched, the same&nbsp; law

                                              In early communities, however, a 
                                              will was something very different 
                                              from what it became later in law. 
                                              It took the form of a conveyance 
                                              or transfer which was neither 
                                              secret, ambulatory nor revocable. 
                                              It was made in contemplation of 
                                              impending death and took effect at 
                                              once. However, it was an abnormal 
                                              occurrence involving the diverting 
                                              of property from the family or 
                                              group to whom by custom it would 
                                              normally have passed and its 
                                              distribution according to the 
                                              wishes of the testator. This power 
                                              of diverting was usually limited 
                                              in its operation to a part only of 
                                              the disposer's property. It was 
                                              seldom allowed to interfere with 
                                              the right of the widow to a

                                              or not, dies intestate is for his

                                              wife by way of levirate marriage. 
                                              The late brother's children, 
                                              however come under his care. He is 
                                              expected to be their father in 
                                              much the same way as their natural 
                                              father had been to his issue.41 
                                              This social reality prima facie 
                                              cuts across the doctrine of nephew

                                              The main thrust, purport and 
                                              inspiration of Ga inheritance are 
                                              largely incompatible with nephew 
                                              inheritance for the foregoing and 
                                              following reasons. When the new 
                                              positional father dies, he is 
                                              likewise succeeded by his uterine 
                                              serho, male or female, seriatim 
                                              until the patriarchal generation45 
                                              is exhausted.46 But that is not 
                                              what is of immediate interest in 
                                              this connection. What we here wish 
                                              to draw attention to is the fact 
                                              that the children, in particular 
                                              the six-cloth children, become 
                                              immediately thereafter 
                                              reversioners, remainder men and 
                                              women, residuary legatees (using 
                                              the term as obtains in matters of 
                                              common law wills).&nbsp; In this 
                                              connection, children are deemed to 
                                              include nephews and nieces, 
                                              paternal or uterine. This depends 
                                              upon the bias prevailing in each 
                                              particular family. It is 
                                              impossible, and rash, to attempt 
                                              to lay down any stereotyped rule 
                                              here as to whether the nephew or 
                                              niece must be a paternal or 
                                              uterine one, for the circumstances 
                                              and usages tend to differ in this 
                                              respect from family to family. 
                                              Hence the need for caution.</span></p>

                                              This class of children eventually 
                                              step into the position left vacant 
                                              by the &quot;fathers&quot;, meaning their 
                                              natural father and his siblings. 
                                              Such was the pristine custom and 
                                              it is wrong therefore to 
                                              postulate, as was done in Omane v 
                                              Poku 47 [p.156] and other cases,

                                              a father only by reason of failure 
                                              of a father's maternal family. In 
                                              the Ga experience, whether or not 
                                              a paternal or maternal family 
                                              survives, children do succeed as 
                                              of right when the father and his 
                                              uterine siblings have passed away. 
                                              They even become entitled at once 
                                              to succeed if, besides being of 
                                              six-cloth status, they have been 
                                              made to observe the father-burial 
                                              custom. Their right of succession 
                                              in this respect is independent of 
                                              the continued existence vel non of 
                                              a family, paternal or maternal. It 
                                              just naturally happens to be their 
                                              natural turn and not a matter of 
                                              concession at all. For this 
                                              reason, it must be underscored 
                                              that the whole gamut of chapter 27 
                                              of Ollennu's book48 dealing with 
                                              the failure of the maternal family 
                                              is quite irrelevant in both its 
                                              philosophy, doctrine and concept, 
                                              so far as Ga Mashi is concerned.</span></p>

                                              In Ga custom, one of the solemn 
                                              obligations of adult children is 
                                              to &quot;bury their father&quot;: tsefuu. 
                                              This means that they are bound, as 
                                              a matter of custom, to provide the 
                                              most important things to assure 
                                              the most decent burial for their 
                                              father on his passing away from 
                                              this life. The most important 
                                              things for this purpose are, of 
                                              course, the shroud (or nowadays 
                                              his suit) and the coffin in which 
                                              he would lie entombed. These may 
                                              be commuted to cash. As is to be 
                                              expected, the six-cloth children 
                                              have a special duty in this 
                                              matter. If the father was lucky 
                                              enough to have had daughters with 
                                              responsible husbands, such 
                                              husbands, by Ga, unlike Fanti 
                                              custom, are expected (even 
                                              obliged) to contribute to the 
                                              expenses of the burial. They are 
                                              therefore customarily notified to 
                                              come to fulfil their obligation to

                                              their father's face before his 
                                              wife's or perhaps their mother's 
                                              family. They usually gladly oblige 
                                              by responding gleefully and with 
                                              pride in their breasts for being 
                                              able to rise to the occasion. 
                                              Where their father has predeceased 
                                              their mother, the duty to bury 
                                              their mother also devolves in Ga 
                                              custom on the adult &quot;children&quot; on 
                                              the mother's death.</span></p>

                                              When, however, it is the father 
                                              who predeceases the wife or whose 
                                              burial&nbsp; is in point, the children 
                                              gleefully respond to the paternal 
                                              family's invitation to &quot;bury their 
                                              father&quot; for a special reason. Ga 
                                              custom is: moni fuor kpititse le, 
                                              lenonn eklo-or etokotai, meaning: 
                                              &quot;he who buries a leper is as of 
                                              right the very one who is entitled 
                                              to his sandals.&quot; The invitation to 
                                              the children to bury their father, 
                                              therefore, carries the implication 
                                              that they are those whom the 
                                              paternal family have recognised 
                                              and will support as eligible to 
                                              inherit the father's properties, 
                                              real or personal. Evidently, this 
                                              is the same philosophy that 
                                              inspires the Akan custom 
                                              allocating the wife's burial to 
                                              her abusua, as Danquah 
                                              highlighted. It is therefore an 
                                              obtuse statement of Ga custom to 
                                              aver categorically that a &quot;family&quot; 
                                              or even the serho (kyiriba) 
                                              succeeds automatically when the 
                                              children have dutifully observed 
                                              the father's burial custom. In 
                                              this event, the children must 
                                              succeed, not mediately, but at 
                                              once. The oversight of the jurists 
                                              in this respect is remarkable and 
                                              very pernicious.</span></p>

                                              If such eligible children are too

                                              of the successor's office is what 
                                              gave birth to the pernicious 
                                              assumption harboured by most 
                                              successors that they could do as

                                              therefore to be treated as wholly 
                                              out-moded, and no longer to be

                                              [1976] 2 GLR 46, your writer 
                                              trusts that never again will any 
                                              court lend its weight to such 
                                              virtual disinheritance and 
                                              deprivation of children however 
                                              born as was inequitably done in 
                                              Adom v Kwarley (supra). The true 
                                              position is that if a six-cloth 
                                              father diverts all his property 
                                              from his dependants especially his 
                                              wife and children he abjures and 
                                              unlawfully violates the solemn 
                                              obligations and assumptions of the 
                                              type of marriage he so voluntarily 
                                              contracted.</span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

                                              avoid making nonsense of the 
                                              inalienable interests of the wife 
                                              and children of the six-cloth 
                                              status, otherwise the donor is 
                                              deemed by Ga custom to have 
                                              committed a fraud on the family of 
                                              the wife with which the donor had 
                                              contracted the six-cloth marriage. 
                                              The six-cloth father would be free 
                                              to alienate his self-acquired 
                                              property from the six-cloth 
                                              children only if he causes the
