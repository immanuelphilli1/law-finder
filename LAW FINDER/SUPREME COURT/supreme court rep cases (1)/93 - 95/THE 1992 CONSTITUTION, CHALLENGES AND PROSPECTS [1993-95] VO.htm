                                              The Constitution of 1992 has 
                                              respectable antecedents in the 
                                              Constitutions of 1969 and 1979. 
                                              When the Government of the First 
                                              Republic was overthrown in 1966, 
                                              few gave the impression of a 
                                              realisation that we had overthrown 
                                              a constitutional order. To them we 
                                              had done away with a dictatorship. 
                                              That was enough. The government 
                                              which succeeded it lasted roughly 
                                              three and a half years, ie 
                                              February 1966—August 1969. 
                                              Immediately after the overthrow, 
                                              both the government and people 
                                              plunged into finding out &quot;what 
                                              went wrong&quot; with the First 
                                              Republic. How did it happen that 
                                              the euphoria of the late 1950s 
                                              (remember we had our independence 
                                              in 1957) quickly turned sour; that 
                                              the high hopes and expectations 
                                              evaporated into smoke; and 
                                              self-government became a 
                                              nightmare. It was generally agreed 
                                              that the root cause of the malaise 
                                              was that power, especially 
                                              executive power, got concentrated 
                                              in the hands of one man, and that 
                                              this power was obviously abused. 
                                              This concentration of power was 
                                              later to be given constitutional 
                                              approval, when the Constitution, 
                                              1960 proclaimed Ghana as a &quot;one 
                                              party unitary State.&quot; The wisemen 
                                              who, after the 1966 coup, were 
                                              given the responsibility of 
                                              helping us draft a new 
                                              Constitution in such a way as will 
                                              avoid a repetition of the problems 
                                              of the pre-1966 era were quick to 
                                              realise that there was only one 
                                              solution—viz, that whatever we 
                                              did, we must try to ensure that 
                                              power was diffused, and that there 
                                              must be effective checks on the 
                                              exercise of executive authority. 
                                              This was the philosophical 
                                              underpinning of the Constitution, 
                                              1969.</span></p>

                                              The fear engendered in us by our 
                                              earlier experience made us go to 
                                              great lengths to provide for such 
                                              machinery as will, we hoped, make 
                                              it impossible for any one man to 
                                              wield absolute power. The 
                                              Constitution, 1969 carefully 
                                              crafted and structured, became the 
                                              model for the Constitution, 1979 
                                              as well as the Constitution, 1992 
                                              save that the Constitution, 1992 
                                              carried over some features of the 
                                              immediately preceding military 
                                              order of the previous ten years. 
                                              Basically, however, we can say 
                                              that the Constitution, 1992 is the 
                                              third edition of the Constitution, 
                                              1969, the second edition being the 
                                              Constitution, 1979. Unfortunately, 
                                              both (Constitutions, 1969 and 
                                              1979) failed; or is it more 
                                              accurate to say they were not 
                                              given the chance to succeed? Each 
                                              lasted no more than 27 months. It 
                                              is however not the length of their 
                                              lives that matters; it is the fact 
                                              that both were accepted by all as 
                                              democratic.</span></p>

                                              With the [p.29] ballot box rapidly 
                                              losing credibility as a measure of 
                                              democracy, if it has not already 
                                              done so with us (we only need to 
                                              look no further than our part of 
                                              the world for support for this 
                                              statement), it appears that we can 
                                              tell a democratic order by the 
                                              extent to which the exercise of 
                                              executive power is held in cheek 
                                              at all significant levels, 
                                              especially with respect to the 
                                              government's human rights 
                                              performance. The readiness and the 
                                              ability of the executive to live 
                                              and operate within these checks 
                                              would seem to be a fair measure of 
                                              whether the government is 
                                              democratic or authoritarian; and 
                                              whether the state is one which 
                                              qualifies as a democratic state 
                                              fit to be accommodated in the 
                                              comity of matured nations.</span></p>

                                              By now, many of you may know this 
                                              clause by heart. But, you see, 
                                              familiarity breeds contempt. 
                                              Over-familiarity with the passage 
                                              can be dangerous; it may induce 
                                              you to forget, or at least gloss 
                                              over its significance; yet these 
                                              words are significant. Their 
                                              import cannot be overemphasised. 
                                              To me they imply that in this 
                                              country everything that is done, 
                                              every law that exists or is 
                                              passed, every movement of any 
                                              person, citizen or not, must have 
                                              its lawfulness or legality, its 
                                              regularity anchored in the 
                                              Constitution, otherwise it is 
                                              unlawful. If you have reason to 
                                              believe that anything done by any 
                                              person whatsoever—the President, 
                                              Parliament, the courts, the 
                                              tribunals, public or private 
                                              corporations or any individual at 
                                              all, cannot be justified by 
                                              reference to the Constitution, 
                                              that action must be unlawful. That 
                                              is why and how the Constitution is 
                                              the fundamental law of the land. 
                                              Maybe I am overstating the case. 
                                              It is deliberate, for you may 
                                              argue that many, many actions are 
                                              lawful by virtue of laws other 
                                              than the Constitution. This is 
                                              true, save that those statutes 
                                              themselves can be valid only if so 
                                              declared by the Constitution. If 
                                              the Constitution says that a 
                                              particular statute is unlawful, I 
                                              wonder whether an act based on 
                                              that statute can be lawful. 
                                              Therefore at the end of the day, 
                                              the determining agent is the 
                                              Constitution; it is the 
                                              fundamental law, the law against 
                                              which all other laws are measured.</span></p>

                                              But, of course, it is one thing 
                                              saying that you consider an act 
                                              unlawful, looking on for it to 
                                              continue, as a child gazes upon a 
                                              floating balloon in the skies; and 
                                              quite another thing taking some 
                                              steps to get that action expressly 
                                              declared unlawful and brought to a 
                                              halt. In other words, it is not 
                                              enough to know that an action is 
                                              unconstitutional and unlawful. 
                                              What is important is to do 
                                              something about it.</span></p>

                                              under article 2(4) of the 
                                              Constitution, if only because he 
                                              would have acted in wilful 
                                              violation of the oath of 
                                              allegiance and the presidential 
                                              oath, as well as of the provisions 
                                              of the Constitution.1 But for 
                                              this, and the prerogative writs, 
                                              the President and his vice are 
                                              immune from court process with 
                                              regard to anything done by them in 
                                              the discharge of the functions of 
                                              their high office.2 If an act 
                                              complained of as inconsistent with 
                                              the Constitution sounds in a 
                                              breach of any of the fundamental 
                                              freedoms and rights, the Supreme 
                                              Court ceases to have original 
                                              jurisdiction; the action has to 
                                              commence in the High Court.3</span></p>

                                              The Constitution is written in a 
                                              language which I will regard as 
                                              ordinary. Somehow the impression 
                                              has been created (I do not know by 
                                              whom) that the Constitution is a 
                                              difficult and mysterious document, 
                                              such that only lawyers can unravel 
                                              the mysteries therein contained. I 
                                              am sure many of you have come 
                                              across highly educated members of 
                                              society who do not happen to be 
                                              lawyers, and who have observed to 
                                              you: &quot;well, this is a matter for

                                              for discussion. This perception, 
                                              right or wrong, exists and imposes 
                                              on the profession a serious 
                                              responsibility.</span></p>

                                              The public look to the Bar and the 
                                              bench for guidance through the 
                                              Constitution, as well as for the 
                                              proper interpretation and 
                                              application of its several 
                                              provisions. To be able to do this 
                                              effectively we must ourselves be 
                                              well-acquainted with, and possess 
                                              an in-depth knowledge of the 
                                              document. It is not enough to have 
                                              a smattering of just a few 
                                              chapters. As lawyers, the chapters 
                                              on the judiciary and on the 
                                              fundamental human rights and 
                                              freedoms offer themselves readily 
                                              for close study. So also, for 
                                              obvious reasons, are the 
                                              transitional provisions. But you 
                                              will be surprised how much is 
                                              embedded in the other chapters, 
                                              some of which we may be tempted to 
                                              ignore. A profound knowledge of 
                                              the Constitution is a

                                              a suspected infringement of a

                                              instituted in the court, there is 
                                              nothing the court can do. More 
                                              importantly, the court cannot file 
                                              cases unto itself. This the public 
                                              must know and appreciate. Part of

                                              court. There is the tendency to 
                                              think that the courts are not

                                              very useful role here. You may 
                                              take up the responsibility of 
                                              educating the public. I do not see

                                              suited to perform this role than 
                                              this association. I know that a

                                              association has been formed and 
                                              has proclaimed its preparedness to 
                                              take up human rights cases on 
                                              behalf of members of the public. 
                                              This is a laudable objective. But 
                                              it strikes me that this is not 
                                              enough. We should begin and aim at 
                                              intensive education of the public.

                                              general statements in general 
                                              terms that we have these rights 
                                              and that they are guaranteed by 
                                              the Constitution; fair enough. We 
                                              are yet to get the public to 
                                              appreciate what the rights mean in 
                                              their daily lives, and how they 
                                              can pursue them. Let me here give 
                                              you a few examples to indicate how 
                                              my mind is working.</span></p>

                                              You are driving along a street in 
                                              Accra. You see a man handcuffed, 
                                              naked to the waist, followed by 
                                              three hefty police officers 
                                              wielding batons, and a sizeable 
                                              crowd, some shouting yile, yile 
                                              (beat him, beat him). This man 
                                              must obviously have done 
                                              something, and is being marched to 
                                              the nearest police station. But 
                                              this man, in the circumstances I 
                                              have described, is in no position 
                                              to do any harm to anybody; he 
                                              cannot run away, he cannot strike 
                                              anyone. Indeed, he is helpless and 
                                              harmless at that stage. And yet, 
                                              [p.32] egged on by the shouts of 
                                              yile, yile and to show that &quot;they 
                                              are they&quot;, so to speak, the police 
                                              take turns kicking and slapping 
                                              this man and even baton-charging 
                                              him, believing that the public are 
                                              enjoying this display of sadism. 
                                              The scenario I have painted is a 
                                              common occurrence, and one which 
                                              many of you do witness from time 
                                              to time in our towns and cities. 
                                              The question I ask is: Does this 
                                              man know that he has any rights 
                                              which are being infringed?&nbsp; Have 
                                              we done enough by way of education 
                                              to let him know this? Are we 
                                              ourselves aware of any such 
                                              rights? Quite apart from notions 
                                              of assault, etc, is his dignity as 
                                              a human being also being 
                                              affronted? If so, are we waiting 
                                              for this man to come to our 
                                              chambers to consult us before we 
                                              help, or do we think we ought, as

                                              conference, strategies to aid 
                                              people in such circumstances?</span></p>

                                              to bed. In the morning of the 
                                              third day the cell is opened, and 
                                              he is found dead. Are there any 
                                              questions of the right to life

                                              us talk about ourselves. Shortly 
                                              before the legal recess, there was 
                                              this lawyer who was telling the 
                                              Supreme Court that a case of his 
                                              (I won't tell you from where) had

                                              seriously. In particular, we 
                                              should come down to specifics and 
                                              to details so that the public may 
                                              know, almost by intuition, when a 
                                              right is infringed, and what 
                                              should follow. Those members of 
                                              the public who are financially 
                                              able to do so, may pursue their 
                                              interests alright. But as you and 
                                              I know, by far the vast majority 
                                              of the populace are not able; and 
                                              for their sakes, given your 
                                              training and expertise, you have a 
                                              duty to map out adequate and 
                                              effective strategies to come to 
                                              their aid. You have a lot of 
                                              satisfaction to be derived in this 
                                              endeavour, even if you may not be 
                                              sufficiently rewarded in money 
                                              terms. You may wish to include, in 
                                              the strategies you may have in 
                                              mind, consideration of contingent 
                                              actions in human rights cases.</span></p>

                                              The problem with human rights is 
                                              that there is the tendency for 
                                              some people to think—at least they 
                                              behave as if they think—that these 
                                              rights exist for their benefit 
                                              only, and no one else's. They 
                                              forget that they exist for all and 
                                              are intended to be enjoyed by all, 
                                              enforced by all against all. This 
                                              is what I call the triangular 
                                              rule. You want to look at the 
                                              right to free speech for example. 
                                              I have that right; you have that 
                                              right; and he too has that right. 
                                              Between us, we complete the 
                                              triangle. To derive the maximum 
                                              benefit from this right, 
                                              therefore, we three must evolve 
                                              some conventions, written or 
                                              unwritten, for its exercise. For 
                                              instance, in a certain situation, 
                                              it may become necessary that if we 
                                              are to exercise the right at the 
                                              same place, and at the same time (eg, 
                                              passengers travelling on a bus), 
                                              we have to watch the pitch at 
                                              which we speak, if the bus is not 
                                              to be turned into a mad house, a 
                                              bedlam. So we impose limitations 
                                              on ourselves.</span></p>

                                              the right to move freely anywhere 
                                              in Ghana.4 He may soon find 
                                              himself in the mortuary, run over 
                                              by a vehicle whose driver also 
                                              has, indisputably, the right to 
                                              move freely anywhere in Ghana. To 
                                              stay alive therefore, he has to 
                                              watch where he moves, when and 
                                              how. In other words, a good and 
                                              balanced education will dispose 
                                              the people to know what to expect, 
                                              and what others expect of them.</span></p>

                                              It strikes me that, all things 
                                              considered, you will be far more 
                                              effective as instructors and 
                                              facilitators, than anyone else.</span></p>

                                              Let me now touch on a matter of 
                                              some concern to some of us. 
                                              Sometime before the constitutional 
                                              order commenced, there was a spate 
                                              of constitutional suits in the 
                                              courts. Decisions on them became 
                                              the subject of heated debates in 
                                              our journals and newspapers. I am 
                                              not here concerned with whether I 
                                              agreed or disagreed with any or 
                                              all or none of the decisions and 
                                              rulings, nor whether they were 
                                              correct or otherwise. I mention 
                                              them here because it appears that 
                                              in a number of those cases, the 
                                              preparation seemed less than 
                                              adequate, given what was 
                                              published. The problem did not lie 
                                              with the subject matter of the 
                                              controversies, as with the 
                                              preparation of the cases. It 
                                              should be observed that the level 
                                              of preparation often dictates the 
                                              court's reaction to a particular 
                                              case, and is bound to influence 
                                              its outcome. I refrain from 
                                              mentioning any case in particular. 
                                              Such a reference may too easily be 
                                              misconstrued. Besides, some of the 
                                              cases may, unknown to me, be on 
                                              their way up. In the 
                                              circumstances, I can only make 
                                              general statements. Standing 
                                              before many elderly and learned 
                                              practitioners, I feel very 
                                              uncomfortable making statements 
                                              about practice. A lot of what I am 
                                              about to say I have picked from 
                                              some of these senior 
                                              practitioners, and need not be 
                                              repeated back to them. It is 
                                              therefore not intended for them. I 
                                              realise, however, that we have 
                                              within our ranks a fair number of 
                                              young ones who may not have had 
                                              the benefit of this kind of 
                                              experience, and for their sake I 
                                              feel justified in making the 
                                              observations which follow.</span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
                                              <span style="font-family: Arial">
                                              It is good to know, at least for 
                                              purposes of our examinations at 
                                              the teaching institutions, all 
                                              that there is to know about civil 
                                              and criminal [p.35] procedure, and 
                                              the laws of evidence. I suspect 
                                              that there may be many lawyers 
                                              around who may know the Evidence 
                                              Decree, 1975 (NRCD 323) almost by 
                                              heart. This knowledge is useful. 
                                              But it is also useful to know that 
                                              the good lawyer does, or should 
                                              do, a lot of writing; this is 
                                              essential to good case 
                                              preparation, at least in the early 
                                              years of practice. But I have 
                                              known very senior lawyers, even 
                                              QC's, who will not appear in court 
                                              without a lot of writing.</span></p>

                                              Since the introduction of written 
                                              briefs in the Supreme Court, 
                                              counsel are forced to put their 
                                              thoughts on paper any way, whether 
                                              the jurisdiction being invoked be 
                                              original, supervisory, appellate

                                              courts, where virtually every case

                                              called for, especially in terms of 
                                              evidence, and yet it seems that it 
                                              is at these levels that not much 
                                              writing is done.</span></p>

                                              to the several jurisdictions of 
                                              the Supreme Court. The 
                                              pronouncements of the Supreme 
                                              Court are final, but final only in 
                                              the sense that it is the final 
                                              appellate court, the last court to 
                                              which anyone can take any 
                                              grievance. There is no 
                                              adjudicating authority over and 
                                              above, or beyond it. But our 
                                              decisions are not final in the 
                                              sense that they are ipso facto 
                                              correct, or that after the Supreme 
                                              Court has spoken, nobody else 
                                              should. Some of the decisions may 
                                              be atrocious, not deliberately so, 
                                              but because we are human and 
                                              liable to err. The Constitution 
                                              allows us to depart from those 
                                              which we may later discover to be 
                                              faulty. To aid in this exercise of 
                                              discovery, one would expect that 
                                              the Bar will subject our decisions 
                                              to constant scrutiny and 
                                              assessment, and not wait for new 
                                              cases to arise before seeking to 
                                              persuade us to depart from a 
                                              previous wrong decision. In the 
                                              nature of things, judges have no 
                                              platform to perform this task. And 
                                              as for writing into magazines and 
                                              newspapers, even under pen-names, 
                                              this may not be advisable for 
                                              serving judges in a small society 
                                              like ours. The persons to 
                                              discharge this function therefore 
                                              must be you. So far this is not 
                                              being done. It may be that in the 
                                              past the decisions had been of 
                                              pure civil and criminal matters, 
                                              and therefore not sufficiently 
                                              appetising. In the present 
                                              constitutional order, I will 
                                              expect a more vigorous and

                                              regard to decisions affecting the

                                              said, we run away with the 
                                              impression that all is well. What 
                                              I wish to see is a professional 
                                              and informed assessment of what we 
                                              write; not a partisan and, if I 
                                              may say so, narrow-minded 
                                              diatribes, born of pique for 
                                              losing a case. I am not here 
                                              thinking of lengthy academic 
                                              [p.37] treatises on the issues at 
                                              stake; we can leave these to 
                                              academia. I have in mind short 
                                              articles professionally written 
                                              from a practitioner's standpoint.</span></p>

                                              When the legal practitioner takes 
                                              hold of a judgment or a ruling, he 
                                              wants to find therein the issues 
                                              to be decided and the judge's 
                                              decision on each of those issues. 
                                              In the process the judge may have 
                                              to advance reasoned arguments in 
                                              support of his conclusions. But 
                                              reasoned arguments need not be 
                                              equated with a stringing together 
                                              of quotable quotes, cliches, or of 
                                              all the rules and canons of 
                                              interpretation known to the writer 
                                              of a text. Many a time, these 
                                              canons, if put together in the 
                                              same ruling, tend to get in each 
                                              other's way, and end up confusing 
                                              the reader as to the logical 
                                              relevance of any of them to the 
                                              arguments in hand.</span></p>

                                              These days judgments are becoming 
                                              longer and longer, a practice to 
                                              which many of us, I included, 
                                              readily plead guilty. The length 
                                              of a judgment is a function of the 
                                              facts and the issues of the 
                                              particular case. But no matter how 
                                              long a judgment may be, there can 
                                              be no excuse for befogging the 
                                              issues and making the decision 
                                              unclear. It may be that some of 
                                              our judgments suffer from these 
                                              defects. Unfortunately, the Bar is 
                                              yet to place itself in such a 
                                              position as to be able to assist 
                                              us to correct them.</span></p>

                                              Not too long ago the Bar was kind 
                                              enough to give some of us 
                                              complimentary copies of a 
                                              magazine. It was beautifully laid 
                                              out, and contained very useful and 
                                              interesting reading material. That 
                                              was a very good beginning, for 
                                              which the Bar has my 
                                              congratulations. I formed the 
                                              impression that we were going to 
                                              see more of it. So far, I haven't. 
                                              I am still hoping that it will 
                                              re-appear. But may I, in all 
                                              humility, take advantage of my 
                                              presence here to offer a few 
                                              suggestions. With the demise, so I 
                                              learn, of the Ghana Law Reports 
                                              Digest, you may consider 
                                              publishing your magazine in 
                                              shorter intervals, say, for a 
                                              start, every three months. The 
                                              publication should not aim at 
                                              rivalling the Review of Ghana Law, 
                                              or any such magazine. It should 
                                              rather target the busy 
                                              practitioner so that while it may 
                                              have a few pages of association 
                                              tit-bits—notices, activities, new 
                                              publications, if any, etc—the bulk 
                                              of the magazine should be devoted 
                                              to intelligent summaries of court 
                                              decisions and some notes on recent 
                                              legislations. The publication must 
                                              be sufficiently indexed, to 
                                              enhance its usefulness. Mind you, 
                                              the busy practitioner has not much 
                                              time to read through lengthy 
                                              judgments from us, even if he has 
                                              copies. I cannot tell how current 
                                              the law reports are now going to 
                                              be; but even if they happen to be, 
                                              there is always room for synoptic 
                                              publications of the kind being 
                                              advocated here, provided the 
                                              standard is high enough. The Bar 
                                              may consider stepping into the 
                                              vacuum created by the demise of 
                                              the Ghana Law Reports Digest. 
                                              These days, almost every venture 
                                              has a money motive. The 
                                              publication I am recommending to 
                                              you, if properly handled, cannot 
                                              be a commercial failure. If the 
                                              Bar, as a body, cannot take it on, 
                                              maybe a few enterprising young men 
                                              may seriously consider this, as a
