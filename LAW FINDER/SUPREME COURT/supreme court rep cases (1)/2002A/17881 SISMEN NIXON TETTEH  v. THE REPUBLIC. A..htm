												The complainant in this case was 
												an officer in the Ghana Armed 
												Forces. He was the Provost 
												Marshall. His duties touched on 
												security and discipline within 
												the armed Forces. The appellant 
												on the other hand was a 
												corporal. He had had 19 years 
												military service to his credit.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the night of 19th November, 
												1996, the appellant was alleged 
												to have done something very 
												strange. The appellant who was 
												then living in barracks in the 
												Burma Camp in Accra had earlier 
												in the day left the barracks to 
												town. He spent much time in 
												town. At the time he was driving 
												back to the barracks at about 
												11.30 p.m. the Provost Marshall 
												was also driving into the Burma 
												Camp. According to the 
												prosecution the Provost Marshall 
												stopped at the Burma Camp 
												traffic light because the red 
												light was on, meaning all 
												vehicles must stop. But as he 
												waited, a car from behind drove 
												past him, ignoring the red 
												signal. When the green light 
												came on, the Provost Marshall 
												decided to find out the person 
												who drove through the red light. 
												He therefore followed the other 
												car and found it parked near a 
												house. The owner came out and 
												was about to enter his room when 
												the Provost Marshall walked up 
												to him and, recognizing the 
												appellant, the Provost Marshall 
												asked why he drove through the 
												red traffic light. The appellant 
												said the red light was not on. 
												The denial surprised the 
												complainant and he asked for the 
												appellant&#8217;s identity card. 
												According to the prosecution the 
												appellant produced the card; but 
												when he realized that the 
												complainant intended to keep the 
												card and also lodge a complaint 
												against him he decided to 
												collect back his card. During 
												the struggle he was alleged to 
												have hit the complainant in the 
												face with a blow. The 
												complainant fell down and the 
												appellant sat over him and 
												rained blows on him. Some people 
												who were around the scene went 
												to the rescue of the 
												complainant. When freed, the 
												complainant rushed to the 
												military police and reported the 
												incident. Men were sent to 
												arrest the appellant but the 
												appellant was combative and 
												engaged them in a fight. It took 
												a three-man reinforcement to 
												overpower the appellant and 
												confine him to cells. He was 
												later charged with the typically 
												military offences of (1) 
												striking a superior officer, (2) 
												use of violence against a 
												superior officer and (3) conduct 
												prejudicial to good order and 
												discipline. The appellant denied 
												the offences.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												He defence was that he was 
												returning from town to the 
												barracks that night when he 
												realized that another car was 
												following him. When he was 
												checked at the traffic light and 
												allowed to go, he realized that 
												the car was still following him, 
												and when he stopped in front of 
												his room and was about to enter 
												the man caught up with him and 
												asked for his identity card. He 
												did not know who the man was. It 
												was dark and he could not 
												identify the man, not even by 
												his voice. He showed the card to 
												the man and the man pounced on 
												him and started struggling with 
												him to collect the card. In the 
												process the two of them fell 
												down. Then some neighbours came 
												and separated them. Later, some 
												military policemen came to 
												arrest him. He called two 
												witnesses including his wife who 
												can properly be described as an 
												eyewitness. The wife&#8217;s evidence 
												suggested that the struggle 
												between the two men began when 
												the complainant held the 
												appellant&#8217;s &#8220;trousers and held 
												the shirt at his chest&#8221;. She 
												said she shouted and one S/Sgt. 
												Otu came; but before Otu arrived 
												the appellant &#8220;was trying to 
												release himself from the grips 
												of the man and they all fell&#8221;.&nbsp; 
												S/Sgt Otu was the next witness. 
												He told the court that he was 
												asleep when he heard an unusual 
												noise and when he rushed out he 
												&#8220;saw two men holding each other. 
												I went there and separated 
												them&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The court itself called one 
												witness who happened to be the 
												wife of the complainant. She was 
												in the car with the complainant 
												and could also be properly 
												described as an eyewitness. Her 
												evidence was that when she and 
												the complainant got to 
												appellant&#8217;s house the 
												complainant came out of the car 
												but she remained inside. The 
												appellant&#8217;s car had parked right 
												in front of the building. 
												According to her when 
												complainant got there, &#8220;a 
												gentleman came out from that car 
												so later on there was an 
												argument between the two (2) of 
												them. It turned to a struggle 
												and that was when I went to the 
												scene. When I got there the 
												Colonel and the gentleman were 
												on the floor. The people around 
												came to separate them which I 
												also took part&#8221;.&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In ordinary legal terms the 
												offence of striking an officer 
												is the offence of assault. The 
												evidence of the appellant 
												suggested the defence of self 
												defence which the trial court 
												martial was bound to consider in 
												arriving at its decision. The 
												record shows that the trial 
												court apparently did not look at 
												the case of the appellant. I 
												will come back to that issue 
												soon. Meanwhile what is the 
												appellant&#8217;s case in this court?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												He has argued two grounds of 
												appeal before us. He says that 
												the convictions in respect of 
												the three charges are wrong and 
												that the sentence of dismissal 
												is harsh and excessive. The two 
												grounds of appeal are that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) The dismissal of the appeal 
												against all the counts was wrong 
												in law because the prosecution 
												failed to call material 
												witnesses and consequently 
												failed to establish a case 
												against the appellant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) The dismissal of the appeal 
												cannot be supported in law 
												because the Court of Appeal 
												failed to evaluate and or 
												consider thoroughly the 
												appellant&#8217;s plea that the 
												sentence was harsh and 
												excessive.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Coming back to the judgment of 
												the Disciplinary Court-Martial. 
												I think it leaves much to be 
												desired. The offences charged, 
												having regard to the penalty 
												involved, were serious. The 
												court-martial itself remarked 
												that &#8220;The Court has realized 
												that the gravity of the offence 
												is very great&#8221;. In such a case, 
												and particularly because the 
												appellant denied the offences, 
												calling for a full trial, the 
												law requires that the decision 
												must take the form of a reasoned 
												judgment in which the court sets 
												out the reasons for the 
												conviction. Contrary to this 
												honoured principle of our 
												criminal jurisprudence the 
												judgment of the trial court was 
												a terse one sentence of 
												conviction. The record of 
												proceedings shows that the 
												President of the court read all 
												the three counts and said &#8220;The 
												court finds the accused guilty 
												on all the three counts&#8221;. That 
												was all. No conviction was even 
												recorded. The court simply 
												proceeded to call for the past 
												record of the appellant and when 
												it was furnished, the sentence 
												of dismissal was pronounced. Two 
												errors seem to have been 
												committed, namely, that there 
												was no reasoned judgment and 
												there was no conviction. The 
												Court of Appeal took no account 
												of the absence of the conviction 
												and as for the omission of a 
												reasoned judgment, the court 
												said it was not essential. In 
												the judgment of Justice S.G. 
												Baddoo in which the other two 
												Judges concurred, the Learned 
												Judge held that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;An additional ground was filed 
												on behalf of the appellant that 
												the Court did not give reasons 
												for its decision contrary to 
												section 177(1) of Act 30.&nbsp; In 
												the case of WO1 Awudu Gamel v. 
												Republic 1/98 Criminal appeal 
												unreported, Afreh J.A. held 
												that: &#8216;Court-martial is like a 
												jury. If its conclusion can be 
												supported by evidence before it, 
												an appellate [SIC] court should 
												not normally disturb it&#8217;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I aree with the learned Judge 
												that if there is evidence to 
												support the decision, the 
												appellate court will not disturb 
												the judgment. In this case, it 
												is my considered opinion that 
												there is evidence to support the 
												decision of the disciplinary 
												court-martial. The appeal is 
												therefore dismissed on all 
												grounds&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The point made by the court is 
												grave enough to merit scrutiny. 
												It is to be observed that three 
												propositions were advanced 
												before the Court of Appeal 
												namely that,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) The court martial ought to 
												have given a reasoned judgment 
												when it decided to convict the 
												appellant;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) A court martial is not 
												obliged to give a reasoned 
												judgment;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3) The failure to give a 
												reasoned judgment is of no 
												consequence if an appellate 
												court finds that there is 
												sufficient evidence on the 
												record to justify the decision 
												of the trial court martial.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The judgment of the Court of 
												Appeal in effect rejected 
												proposition (1) and gave its 
												support to propositions (2) and 
												(3). I feel rather reluctant to 
												accept the proposition that a 
												court martial is not under a 
												duty to give a reasoned judgment 
												for the reason that its decision 
												is like the decision of a jury. 
												I think the equation is 
												misleading. In the first place, 
												it appears to me that a 
												court-martial is a peculiar 
												court which is sui generis and 
												basically not analogous to a 
												jury. The Disciplinary court 
												martial created under or Armed 
												Forces Act 1960, Act 105, sits 
												as a panel of judges and each 
												member is expected to make his 
												own decision. Section 70(1) of 
												the Act actually provides that 
												&#8220;A disciplinary court-martial 
												shall consist of not less than 
												three officers and not more than 
												such number of officers as may 
												be prescribed&#8221;. These members 
												are the judges of both fact and 
												law.&nbsp; Their decision will have 
												to be unanimous or by the 
												majority. The President of the 
												court takes an active part in 
												the decision-making process. A 
												trial by jury is a different 
												procedure. The jury are the 
												final arbiters who decide on the 
												verdict. The judge does not take 
												part in the decision of guilt or 
												innocence. His only duty is to 
												direct the jury and instruct 
												them on the principles of law 
												that will guide them in reaching 
												a decision on the guilt or 
												innocence of the accused. He 
												must include in his instructions 
												to the jury the elements of the 
												offence charged, the nature of 
												the evidence needed to establish 
												the offence and the burden on 
												the prosecution to prove its 
												case in order to secure a guilty 
												verdict. The difference here is 
												the non-participation of the 
												judge in the decision in a jury 
												trial. It is therefore not 
												appropriate to say that a 
												court-martial is like a jury. I 
												would rather liken the 
												court-martial to a panel of 
												judges hearing a case summarily. 
												The panel is both the judge and 
												the jury just like a single 
												judge hearing a case summarily. 
												In my opinion a court-martial 
												cannot be equated with a jury.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												If a court-martial is not a 
												jury, must it then give reasons 
												for its decision?&nbsp; I think it 
												must. Every criminal trial must 
												be regulated by the procedure 
												laid down in the Criminal 
												Procedure Code subject to any 
												provisions to the contrary in 
												any other enactment. The code, 
												(act 30 of 1960) provides for 
												the procedure governing all 
												criminal trials. It provides in 
												section 1 that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;All offences under the Criminal 
												Code and, subject to the 
												provisions of any enactment, all 
												other offences shall be enquired 
												into, tried and otherwise dealt 
												with according to this code&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The language is clear. The Act 
												embraces all criminal offences. 
												A military service offence is 
												clearly within its ambit, 
												particularly as Act 105 itself 
												provides in section 75 that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Save as otherwise expressly 
												provided in this Act and any 
												regulation made thereunder, the 
												rules of evidence and the 
												procedure to be observed in 
												proceedings before a service 
												tribunal shall as far as is 
												practicable be the same as those 
												observed in proceedings before a 
												civil court&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Section 98 of the Act defines a 
												&#8220;service tribunal&#8221; as &#8220;a 
												court-martial or a person 
												presiding at a summary trial&#8221; 
												and a &#8220;civil court&#8221; as &#8220;a court 
												of ordinary criminal 
												jurisdiction in Ghana and 
												includes a court of summary 
												jurisdiction&#8221;. These provisions 
												of both Act 30 and Act 105 leave 
												me in no doubt that a trial 
												before a court-martial must be 
												in accordance with the relevant 
												procedures under Act 30. To hold 
												otherwise would lead to a 
												manifest absurdity, for it would 
												mean that the law as to criminal 
												procedure would be different 
												depending on whether the trial 
												comes before a court martial or 
												before the ordinary criminal 
												courts of this country. Act 30 
												sets out two broad procedures &#8211; 
												summary trial and trial on 
												indictment. A summary trial is 
												held before a judge or panel of 
												judges sitting as the 
												adjudicating authority; in a 
												trial on indictment a judge sits 
												with a jury or with assessors. 
												The process before the trial 
												court-martial was a summary 
												trial. In that type of trial the 
												rule requires that the decision 
												to convict the accused must take 
												the form of a reasoned judgment. 
												The rule is in section 177(1) of 
												Act 30.&nbsp; It reads as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The court, having heard what 
												each party has to say and the 
												witnesses and evidence so 
												adduced, shall consider and 
												determine the whole matter and 
												may either convict the accused 
												and pass sentence upon him 
												according to law or acquit him, 
												as the case may be, and the 
												court shall give its decision in 
												the form of an oral judgment and 
												shall record the decision 
												briefly together with reasons 
												for it, where necessary&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What this means is that the 
												trial court must, at least, 
												resolve the facts in issue and 
												give reasons why it prefers the 
												prosecution&#8217;s case to that of 
												the accused. The reasons are 
												necessary unless it is clearly 
												obvious that guilt must be 
												inferred from the facts and 
												circumstances of the case. There 
												are several decisions in our 
												case law. I will start with the 
												case of C.O.P. v. Asamoah (1958) 
												2 WALR. 458. The then Court of 
												Appeal in construing section 173 
												of the Criminal Procedure Code, 
												cap 10 of 1951, which had an 
												identical provisions, held that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The proper interpretation to be 
												attached to section 173 of the 
												Criminal Procedure Code, C 10, 
												which speaks of the reasons for 
												a decision being recorded &#8220;where 
												necessary&#8221;, is that a record is 
												always necessary in the case of 
												a conviction unless the reason 
												for the conviction is clearly 
												obvious and beyond doubt from 
												the facts and circumstances of 
												the case&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The court itself observed that 
												the language of section 173 of 
												the Procedure Code required a 
												magistrate to record reasons for 
												decisions only &#8220;where necessary&#8221; 
												but took the view that reasons 
												are necessary whenever &#8220;there is 
												a conviction unless the reason 
												is so clearly obvious and beyond 
												doubt that guilt can be inferred 
												from the facts and the 
												circumstances of the case &#8220;The 
												Learned Judges reasoned that &#8220;If 
												in any case the reason for a 
												decision is not so obvious to an 
												appellate court then the trial 
												court has erred in not recording 
												its reason. We should remember 
												that what may appear obvious to 
												a magistrate or a judge may not 
												appear to be so to the public. 
												Nobody likes a decision against 
												him, more especially in a 
												criminal matter, if it is given 
												summarily without a reason&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Courts have consistently 
												held that where a case is 
												contested because the accused 
												maintains that he is innocent 
												the court must give reasons for 
												convicting the accused. In 
												construing a similar provision 
												in section 300 of the old 
												Criminal Procedure Code, Cap. 
												10, which required the judge in 
												a trial with the aid of 
												assessors to give a reasoned 
												judgment, the Supreme Court said 
												that the rule is &#8220;well founded 
												in law on the principle that the 
												judicial process is well known 
												to be to resolve the facts in 
												issue and facts relevant to the 
												issue and then apply the law to 
												the facts found. If the question 
												&#8220;what are the facts found?&#8221; 
												cannot be answered with 
												precision and particularity, the 
												judgment ought to be held to be 
												unsatisfactory, because the 
												judicial process has not been 
												applied.&nbsp; A fortiori where the 
												judgment is non-existent, the 
												judicial process has been 
												manifestly ignored as in the 
												present case&#8221;&nbsp; See Mensah and 
												ankrah v. the State, (1961 GLR 
												64, at 67-68).&nbsp; The principle 
												has remained with us up to 
												today.&nbsp; Three recent cases 
												illustrate the point.&nbsp; In the 
												case of Afotey v. The Rep. 
												(1984-86) 1 GLR 475, in a trial 
												for assault the magistrate 
												convicted the appellant in a 
												judgment which read as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Judgment: Prosecution has 
												proved its case beyond all 
												reasonable doubts against the 
												accused is convicted and 
												sentenced to a fine of ¢500.00 
												or six months&#8217; imprisonment&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The accused appealed against the 
												conviction and the High Court 
												allowed the appeal, holding that 
												the trial magistrate ought to 
												have given a more careful and 
												judicious appraisal of the 
												evidence than she appeared to 
												have done. Said the court:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;It is not being advocated that 
												she should have written a 
												literary essay or opinion in 
												arriving at her judgment, which 
												is not her duty; but she could 
												have made findings of fact (very 
												briefly) with brief reasons in 
												support of her verdict. The 
												magistrate court is a court of 
												summary jurisdiction. The 
												magistrate should adjudicate as 
												such, but where cases are 
												heavily contested (as in the 
												instant case), she must be seen 
												to have exercised her powers and 
												discretion judiciously. The 
												terseness of her judgment is 
												admired, only that, it fell 
												little short of what is expected 
												of her.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												See also Mainoo v. Rep&nbsp; 
												(1984-86)2 GLR 727, and Boakye 
												v. Rep Part 1 (1992-93) GLR 
												423.&nbsp; In view of the 
												authorities, I think the 
												judgment of&nbsp; the court-martial 
												was clearly defective.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Let me now turn to the grounds 
												of appeal argued by the 
												appellant&#8217;s counsel. Four 
												grounds were filed but he argued 
												only two, namely, grounds B and 
												E; he told the court he was 
												abandoning grounds A, C and D. 
												His contention in respect of 
												ground B is that the prosecution 
												failed to call material 
												witnesses and therefore failed 
												to establish a case against the 
												appellant. He argued that in the 
												face of such failure to call 
												material witnesses, it was wrong 
												for the Court of Appeal to 
												dismiss the appeal against 
												conviction. This argument will 
												be correct if indeed there were 
												material witnesses which the 
												prosecution did not call in 
												support of the case against the 
												appellant, for the law is 
												settled that the failure means 
												that the case against the 
												appellant was not proved beyond 
												reasonable doubt.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As a general rule the 
												prosecution has the discretion 
												to present such witnesses as it 
												elects to call in support of its 
												case. But the discretion must be 
												exercised in a manner that would 
												further the interests of justice 
												and ensure fairness to the 
												accused so that he does not 
												suffer any disadvantage.&nbsp; [vide, 
												r. v. Oliva (1965)3 All E.R 
												116]. The rule that the 
												prosecution must call material 
												witnesses becomes, therefore, an 
												important qualification on the 
												prosecution&#8217;s discretion. 
												Whether or not a witness is a 
												material witness depends on the 
												quality and content of the 
												evidence he is expected to offer 
												in relation to the case on 
												trial. He will be deemed to be 
												material if the evidence 
												expected from him is deemed to 
												be so vital as to be capable of 
												clearly resolving one way or the 
												other an important and decisive 
												issue of fact that is in 
												controversy. The evidence must 
												appear likely to have a profound 
												impact on the facts of the case 
												to the extent that if it is 
												accepted as true it will compel 
												the court to come to a 
												conclusion that is different 
												from the decision it has taken. 
												Thus, for example, in the case 
												of R. v. Adjenjinah and Anor. 
												(1942)8 WACA 193 a witness was 
												adjudged not to be a material 
												witness because the court was of 
												the view that whatever evidence 
												he would give could not have 
												changed the decision reached by 
												the trial court upon the 
												evidence on record.&nbsp; But in R. 
												v. Ansere (1958) 3 WALR 385, 
												where the evidence expected from 
												the witness was found to be 
												necessary to establish whether 
												or not the accused was the 
												person who took the monies he 
												was alleged to have stolen, the 
												court held that he was a 
												material witness because his 
												evidence would have made clear 
												the accused&#8217;s guilt or 
												innocence; and the prosecution&#8217;s 
												failure to call him meant that 
												they were unable to prove the 
												offence of stealing with which 
												he was charged.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It must also be noted that the 
												prosecutor has the right to 
												decide who his material 
												witnesses are. No law has as yet 
												taken away what Lord Thankerton 
												called &#8220;the long-established 
												right of the prosecutor to 
												exercise his discretion to 
												determine who the material 
												witnesses are&#8221;:&#8212; Adel Muhammed 
												El Dabbah v. A-G Palestine 
												[1944] 2 All E.R. 139 at page 
												144. In the appeal before us the 
												persons referred to by the 
												appellant as material witnesses 
												were the guardsmen on duty that 
												night near the traffic light at 
												the Burma Camp. Counsel has 
												argued that since the trouble 
												arose because of the alleged 
												crossing of the red light by the 
												appellant, the prosecution were 
												bound to call the guards, or at 
												least one of them, to 
												substantiate the allegation that 
												the appellant drove through the 
												traffic light when the red 
												lights were on. He says that 
												evidence would have gone to 
												demonstrate the credibility of 
												the Colonel who was the 
												complainant or would have gone 
												to demonstrate the credibility 
												of the appellant. In his view, 
												if the evidence of the guards 
												show that the appellant did not 
												drive through the red light it 
												would show that the Colonel was 
												not truthful ab initio and 
												therefore went to fabricate the 
												follow-up story that the 
												appellant assaulted him.&nbsp; 
												Accordingly, he submits that the 
												failure by the prosecution to 
												call those guardsmen meant that 
												the prosecution failed to prove 
												the case against the appellant 
												beyond reasonable doubt.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What is the prosecution&#8217;s case? 
												It is in the charges. It is that 
												(1) the appellant struck his 
												superior officer with a blow, 
												and (2) used violence against 
												the officer and (3) resisted 
												arrest and struggled with the 
												arresting officers, &#8212; all of 
												which amounted to conduct 
												prejudicial to good order and 
												discipline. The appellant was 
												not charged with a traffic 
												offence. But that was what the 
												guards allegedly witnessed and 
												could testify to; they knew 
												nothing about what took place in 
												the appellant house between the 
												appellant and the Colonel. The 
												evidence about what happened at 
												the traffic light has no 
												momentous relevance to the 
												offences charged, and to my mind 
												it would not have assisted the 
												trial court in any way in 
												determining the guilt or 
												innocence of the appellant on 
												the offences charged. The 
												guardsmen had nothing to 
												supplement the prosecution&#8217;s 
												case to enable the court make a 
												just and fair decision.&nbsp; In my 
												opinion the guardsmen were not 
												material witnesses and the 
												failure to call them did no harm 
												to the prosecution&#8217;s case. That 
												ground of appeal fails and is 
												accordingly dismissed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The other ground of appeal 
												argued is that the sentence of 
												dismissal is harsh and 
												excessive. He contends that the 
												court-martial was wrong in 
												taking into consideration 
												&#8220;previous offences committed by 
												the accused in respect of which 
												he had already been penalized&#8221;. 
												He argued that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The court-martial erred in law 
												in considering previous offences 
												of the appellant to which he 
												admitted and was penalized and 
												same placed on his service 
												record, in passing sentence on 
												him.&nbsp; This accounts for the 
												harshness of the sentence 
												vis-à-vis the alleged offence 
												and circumstances surrounding 
												them&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel relied on the decision 
												of this court in the case of 
												Afari v. Commissioner of Police 
												(1963) 1 GLR 381.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This submission is clearly 
												misconceived. The decision in 
												the Afari case dealt with a 
												situation that was quite 
												different from the case now 
												before us. It related to 
												punishment in respect of other 
												charges pending against the 
												accused. The law which was 
												applied was section 162 of the 
												Criminal Procedure Code.&nbsp; It 
												reads:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Where an accused person is 
												found guilty of an offence, the 
												court may, in passing sentence, 
												take into consideration any 
												other charge then pending 
												against the accused if the 
												accused admits the other charge 
												and desires it to be taken into 
												consideration and if the 
												prosecutor of the other charge 
												consents&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This provision must be 
												distinguished from the provision 
												in section 300(1) of the same 
												Criminal Procedure Code 
												permitting the court, after 
												convicting the accused, to take 
												into account his previous record 
												of convictions and impose on him 
												an enhanced punishment. This 
												other section of the code reads:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Where a person, having been 
												convicted of crime, is again 
												convicted of crime he shall be 
												liable to increased punishment 
												in the cases and manner provided 
												in the table annexed to this 
												section and the notes thereto 
												&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel for the appellant should 
												have been familiar with the 
												procedure which is very much 
												applied in the courts. The view 
												has long been held that the 
												offender must be punished in a 
												manner that emphasizes society&#8217;s 
												determination to control crime 
												and deter potential offenders. 
												For the recidivist, the law has 
												always provided an enhanced 
												sentence. It is therefore common 
												practice for the court, after 
												convicting the accused, to hear 
												evidence of any previous 
												convictions against him.&nbsp; The 
												court is entitled to take that 
												information into consideration 
												in determining the appropriate 
												punishment to impose in the 
												circumstances of the particular 
												case before it. It is no wonder 
												then that Article 112.50(2) (b) 
												of the Armed Forces Regulations 
												(C.I. 12) also provides that the 
												court martial in determining the 
												severity of punishment shall 
												&#8220;impose a punishment 
												commensurate with the gravity of 
												the offence and the previous 
												character of the offender&#8221;. 
												Besides, the Rules of Procedure 
												(Armed) 1956 of the British Army 
												Act 1955, which is applicable to 
												the Ghana Armed Forces by virtue 
												of Article 112.04 of the Armed 
												Forces Regulations Vol. 11 (C.I. 
												12) also provides in section 7 
												1(b) that the court shall, in 
												their deliberation on the 
												sentence, take evidence 
												including the service record of 
												the accused which shall include 
												&#8220;Particulars of any offence of 
												which the accused has been found 
												guilty during his service and 
												which is recorded in the service 
												book relating to the accused and 
												of the length of time he has 
												been under arrest awaiting trial 
												or in confinement under a 
												current sentence&#8221;. All these 
												several provisions give the 
												court martial power to look at 
												the previous record of the 
												appellant when considering his 
												sentence. It is not open to 
												counsel to attack the court. 
												Since the appellant was a 
												serving soldier the court was 
												right in receiving a statement 
												of the appellant&#8217;s record from a 
												properly accredited officer, 
												&#8220;the Custodian of Service 
												Records&#8221;.&nbsp; See the English case 
												of R. v. Roche&nbsp; 30 Cr. App R. 
												29.&nbsp; But before considering the 
												plea to reduce the sentence it 
												would be necessary to determine 
												the fate of the conviction 
												itself. There will be no need to 
												consider the sentence if the 
												conviction cannot stand. And 
												that takes me back to the 
												judgment of the trial court 
												martial. I quote that judgment 
												again. It reads:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The court finds the accused 
												person guilty on all the 3 
												counts&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As I have pointed out already it 
												seems to me that this is no 
												judgment having regard to the 
												nature of the trial. The 
												authorities indicate that our 
												courts have long been legally 
												wedded to the principle that 
												where a trial court in a summary 
												trial convicts the accused but 
												makes no findings of fact and 
												fails to write a reasoned 
												judgment that failure on the 
												part of the court vitiates the 
												conviction, rendering it liable 
												to be quashed by an appellate 
												court. The courts have not, as 
												yet, seen any ground for divorce 
												from that principle. I always 
												remember Osei-Hwere, J&#8217;s words 
												that &#8220;Criminal convictions 
												cannot be founded on the mere 
												ipse dixit or a trial court&#8221;. 
												Comfort and anor. v Rep&nbsp; (1974) 
												2 GLR 1 at page 5. Such a 
												judgment is often declared a 
												nullity either because the trial 
												judge is said to have erred in 
												law: COP v. Asamoah&nbsp; (1958) 3 
												WALR 458; Comfort and anor. v 
												Rep&nbsp; (1974) 2 GLR 1; or the 
												judgment is said to be 
												unsatisfactory because the court 
												failed to discharge the judicial 
												process; R. Sarpong (1959) GLR 
												383; Comfort and anor. v Rep&nbsp; 
												(1974) 2 GLR; or that the 
												failure is fraught with the 
												danger of injustice: R v Adamu 
												(1960) GLR 91. The judicial 
												process mentioned in the cases 
												is the duty to resolve the facts 
												in issue and facts relevant to 
												the issue and apply the law to 
												the facts. The general trend 
												discernible from the cases is a 
												clear indication that our courts 
												invariably quash such 
												convictions and proceed to 
												acquit and discharge the 
												appellants. Even though an 
												appeal is often said to be by 
												way or re-hearing the courts 
												have not adopted the practice 
												of&nbsp; rehearing this type of 
												cases. The rationale behind this 
												attitude appears to me to be 
												this, that because the courts 
												treat the whole trial as a 
												nullity, they cannot in the same 
												vein look at the proceedings and 
												determine what should have been 
												the correct decision of the 
												trial court. In R v Addae (1959) 
												GLR the trial judge convicted 
												the appellant upon the opinion 
												of the assessors without writing 
												a judgment as required by the 
												Criminal Procedure Code. The 
												conviction was quashed on 
												appeal. Korsah CJ. delivering&nbsp; 
												the judgment of the Court of 
												Appeal said at page 366 and 367:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;In our view, there is evidence 
												on record upon which the Court 
												might reasonably have convicted 
												the appellant of the offence for 
												which he was arraigned before 
												it. We have, however, been 
												obliged to allow the appeal by 
												reason of errors which are 
												apparent on the record, and 
												which vitiate the conviction and 
												sentence imposed on the 
												appellant &#8230;&nbsp; It is clear &#8230; that 
												in a trial by a court with the 
												aid of assessors, where the 
												judge is required to pronounce 
												his verdict irrespective of what 
												the opinions of the assessors 
												may be, the judge must write a 
												judgment stating his reasons for 
												what conclusion he reaches upon 
												the evidence adduced before him.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Court as in all such other 
												cases simply allowed the appeal, 
												set aside the conviction and 
												acquitted and discharged the 
												appellant. See also Bruce v 
												Attorney General (1967) GLR 170; 
												Afotey v Rep (1984-86) 1 GLR 
												475; Rep v Boakye (1992-93) Part 
												1 GBR 423; Mainoo v Rep&nbsp; 
												(1984-86) 2 GLR 727, where&nbsp; 
												Francois, JSC, sitting as an 
												additional High Court Judge, 
												allowed the appeal but ordered a 
												retrial. Of course the decision 
												to order a retrial where a trial 
												has been declared a nullity is 
												always a matter within the 
												discretion of the appellate 
												court having regard to the 
												nature and particular 
												circumstances of each particular 
												case and, above all, the need to 
												do justice. The case before us 
												falls within the class of 
												unsatisfactory trials which the 
												authorities have persistently 
												condemned and disapproved of. In 
												dealing with appeals of this 
												kind we must remind ourselves of 
												the functions of this court. We 
												sit merely as a court of appeal 
												and in that regard our first 
												duty is to find out if a 
												decision has been made by the 
												trial court; then we have to see 
												the evidence which supported the 
												finding made by the trial court; 
												next, if any question of law 
												arises, we have to see whether 
												or not the law has been properly 
												applied. So here, we have to see 
												whether there is a proper 
												judgment as required by our law. 
												In a recent decision by this 
												court in the case of&nbsp; Kwanteng 
												II v Klu (1993-94) 1GLR 280, at 
												284 Adade J.S.C put the matter 
												clearly thus:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;There is however, one aspect of 
												the matter on which I wish to 
												comment, that is the absence 
												from the record of appeal of the 
												reasoned opinion or judgment of 
												the trial judge. It is a serious 
												matter which should not be 
												glossed over lightly.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												When the then Chief Justice&#8217;s 
												attention was drawn to this 
												defect whilst the case was 
												pending on appeal before the 
												Court of Appeal, he directed, 
												administratively, that the&nbsp; case 
												be sent back to the High Court 
												to be heard do novo. Admittedly, 
												the Chief Justice&#8217;s intentions 
												were admirable; unfortunately he 
												tripped on the law, as was 
												pointed out by Lamptey J.A. in 
												his ruling of 18th December 1987 
												in Klu v., Kwanteng[1989-90] 1 
												GLR 135.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												But the impression must on no 
												account be created that because 
												an appeal by way of a rehearing, 
												the reasoned judgment of the 
												trial court is not necessary. In 
												my view, as a rule, that 
												judgment is a always to be seen 
												and read by the judge in the 
												record of appeal that:&nbsp; &#8220;Per 
												court: The plaintiff&#8217;s claim 
												[is] dismissed with costs of 
												¢750 inclusive of ¢500 for 
												counsel&#8221; cannot be a substitute 
												of the reasoned judgment of the 
												court. It is the reasoned 
												judgment which will indicate to 
												the appellate court where the 
												judge went right, or wrong, both 
												on the facts and on the law; and 
												whether the judge discharged the 
												judicial function imposed on 
												him, or whether he failed to do 
												so. That function has been 
												defined as finding the facts and 
												applying the law to the facts. 
												If this function cannot be said 
												to have been adequately 
												performed by the trial judge, an 
												appellate court will in all 
												probability send the case back 
												to the retried, notwithstanding 
												the fact that and appeal is by 
												way of rehearing&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												My conclusion is that our courts 
												have always frowned upon the 
												type of judgment given by the 
												court martial against the 
												appellant in this case, and in 
												my humble opinion it must be 
												given the same type of burial 
												which was solemnly given to its 
												predecessors. I will allow the 
												appeal for the reason that the 
												court martial did not give any 
												judgment. The conviction is 
												accordingly quashed and the 
												appellant acquitted and 
												discharged.&nbsp; </span></p>

												should be allowed; but on 
												slightly different grounds.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This appeal turns on the proper 
												effect of section 177(1) of the 
												Criminal Procedure Code, 1960 
												(Act 30) upon a trial held under 
												that Code.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												My brother Adzoe has assembled 
												almost all the authorities that 
												touch and concern the 
												interpretation of that section. 
												Since he has fully set out that 
												section I need not repeat its 
												provisions here.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The authorities set out by my 
												brother Adzoe, J.S.C. have held 
												that it is imperative to give 
												reasons for a judgment as 
												required by the said section 
												177(1) of Act 30, which is 
												mandatory, unless the reasons 
												for a conviction are clearly 
												obvious and beyond doubt from 
												the facts and circumstances of 
												the case; and where this is not 
												done the conviction cannot 
												stand. In such a case, almost 
												invarably the appellant is 
												acquitted and discharged. &nbsp;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Most of the said authorities, 
												however, related to trial with 
												assessors where failure by the 
												trial judge to write a reasoned 
												judgment, where he agrees with 
												the assessors; might involve 
												abandoning his jurisdiction to 
												the assessors. The rest were 
												determined solely upon the 
												construction of statutory 
												provisions similar to those 
												contained in section 177(1) of 
												Act 30 without regard to 
												provisions of the nature and 
												type contained in sections 406 
												of Act 30 and 31 of the Courts 
												Act, 1993, (Act 459).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Section 406 of Act 30 provides, 
												as far as relevant, as 
												follows:&#8212;&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;406(1) Subject to the 
												provisions hereinafter 
												contained, no finding, sentence, 
												or order passed by a Court of 
												competent jurisdiction shall be 
												reversed or altered on appeal or 
												review on account&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) of any error, omission, or 
												irregularity in the complaint, 
												summons, warrant, charge, 
												proclamation, order, judgment, 
												or other proceedings before or 
												during the trial or in any 
												enquiry or other proceedings 
												under this Code; &#8230;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&nbsp;unless such error, omission, 
												irregularity, or misdirection 
												has in fact occasioned a 
												substantial miscarriage of 
												justice&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Section 31(1) of the Courts Act, 
												1993 (Act 459) similarly 
												provides as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												31(1) subject to subsection (2) 
												of this section an appellate 
												court on hearing any appeal 
												before it in a criminal case 
												shall allow the appeal if it 
												considers that the verdict or 
												conviction or acquittal ought to 
												be set aside on the ground that 
												it is unreasonable or cannot be 
												supported having regard to the 
												evidence or that the judgment in 
												question ought to be set aside 
												on the ground of a wrong 
												decision of any question of law 
												or fact or that on any ground 
												there was a miscarriage of 
												justice and in any other case 
												shall dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) The court shall dismiss the 
												appeal if it considers that no 
												substantial miscarriage of 
												justice has actually occurred or 
												that the point raised in the 
												appeal consists of a 
												technicality or procedural error 
												or a defect in the charge or 
												indictment but that there is 
												evidence to support the offence 
												alleged in the statement of 
												offence in the charge or 
												indictment or any other offence 
												of which the accused could have 
												been convicted upon that charge 
												or indictment&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is clear therefore that 
												section 177(1) of Act 30 ought 
												not to be construed or given 
												effect independently of these 
												provisions. In so far as some of 
												the authorities relied on by 
												brother Adzoe, J.S.C. were 
												subject to statutory provisions 
												similar to those under sections 
												406 of Act 30 and 31 of Act 459, 
												at the time they were decided, I 
												would hold them to have been 
												decided per incuriam of those 
												provisions.&nbsp; Section 177(1) is 
												clearly subject to the 
												provisions of sections 406 of 
												Act 30 and 31 of Act 459.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The effect of those saving 
												provisions has been judicially 
												determined in Ghana and in 
												England, under similar 
												provisions. The construction 
												placed on them is that if the 
												jury (or court), properly 
												directed, would have inevitably 
												or without doubt convicted the 
												accused, then the proviso to 
												those provisions would validate 
												the conviction and an appeal 
												therefrom would be dismissed.

												I would therefore hold that an

												judgment under section 177(1) of 
												Act 30 is not fatal, not only 
												when the reason for the decision 
												(whether acquittal or 
												conviction) is clearly obvious 
												and beyond doubt but also where 
												the decision or judgment 
												appealed from is supported by 
												evidence of such a nature that, 
												if the trial court, had directed 
												itself properly on the 
												provisions of section 177(1) of

												judgment; it would have 
												inevitably or without doubt have 
												convicted the appellant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In my view, the failure to make 
												findings of fact and write a 
												reasoned judgment under section 
												177(1) of Act 30 does not render 
												the proceedings a nullity as 
												held, with the greatest respect, 
												in MAINOO V. THE REPUBLIC (1984 
												&#8211; 86) 2 GLR 727.&nbsp; It is 
												difficult to see how the failure 
												to write a reasoned judgment, 
												where necessary, should infect a 
												proper charge sheet, properly 
												admitted evidence, etc; all with 
												a nullity. In my view such a 
												judgment is only unsatisfactory 
												and, inter alia, an appellate 
												court is entitled to make up its 
												own mind on the facts and come 
												to a conclusion of its own, see 
												ASARE V. DONKOR (1962) GLR 176

												(1967) GLR 170 at 187 and ASANTE

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As regards the failure to 
												convict before passing a 
												sentence, I would hoId that such 
												an omission is a mere curable 
												technicality, where an intent to 
												convict for the charge or 
												charges is clear on the record,

												&nbsp;I must confess that at first I

												inevitably or without doubt, as 
												a reasonable jury (for that is 
												what a court sitting alone, also
