                                              claims to the ownership of a 
                                              parcel of land was pending before 
                                              the court. The plaintiff by his 
                                              solicitor had filed a summons for 
                                              directions in which he had set out 
                                              all the major controverted issues, 
                                              as in fact should, with respect, 
                                              be expected by any practitioner 
                                              familiar with drawing up of issues

                                              rather senior legal practitioner 
                                              took objection not on any of the 
                                              usual grounds, e.g. not pleaded; 
                                              conducive to futile result; 
                                              irrelevant, etc. but on the 
                                              pretext that all the major issues 
                                              calling for specific findings of 
                                              fact should be reduced into a 
                                              single issue, to wit, whether or 
                                              not the land was owned by the 
                                              plaintiff or by the defendant.

                                              To this writer's mind, a greater 
                                              invitation to repeated 
                                              miscarriages of justice one could 
                                              never contemplate! That objection 
                                              underscored the disturbing fact 
                                              that even at the highest reaches 
                                              of the profession, there must be 
                                              some who are still at a loss as to 
                                              the place and indispensable 
                                              importance of the stage for 
                                              summons for directions in a civil 
                                              action. To be frank, most of us 
                                              thought little of the importance 
                                              of that stage when we were young 
                                              practitioners. But with the 
                                              advantage of maturity we are now 
                                              in a position to assert without 
                                              any trepidation that the stage for 
                                              summons for directions is the most 
                                              crucial one in the civil trial 
                                              next to the skill of opposing 
                                              counsel, the intelligence and 
                                              clarity of the witnesses and the 
                                              foibles, fairness and competence 
                                              of the trial judge! </span></p>

                                              The scant regard which most 
                                              practitioners cherish for that 
                                              stage is shown by the fact that

                                              summons for directions are served,

                                              or lose their clients' case 
                                              through the content, omissions or

                                              It is common place that the issues 
                                              for trial form the first part of 
                                              the summons after the invitation 
                                              to attend the court or judge, and 
                                              the second part is taken up by the 
                                              orders which the court is required 
                                              to make to further the trial. The 
                                              orders segment sub-divides into: 
                                              (a) call for an early trial and 
                                              (b) a statement of the probable 
                                              number of days the trial would 
                                              occupy and (c) the kind of orders 
                                              for costs to be agreed upon before 
                                              the hearing—whether the costs 
                                              should be in the cause with 
                                              liberty to apply or costs in any

                                              (1) It helps a trial judge to do

                                              which he might have been impelled 
                                              to base his judgment. Asking 
                                              himself whether he was really 
                                              called upon to decide a point that 
                                              forces itself on his mind would

                                              would denote either a veiled bias

                                              S.C. that a court must not

                                              acknowledged the correctness of

                                              been left unassisted, for in such 
                                              an instance, he could deal only 
                                              with questions put before him 
                                              according to the best of his own 
                                              inclinations. He might humanly 
                                              have an oversight of one or more 
                                              issues which might have exercised 
                                              the parties most. But the human 
                                              tendency towards oversights would 
                                              be minimised if the statement of 
                                              the issues were sufficiently and 
                                              clearly set out for the guidance 
                                              of all! </span></p>
