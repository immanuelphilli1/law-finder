                                              THE recent Court of Appeal 
                                              decision in Boateng v. Dwinfuor1 
                                              raises two important questions: 
                                              (a) what is the relevance in our 
                                              deeds registration system of those 
                                              provisions of the Conveyancing 
                                              Decree, 1973 (N.R.C.D. 175), 
                                              dealing with the recording of oral 
                                              disposition of interests in land? 
                                              and (b) does the Land Registry 
                                              Act, 1962 (Act 122), allow for the 
                                              operation of the rules concerning 
                                              priority between competing or 
                                              conflicting instruments affecting 
                                              the same land?</span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
                                              <span style="font-family: Arial">
                                              It is one of the key objectives of 
                                              this note to subject these 
                                              questions to examination so as to 
                                              demonstrate, firstly that a 
                                              perspicacious analysis, of the 
                                              relevant laws would disclose that 
                                              the Conveyancing Decree. 1973,2 
                                              was designed to supplement the 
                                              provisions of the Land Registry 
                                              Act, 1962, and that its provisions 
                                              ought not to be ignored in the 
                                              determination of issues concerning 
                                              land registration. Secondly, it is 
                                              intended to show that priority 
                                              between competing instruments 
                                              cannot feature prominently under 
                                              the Land Registry Act, 1962. But 
                                              before examining these questions 
                                              in some detail, the facts of the 
                                              decision in Boateng v. Dwinfuor 
                                              should be stated.</span></p>

                                              In this case, the plaintiff 
                                              claimed to have bought a house 
                                              situate at Bekwai, from its owner 
                                              for her personal occupation and 
                                              later got the title deeds 
                                              registered. She sought an order of 
                                              possession and ejectment against 
                                              the defendant who according to the 
                                              plaintiff’s own evidence was 
                                              living in the house at the time of 
                                              the alleged purchase of the house. 
                                              The defendant’s case on the other 
                                              hand was that in 1970, that is, 
                                              four years before the plaintiff's 
                                              alleged purchase, he had concluded 
                                              an oral tenancy agreement with the 
                                              owner through his agent in Bekwai. 
                                              Under this verbal agreement, the 
                                              defendant was obliged to repair at 
                                              his own expense, the then 
                                              dilapidated house of the owner and 
                                              to convert it into a tenantable 
                                              house suitable for a clinic. The 
                                              monthly payable rent was fixed at 
                                              ¢14 and the tenancy was of an 
                                              indefinite duration. The defendant 
                                              was to recover his initial 
                                              expenses on repairs from accruing 
                                              rent. The defendant claimed that 
                                              he had fulfilled his part of the 
                                              contract and had entered into 
                                              possession.</span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
                                              <span style="font-family: Arial">
                                              On these facts, the defendant 
                                              resisted the present action on 
                                              several grounds, one of which was 
                                              that the tenancy agreement orally 
                                              concluded between the original 
                                              owner of the house and himself was 
                                              binding on the former, his 
                                              assignees, alienees or successors 
                                              in title. Considering the question 
                                              whether or not the verbal tenancy

                                              Ga-Adangbe where the paramount

                                              to be in writing. Thus any

                                              writing signed by the person

                                              within the class of exceptions 
                                              specified under section 3 of the 
                                              Decree10. It is also provided that 
                                              a transfer of an interest in land 
                                              made in a manner other than as 
                                              provided under the Part I of the 
                                              Decree shall not confer any title 
                                              on the transferee11. This in 
                                              effect, means that the requirement 
                                              of writing is now a condition 
                                              without which no land transaction 
                                              can be valid in the country.12</span></p>

                                              writing is directed is the making

                                              above, therefore, have the 
                                              important effect of filling in the 
                                              gap left by the Land Registry Act, 
                                              1962, namely, that it does not 
                                              provide for the registration of 
                                              oral dealings in land.</span></p>

                                              Since the Decree says that oral 
                                              transactions shall not be 
                                              ineffective until recorded in the 
                                              manner outlined above, the Court 
                                              of Appeal should have considered 
                                              the validity of the verbal tenancy 
                                              agreement between the original 
                                              landlord and the defendant in 
                                              Boateng v. Dwinfuor. Perhaps, as 
                                              the agreement was concluded in 
                                              1970, four years before the coming 
                                              into force of the Decree, the 
                                              transaction could be said to fall 
                                              outside the ambit of the Decree.15 
                                              But this is not a good reason why 
                                              the Court of Appeal should ignore 
                                              and fail to consider the effect of 
                                              the relevant provisions of the 
                                              Decree so as to clarify an issue 
                                              which is a relevant question of

                                              The way in which the Court of

                                              section 36 of the Land Registry 
                                              Act, 1962, in Boateng v. Dwinfuor 
                                              creates the impression that under

                                              law so far discussed, such an 
                                              impression would be a travesty of 
                                              the current true position. It is 
                                              not being suggested that the

                                              a land registration system like

                                              Act, 1962, priority between 
                                              conflicting instruments should not 
                                              feature prominently as it is a 
                                              condition for accepting 
                                              instruments for registration that 
                                              they should be accompanied by

                                              to which they relate. Provided 
                                              there is an efficient method of

                                              the Act does not appear to

                                              question which readily comes to 
                                              mind is whether one can 
                                              meaningfully talk of priority 
                                              between competing instruments in 
                                              the light of the way in which the 
                                              system of registration is designed 
                                              to work in practice? Considering 
                                              section 25 of the Act under which 
                                              it is provided that registration 
                                              constitutes notice to the whole 
                                              world, and its effect on the

                                              instruments is not expected to 
                                              play an important role in the 
                                              registration system under the Act.</span></p>

                                              Section 24 of the Act says that an

                                              The case of Ussher v. Darko21. and 
                                              to some extent, the case of Ntem 
                                              v. Ankwandah,22 have created some 
                                              doubts as to the meaning of 
                                              section 24. The two cases create 
                                              doubts as to whether an 
                                              unregistered instrument is or is 
                                              not void. If it is void, then 
                                              there will be nothing by way of an 
                                              instrument to consider. If on the 
                                              other hand it is not void, then 
                                              although it is ineffective, the 
                                              document can operate to confer 
                                              rights under certain 
                                              circumstances. This is what the 
                                              two cases seem to be saying.</span></p>

                                              But one fact is clear from the 
                                              reading of section 24 of Act 122: 
                                              It is this, that an unregistered 
                                              instrument is ineffective until 
                                              registered, which means that no 
                                              legal consequences can flow from 
                                              it. It follows that one can only 
                                              consider priority between two or 
                                              more conflicting instruments which 
                                              have been registered. Such a 
                                              situation may arise where for 
                                              example, one registered instrument 
                                              takes effect from the date of its 
                                              registration while the other takes 
                                              effect retroactively from the date 
                                              of execution as a result of the 
                                              grantee having presented his 
                                              instrument for registration within 
                                              the specified period.</span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

                                              But is this sort of situation 
                                              possible within the meaning of the 
                                              Act? It would appear that it is 
                                              not. Section 25 of the Act says 
                                              that the registration of any 
                                              instrument shall be deemed to 
                                              constitute actual notice of the 
                                              instrument and of the fact of 
                                              registration to all persons and 
                                              for all purposes as from the date 
                                              of registration. The language of 
                                              this provision is clear. It means 
                                              that as from the date of 
                                              registration, no subsequent 
                                              purchaser of the same interest 
                                              relating to the same land can 
                                              claim that he is a bona fide 
                                              purchaser of the interest for 
                                              valuable consideration without 
                                              notice of the prior registration. 
                                              Moreover, by section 24 of the 
                                              Act, as soon as the instrument is 
                                              registered, it becomes effective 
                                              to divest the grantor of his 
                                              interest.</span></p>

                                              <span style="font-family: Arial">
                                              If these arguments are valid, then 
                                              it would appear that there can be 
                                              no case in which the courts will 
                                              be called upon to determine 
                                              priority between two valid 
                                              conflicting instruments. For the 
                                              registration of the first 
                                              instrument will have the effect of 
                                              serving notice to the subsequent 
                                              grantee and at the same time 
                                              divest the grantor of his 
                                              interest. It is agreed, as was 
                                              seen in Amefinu v. Odametey,23 
                                              that an otherwise perfectly 
                                              binding transaction might be 
                                              concluded in respect of a piece of 
                                              land, but until it is registered, 
                                              it would not have the effect of 
                                              divesting the grantor of his 
                                              interest. This means that the 
                                              grantor can conclude other 
                                              transactions in respect of the 
                                              same land with subsequent 
                                              transferees. This shows that there 
                                              can be one or more competing 
                                              instruments. But for the purposes 
                                              of the Act, none of these is valid 
                                              until registered. It follows that

                                              One of the transferees in such a 
                                              case may proceed to register his 
                                              instrument. But as soon as he does 
                                              so the interest in the land vests 
                                              in him. The others could be deemed 
                                              to have actual notice of the 
                                              registered instrument. The grantor 
                                              could be divested of his interest 
                                              and the others would be holding no 
                                              valid instrument within the 
                                              meaning of the Act so as to 
                                              compete with the registered 
                                              instrument. Moreover, as pointed 
                                              out earlier, provided plans 
                                              annexed to registrable instruments 
                                              are accurate and provided that 
                                              there is an efficient system of 
                                              checking such plans against base 
                                              maps drawn to acceptable scales, 
                                              barring human errors, the 
                                              possibility of registering two 
                                              conflicting instruments should be 
                                              very rare indeed. Even in these 
                                              cases where conflicting 
                                              instruments are registered in 
                                              error, in principle, only the 
                                              first one can be valid for the 
                                              purposes of the Act, since as it 
                                              has been pointed out earlier, the 
                                              first registration would have 
                                              divested the grantor of his 
                                              interest rendering the later 
                                              unregistered instrument worthless.</span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

                                              It follows that the only way by 
                                              which two valid competing 
                                              instruments can exist under the 
                                              Act is where both are registered 
                                              at the same time. Since the 
                                              possibility of such a situation 
                                              arising is obviously unlikely, 
                                              there would seem to be no 
                                              justification for the emphasis 
                                              placed on priority between 
                                              competing instruments by the 
                                              courts and text writers. It seems 
                                              that it would be a good policy for 
                                              the courts to ignore unregistered 
                                              instruments and treat them as 
                                              invalid in accordance with the 
                                              provisions of the Act, and 
                                              therefore as if they do not exist 
                                              at all. The courts can then 
                                              proceed from that position to 
                                              consider only registered 
                                              instruments on their own merits. 
                                              The pursuit of such a policy might 
                                              cause occasional injustice to 
                                              persons in the Ussher v. Darko and 
                                              Ntem v. Ankwandah situations, but 
                                              not for long. Such occasional 
                                              injustice to individuals will be 
                                              the price to be paid for “giving 
                                              teeth” to the Land Registry Act 
                                              and making titles certain through 
                                              the application of its 
                                              provisions24. When the ultimate 
                                              goal of general security of title 
                                              has been achieved, such 
                                              unfortunate situations will be 
                                              eliminated altogether25.</span></p>
