                                              The late and much lamented Edward 
                                              Akufo-Addo combined in himself 
                                              many of the qualities one would 
                                              wish to see in a mortal. It is not 
                                              easy to put him in one compartment 
                                              and attach a label to him. He was 
                                              a teacher, scholar, politician, 
                                              father, lawyer, judge and 
                                              statesman. One would have wished 
                                              that he were spared to remain on 
                                              this earth longer. But providence 
                                              wished otherwise. But he lived a 
                                              full life and long enough to leave 
                                              an indelible mark on this planet, 
                                              and he indeed left the world 
                                              better than he found it.</span></p>

                                              When he departed this life on 17 
                                              July 1979 he enjoyed his biblical 
                                              span of life—the three score and 
                                              ten years. Indeed having been born 
                                              in 1906, he exceeded his allotted 
                                              span by three years. To say this 
                                              is not to show lack of regret at

                                              of blessed memory, was imprisoned 
                                              for his activities in that field. 
                                              For two years, that is 1950 and 
                                              1951, he was a member of the 
                                              Legislative Council. Although it 
                                              was for a short spell, I cannot 
                                              doubt that with his great debating 
                                              skill and gift of language, he 
                                              would have excelled in that area 
                                              of activity. The one great 
                                              constitutional commission that can 
                                              be said to be the forerunner of 
                                              our independence, was the Coussey 
                                              Commission for Constitutional 
                                              Reforms. He was thought fit to be 
                                              appointed to the membership of 
                                              that commission. And to it, he 
                                              ungrudgingly gave his services.</span></p>

                                              But the one area of his life about 
                                              which I can speak with a modicum 
                                              of authority, is the law. To say 
                                              that he was one of the greatest 
                                              advocates of his time, will be 
                                              nothing like exaggeration. His 
                                              eloquence and quickness of 
                                              perception, marked him out early 
                                              in his legal career as a force to 
                                              reckon with. That he made a real 
                                              success of forensic practice at 
                                              the Bar, is common knowledge. One 
                                              can recall him, locked in serious 
                                              legal argument with the legal 
                                              giants of his day, the Bossmans, 
                                              Hayfron-Benjamins, Asafu-Adjayes 
                                              all of whom, unfortunately, are no 
                                              more and Mr. Ollennu who is still, 
                                              happily, with us. It was 
                                              impossible to resist the feeling 
                                              that these were men of learning 
                                              and the expression &quot;my learned 
                                              friend&quot; by which, in the tradition 
                                              of the profession, they addressed 
                                              each other, was no empty epithet.</span></p>

                                              For a lawyer of his calibre, 
                                              elevation to the Bench was a 
                                              matter of course. To most lawyers, 
                                              that is the culmination of a 
                                              successful legal career. It came 
                                              in 1962 after he was in the law 
                                              for 22 years, having been called 
                                              to the Bar in 1940. Such honour 
                                              was deserved much earlier. That it 
                                              did not come to him quicker, 
                                              cannot be explained by want of 
                                              merit but by the political 
                                              alignment of the day. But when it 
                                              did arrive, its undue delay was 
                                              acknowledged because he made 
                                              history by being appointed 
                                              together with Lawyer R. S. Blay to 
                                              the then highest court of the land 
                                              namely, the Supreme Court, 
                                              by-passing the High Court in the 
                                              process. He was not destined to 
                                              remain long in that court because 
                                              ironical as it seems, one of the 
                                              treasured qualities of a judge 
                                              which he possessed and exhibited, 
                                              became his undoing. He had the 
                                              courage of his conviction and 
                                              spoke his mind firmly in a 
                                              judicial decision which displeased 
                                              the then power in the land. He was 
                                              dismissed in February, 1964, 
                                              having been on the Bench for less 
                                              than two years. But merit, like 
                                              cork, never remains submerged. 
                                              Just over two years afterwards, he 
                                              was returned to the Bench to fill 
                                              its highest office—Chief Justice.</span></p>

                                              He remained in that office till 
                                              August 1970 when he was invited to 
                                              occupy a still higher office—the 
                                              Presidency of Ghana.</span></p>

                                              On the whole, he occupied high 
                                              judicial office for just over five 
                                              years and did so with great 
                                              distinction. He was the very 
                                              embodiment of the common law. He 
                                              had a firm grasp of principle and 
                                              delighted in legal argument. He 
                                              enjoyed analysing the customary 
                                              law in depth and his quick 
                                              discerning mind enabled him to 
                                              reject such parts of it as were 
                                              out of keeping with modern notions 
                                              of justice. My impression is that 
                                              the time he enjoyed most on the 
                                              Bench, was sitting in the Court of 
                                              Appeal on the civil side 
                                              presumably, because of the variety 
                                              of cases on every subject and the 
                                              companionship of minds as quick 
                                              and alert as his own. His 
                                              judgments were scholarly and 
                                              well-reasoned and couched in a 
                                              felicity of language which few of 
                                              his fellow judges can hardly hope 
                                              to equal. In criminal cases, he 
                                              would stand no nonsense from 
                                              anyone. His firm features showed 
                                              the character of the man who would 
                                              uphold the law. As they say, he 
                                              would &quot;clear the innocent and 
                                              convict and punish the guilty.&quot; 
                                              All respected him. Some feared 
                                              him. But none dare scorn him.</span></p>

                                              While on the Bench, he found time 
                                              to chair the Constitutional

                                              moving spirit behind the 1969 
                                              Constitution. One eternal debt

                                              that branch of government. It is 
                                              largely preserved in the 1979

                                              sometimes comes slowly but it is a 
                                              matter of some pride to his 
                                              judicial colleagues, that some of 
                                              these came while he was Chief 
                                              Justice. In 1968, he was awarded

                                              of the Order of the Volta.

                                              As a person, the late Akufo-Addo 
                                              was as charming as one could wish. 
                                              Respect for principles and strict 
                                              adherence to them, did not 
                                              entirely endear him to everyone. 
                                              Some dubbed him as a snub. He 
                                              certainly was not. True, he had no 
                                              truck with &quot;cheats and frauds.&quot; He 
                                              can be stern when it comes to 
                                              handing down punishment. But he 
                                              was, by no means, cruel. Some 
                                              accused him of arrogance and 
                                              intolerance of other people's 
                                              views. The charge is unjust. I 
                                              accept that he was a militant 
                                              crusader of what he believed to be 
                                              right but he was always open to 
                                              persuasion. There were many 
                                              occasions in my experience when he 
                                              took counsel with his junior 
                                              colleagues and confessed to being 
                                              persuaded by them. But I concede 
                                              that anyone who wishes to convert 
                                              him to his point of view must do 
                                              so by superior reasoning. And it 
                                              is not often that he can be 
                                              outargued.</span></p>

                                              Some of us were privileged to see 
                                              the other part of his life—at home 
                                              with his wife whom he adored and 
                                              his darling children. Their 
                                              welfare was his dearest concern. 
                                              At the Bar, he was excellent 
                                              company, telling stories in zest 
                                              and showing his expert knowledge 
                                              of various brands of champagne, 
                                              the stockpiling and consumption of 
                                              which were, in his days, the 
                                              hall-mark of a successful legal 
                                              practitioner. He was ever 
                                              thoughtful of others, helping 
                                              those in need, sharing their joys 
                                              and troubles especially his junior 
                                              colleagues. Some think it strange 
                                              how one who was stern in the 
                                              public estimation should kindle 
                                              such affection in those close to 
                                              him. But he did so.</span></p>

                                              Although lawyers are not, as a 
                                              class profligates, moral rectitude 
                                              is not one of their strong points. 
                                              While I do not suggest that the 
                                              late Akufo-Addo was other than 
                                              human, he led the moral life which 
                                              many of his colleagues 
                                              unsuccessfully tried to emulate. 
                                              He was the very embodiment of 
                                              disciplined moral living. Part of 
                                              the credit for his moral 
                                              uprightness and exemplary married 
                                              life can be attributed to the 
                                              docility of his early Presbyterian 
                                              upbringing. He was raised at the 
                                              Theological Seminary at Akropong. 
                                              While I believe what he imbibed 
                                              there in his formative years 
                                              influenced his adult life, I think 
                                              he was innately upright. It is an 
                                              irony of fate that he should have 
                                              departed this life when our 
                                              society is undergoing a somewhat 
                                              violent transformation, the stated 
                                              rationale of which is said to be 
                                              moral revolution. If he had lived, 
                                              he would not have grudged us his 
                                              opinion as to which of today's 
                                              goings-on he approves and which he 
                                              disapproves.</span></p>

                                              Having devoted a substantial part 
                                              of his life to public service, it 
                                              was not surprising that he should 
                                              have been asked by his countrymen 
                                              to fill the post of the highest 
                                              honour. On 31 August 1970, he was 
                                              elected President of the Second 
                                              Republic of Ghana. In view of his 
                                              background and training, his 
                                              talents and achievements, he was 
                                              peculiarly fitted for that office, 
                                              not least by the fact that he 
                                              fathered the Constitution under 
                                              which he was elected. But as 
                                              ill-luck would have it, not long 
                                              after his assumption of office, 
                                              his otherwise robust health began 
                                              to fail and he was in and out of 
                                              hospital by turns. Fortunately, he 
                                              was restored to health and as he 
                                              braced himself to command, so to 
                                              speak, the ship of state and 
                                              hopefully, nurture and sustain 
                                              what, to us, is that elusive

                                              government, the event of 13 
                                              January 1972 occurred. I do not 
                                              have to describe it. It is old

                                              He would have been less than human 
                                              if he were not distressed by that 
                                              event. But as was his habit, he

                                              and regarded it as a national

                                              setback. When I called on him 
                                              shortly after 13 January 1972, he 
                                              asked the question &quot;Do you think 
                                              there is any future for an 
                                              elective office in this country?&quot; 
                                              I answered instinctively and 
                                              without reflection &quot;Yes, sure.&quot; I 
                                              did so as an optimist. The events 
                                              since 4 June 1979 in which 
                                              democratic elections were allowed 
                                              to proceed on schedule and the

                                              sense of personal loss. But to his 
                                              family—the closely knit and united 
                                              family that I know it to be, the 
                                              sense of personal loss will be 
                                              greater still. There are however 
                                              two matters from which we can draw 
                                              comfort. First, although 
                                              Akufo-Addo is no more, he cannot 
                                              be forgotten. In two important 
                                              spheres of our national life, he 
                                              has immortalised himself. It will 
                                              remain forever in our records that 
                                              for four years between September 
                                              1966 and August 1970, he headed, 
                                              with great distinction, the 
                                              judicial arm of government and 
                                              from 1970 to 1972, he became the 
                                              Head of State itself. It is an 
                                              achievement which many would 
                                              aspire to but which only few can 
                                              ever attain. There is also the 
                                              fact, comforting in itself, that 
                                              of the two male children he left 
                                              behind, one has chosen his 
                                              profession and if present 
                                              indications are any guide, will 
                                              not only keep ablaze the family 
                                              name and honour, but may leave 
                                              behind a reputation no less 
                                              enviable than his father.</span></p>

                                              We would advise that they should 
                                              not grieve too much. Akufo-Addo 
                                              himself would not wish that. What 
                                              I believe he would wish, is that 
                                              we should think of him sometimes 
                                              and spare an occasional prayer for 
                                              him. But as a patriot and a 
                                              nationalist, I believe his 
                                              greatest wish would be that this 
                                              country should enjoy peace and 
                                              prosperity and that the 
                                              regrettable interruptions in the 
                                              governance of Ghana, should remain 
                                              things of the past. For the legal 
                                              profession, I am certain his wish 
                                              would be that they should continue 
                                              in the future, as in the past, to 
                                              be leaders of thought and should 
                                              continue boldy and fearlessly to 
                                              stand up for what is right and be

                                              Historical truths, to be sure, are 
                                              rarely the object of unanimity. 
                                              Recollections differ, opinions 
                                              differ, even the same facts appear 
                                              different to different people. 
                                              Edward Akufo-Addo's own role will 
                                              be recalled in wholly different

                                              his qualities of mind were most 
                                              memorable. To the politicians, he 
                                              was first and last a politician.

                                              are recalled by his colleagues,

                                              Some are wont to speak more of his 
                                              style than of his substance. In my 
                                              view, this is regrettable, for in 
                                              that short human frame that Edward 
                                              Akufo-Addo carried, he showed 
                                              boundless courage and adherence to 
                                              principle.</span></p>

                                              The Akufo-Addo style was 
                                              special—the grace, the wit, the 
                                              elegance that will rightly long be 
                                              remembered. But what mattered most 
                                              to him, and what in my opinion 
                                              will matter most to history, is 
                                              the substance—the strength of his 
                                              ideas and ideals, his courage and 
                                              judgment. Those were the pith and 
                                              purpose of his judicature and 
                                              presidency of which style was but 
                                              an overtone. No one would want to 
                                              diminish the value of his 
                                              judgments and speeches. But their 
                                              significance lay not in the 
                                              splendour of their rhetoric but in 
                                              the principles and policies they 
                                              conveyed.</span></p>

                                              mistook his refusal to display 
                                              emotion as a lack of concern or

                                              environment of Ghanaian politics. 
                                              For a junior barrister to watch 
                                              his performance in court was to 
                                              see dramatised in real life the 
                                              stuff of the textbooks on 
                                              advocacy. I was myself privileged 
                                              to see him perform in the High 
                                              Court but more often in the 
                                              pre-1969 Supreme Court on appeal. 
                                              The last case I saw him 
                                              argue—against the late K. 
                                              Bentsi-Enchill was the Amarh 
                                              Kwantreng Trust case.1 It was a 
                                              treat to see those two great 
                                              lawyers at it knacking pure equity 
                                              law. It is difficult to single out 
                                              Edward Akufo-Addo's forensic 
                                              qualities; all his formidable 
                                              array of legal weapons were 
                                              deployed: the painstaking 
                                              preparation, ready familiarity 
                                              with the relevant authorities, the 
                                              hard-hitting logic of the 
                                              argument, the mastery of English, 
                                              the concise presentation of the 
                                              case, the frank admission of 
                                              insuperable difficulties and 
                                              flashes of humour to tide him over 
                                              the rougher passages when 
                                              answering probing questions from 
                                              the Bench. And all of it done with 
                                              such manners, such polish! He 
                                              always fought hard and always 
                                              fought clean. And always he strove 
                                              to be the best in professional 
                                              standing and in social grace 
                                              alike. He was a great model to 
                                              copy and emulate.</span></p>

                                              It will be remembered that Edward 
                                              Akufo-Addo thrived in an 
                                              environment which produced such 
                                              legal giants as Nii Amaa Ollennu, 
                                              Sir Edward Asafu-Adjaye, C. F. 
                                              Hayfron-Benjamin Snr., R. S. Blay 
                                              and K. Adumua-Bossman to mention 
                                              only his immediate peers. Of all 
                                              these, only Nii Amaa Ollennu is 
                                              still, happily, with us. These 
                                              were men of many parts well known 
                                              in the political, cultural and 
                                              traditional as well as the 
                                              religious life of the community.&nbsp; 
                                              But these distinctions and 
                                              eminence never put them out of 
                                              range or out of concern for junior 
                                              barristers. To be sure, Edward 
                                              Akufo-Addo was so formidable a 
                                              character from his exacting, high 
                                              standards that a junior normally 
                                              approached him with trepidation. 
                                              But every such junior would 
                                              testify how he was immediately put 
                                              at his ease and given ready 
                                              assistance by that formidable 
                                              cigar-smoking senior. Not many 
                                              lawyers know another endearing 
                                              trait of Edward Akufo-Addo. He 
                                              would walk up to a junior and seek 
                                              his legal opinion on some matter 
                                              in the most disarmingly casual 
                                              manner. It ought also to be 
                                              remembered that he often stopped 
                                              to congratulate a junior who had 
                                              stood up well in court or carried 
                                              off a good argument. And he never 
                                              lacked for words of encouragement 
                                              for a junior who had fought hard 
                                              but failed.</span></p>

                                              The man was surprisingly without 
                                              rancour in his relations with 
                                              opposing counsel or perhaps he was 
                                              much too well-mannered to permit 
                                              himself any outward show of a 
                                              grudge against a fellow lawyer. 
                                              The Ghana Bar Association may 
                                              recall now with an ironical smile 
                                              that Edward Akufo-Addo though 
                                              formerly the Secretary of the Bar 
                                              was the one Chief Justice whom it 
                                              has ever sued in court.2 Though 
                                              the experience must have hurt and 
                                              angered him, yet nevertheless he 
                                              never afterwards held that episode 
                                              against the Bar nor against the 
                                              individual lawyers who fought him 
                                              in court. In this I submit that he 
                                              scored very high marks indeed. It 
                                              is a matter of regret that these 
                                              traits he displayed at the Bar and 
                                              also on the Bench have not, as 
                                              they ought, become matters of 
                                              course among the lawyers of today.</span></p>

                                              I beg leave to mention three 
                                              judgments which prove beyond doubt 
                                              his eminence as a judge though of 
                                              rather short-lived tenure. The 
                                              first is the now oft-cited case of 
                                              Mosi v. Bagyina.3 This was the 
                                              case which decided that a court or 
                                              judge had the inherent power 
                                              without time limit, on his own 
                                              motion or upon a party's 
                                              application to set aside in the 
                                              interest of justice any judgment 
                                              or order which is void because it 
                                              was given without jurisdiction. 
                                              The second case is the judgment in 
                                              the treason trial of Tawiah 
                                              Adamafio and others reported as 
                                              State v. Otchere.4 That 
                                              electrifying judgment acquitting 
                                              and discharging the accused 
                                              persons put it beyond doubt that 
                                              moral courage had not yet left our 
                                              courts when most people thought it 
                                              had. It was this judgment which 
                                              impelled a frustrated President 
                                              Nkrumah into one of his many 
                                              lapses—this time, the forced 
                                              retirement of the deciding judges 
                                              and uninvolved judges who agreed
