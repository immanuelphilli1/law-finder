                                              A.F.R.C.D. 23 and sentenced to a

                                              respect of two offences arising

                                              inquiry into the affairs of the 
                                              Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board, 
                                              popularly known as the “Archer 
                                              Committee.” The two offences were: 
                                              (i) obtaining an advantage by 
                                              using his official position in the

                                              economy of Ghana. An application

                                              on the grounds of (a) lack of

                                              jurisdiction and (c) error of law

                                              the tribunal admitted inadmissible

                                              In short, put in a straightforward 
                                              and simple language the objection 
                                              was that the jurisdiction of the 
                                              High Court to supervise inferior 
                                              tribunals conferred on it by 
                                              article 126 of the Constitution 
                                              does not apply to the special 
                                              tribunal or so far as the special 
                                              tribunal is concerned the 
                                              jurisdiction of the High Court was 
                                              and is ousted. This objection, no 
                                              doubt, tasked the patience of 
                                              Taylor J. and he summarily 
                                              dismissed it with a promise to 
                                              embody his reasons in his ruling. 
                                              And for this he really went to 
                                              town! He even looked at the Year 
                                              Books for judicial inspiration. 
                                              But was it all necessary? For my 
                                              part I think not!</span></p>

                                              In 1957 the Court of Appeal in the

                                              lengthy ruling is that there are 
                                              two types of ouster clauses: The 
                                              first type only confers exclusive 
                                              jurisdiction on an inferior 
                                              tribunal or body of persons as was 
                                              done in section 88 of the Courts

                                              (Act 372)). This I may call

                                              goes further and bars the High

                                              exclusive jurisdiction. Taylor J. 
                                              was dealing with the second type

                                              before them. Where this assistance 
                                              is not forthcoming, they should be 
                                              wary on embarking upon a research 
                                              or dissertation for they are 
                                              likely to miss the point at issue,
