                                              Ghana inherited from the British

                                              policies, formulated without 
                                              regard to their long-term effects 
                                              on the socio-economic development

                                              the colonial government. A proper

                                              An examination of the background 
                                              to the introduction of such

                                              would be discovered that the

                                              separate independent polities.&nbsp; 
                                              Boundaries between such 
                                              traditional states were neither 
                                              abolished, defined nor 
                                              demarcated.&nbsp; For over three 
                                              centuries, the basis of the 
                                              relationship between Britain and 
                                              the Gold Coast was the import - 
                                              export trade which did not require 
                                              direct involvement of British 
                                              subjects in land exploitation.&nbsp; 
                                              Thus until the last two decades of 
                                              the nineteenth century, land 
                                              problems did not concern the

                                              However, the long contact with 
                                              European led to the reception of 
                                              English conceptions of tenure.&nbsp; 
                                              The introduction of commercial 
                                              agriculture based on permanent 
                                              cultivation of cocoa and coffee 
                                              plantations and the development of 
                                              the mining and timber industries 
                                              during the 1880s had significant 
                                              impacts on the traditional land 
                                              tenure systems. The concession 
                                              boom which accompanied these 
                                              developments caused problems. Land 
                                              values appreciated and rights to 
                                              them became keenly contested. 
                                              Since boundaries remained 
                                              undefined, there were conflicting 
                                              and overlapping concession grants. 
                                              English conveyancing forms and 
                                              terminology which the native 
                                              grantors could not understand were 
                                              employed in drafting concession 
                                              agreements. It was difficult for 
                                              strangers2 to identify the persons 
                                              with legal capacity to deal with 
                                              the lands which were group-held 
                                              property. These problems caused 
                                              insecurity of titles and costly

                                              measures was mounted by the few 
                                              native merchant class, lawyers and 
                                              the educated elite who allied

                                              of a colonised people over an

                                              of the 1890s sought to achieve 
                                              this result. Despite any criticism

                                              firms, the fact remains that the

                                              were mere restatements of the

                                              way in which the introduction of 
                                              certain Ordinances aimed at

                                              shown that the pursuit of such a 
                                              policy led to the creation of a

                                              of such rights became dependent on

                                              focused on how this policy led, in 
                                              principle, to the abolition in

                                              boundary disputes. These were the

                                              title and costly litigation, a 
                                              phenomenon which had caused the

                                              such policies resulted in the

                                              to happen. It is thus intended to

                                              historical perspective, 
                                              highlighting the beneficial

                                              parts of the country. It is hoped

                                              protectorates and outside the

                                              would be inconvenient.11 This 
                                              argument did not convince the

                                              steps should be taken to effect a 
                                              formal annexation of the protected

                                              the Colony, while he was in London 
                                              in the autumn of 1900, he assured 
                                              the Secretary of State that the 
                                              natives of the region were ready

                                              trade and friendship signed with 
                                              the Queen, was a very important 
                                              factor in the establishment of 
                                              British jurisdiction over the

                                              However, in the Colony and 
                                              Ashanti, the people attached great 
                                              importance to land rights and were 
                                              beginning to treat them as an 
                                              article of commerce. Any policy 
                                              which appeared to them as likely 
                                              to violate land rights met with 
                                              vehement protests. In the Northern 
                                              Territories, however, attitudes to 
                                              land rights were completely 
                                              different. Land was conceived of, 
                                              not as an estate or a possession 
                                              of any particular value,17 but as 
                                              part of the universe, just as the 
                                              sun, the moon and the stars, and 
                                              &quot;no question of monetary interest 
                                              in land existed any more than in 
                                              the constellations.&quot;18</span></p>

                                              In the Provincial Commissioner's 
                                              Report, it was noted that lands 
                                              occupied by the Walas, Dagartis 
                                              and probably the Grunshies, were 
                                              not recognised as being owned by 
                                              the tribe, chief, village or 
                                              individuals.19 There were no 
                                              boundaries between the villages, 
                                              and uncultivated land between them 
                                              was considered as common ground 
                                              for the collection of natural 
                                              fruits and hunting. The Dagombas, 
                                              for example, were reported to have 
                                              held land on condition that such 
                                              land could not be sold.&nbsp; No money 
                                              could be taken for leasing it, and 
                                              it could be granted or rights to 
                                              it given up, only by the consent 
                                              of the chief. </span></p>

                                              report of the Provincial 
                                              Commissioner for Navrongo gave 
                                              similar accounts of native

                                              and the land tenure systems 
                                              generally. The report stated that 
                                              in Lobi, Dagarti, Issala and 
                                              Grunshie, lands were &quot;commonly 
                                              owned.&quot;20 A religious leader

                                              the lands in &quot;trust&quot; for the

                                              the land. His role was mainly 
                                              concerned with the performance of 
                                              religious rites which were 
                                              considered necessary to appease 
                                              the spirits to ensure plentiful 
                                              harvest. Tribute, if paid at all, 
                                              was voluntary, and was nominally 
                                              paid to the fetish priest.21</span></p>

                                              In South Mamprusi, the idea of

                                              live without it, could not be

                                              occupation and use, a stranger was 
                                              one who came from a far country,

                                              found, no one was regarded as a

                                              It is significant to note that 
                                              even in modern Ghana, chiefs in 
                                              the Dagomba Traditional Area of 
                                              the North do not accept monetary 
                                              consideration for the grant of 
                                              land rights. The writer was told 
                                              by traditional elders spoken to 
                                              that they would prefer to accept 
                                              kola-nuts and any amount of 
                                              produce which the grantee might 
                                              offer as presents. Such presents 
                                              have no bearing on the size of 
                                              land occupied by the grantee or 
                                              the harvest.23 The overall picture 
                                              portrayed by these early accounts 
                                              of the land tenure systems is that 
                                              no economic value as such attached 
                                              to land. Land was abundant, demand 
                                              for it was negligible, and it thus 
                                              had no market value. Hence claims 
                                              of right to or over it did not 
                                              feature prominently in the land 
                                              tenure systems of the Northern 
                                              Territories. </span></p>

                                              During the time when the 
                                              Concessions Ordinance was being 
                                              considered, the colonial

                                              above. But it had a fair idea 
                                              about the general attitude of the 
                                              natives in the North to land 
                                              matters. The government had a fair 
                                              idea about the differences in the 
                                              land tenure systems of Ashanti and 
                                              most of the native communities in 
                                              the Colony on the one hand, and 
                                              the tenure systems of the tribes

                                              In Ashanti and most areas of the 
                                              Colony, the system for the 
                                              administration and enjoyment of 
                                              rights in land was fundamental to 
                                              the structure of government. The 
                                              appreciation of land values due to 
                                              the development of the mining and 
                                              timber industries was increasing 
                                              the economic and political power 
                                              of chiefs and community leaders 
                                              who exercised rights of control 
                                              over lands. Apart from these 
                                              developments, there was a great 
                                              deal of sentimental attachment to 
                                              land in Ashanti and the Colony. 
                                              These were the main reasons why 
                                              any land policy which would have 
                                              the effect of reducing the power 
                                              of chiefs usually met with strong 
                                              protests. </span></p>

                                              In the Northern Territories, 
                                              however, there was no concrete 
                                              evidence of such sentimental 
                                              attachment to land. Land control 
                                              functions did not necessarily 
                                              devolve on those exercising 
                                              political power in the community. 
                                              The political and economic powers 
                                              associated with the control of 
                                              land in Ashanti and the Colony 
                                              were thus absent in the Northern 
                                              Territories. For these reasons, 
                                              the government was aware that no 
                                              serious opposition to its 
                                              authority was likely, even if it 
                                              introduced laws affecting land, 
                                              having regard to the general 
                                              notion of land by the people in 
                                              that region, which may be summed 
                                              up in the words of a Gonja chief 
                                              of Pombe, who in reply to a 
                                              question as to whom, in native 
                                              opinion, the land belonged to, 
                                              replied, &quot;As the people belong to 
                                              the government, how much more then 
                                              does not the land they live on.&quot;24

                                              This statement by the chief might 
                                              well have stemmed from fear and 
                                              despair and might not have been a

                                              of the chief and his people. 
                                              Nevertheless, it showed that they 
                                              would not oppose the government 
                                              for any land reform programme or 
                                              policy that might be designed for

                                              above the government, having 
                                              witnessed the problems arising 
                                              from the land tenure systems of 
                                              the Colony and Ashanti, where

                                              land, decided to pursue a 
                                              different policy towards the 
                                              North. A policy similar to those 
                                              of Sir William Maxwell was thus 
                                              adopted as a basis for land 
                                              legislation for the Northern 
                                              Territories. In line with this 
                                              policy, Governor Nathan in July 
                                              1901, made a draft proclamation 
                                              laying down the conditions and 
                                              procedures by which land rights 
                                              might be granted in the Northern 
                                              Territories. In forwarding the 
                                              draft proclamation and 
                                              instructions thereon to the

                                              fact that the procedure involved 
                                              in land grants differed

                                              from the machinery provided under 
                                              the Concessions Ordinance for the

                                              the case of the Northern 
                                              Territories, the grant was to be 
                                              made directly by the government 
                                              and not by any native authority, 
                                              while in the case of the Colony 
                                              and Ashanti, such grants were made 
                                              by traditional authorities and 
                                              subsequently declared as valid or

                                              spite of this, no further 
                                              legislation affecting land was 
                                              introduced in the Northern 
                                              Territories until 1927. This meant 
                                              that the draft proclamation of 
                                              July 1901 remained the only basis 
                                              for the exercise of administrative 
                                              rights over lands by the 
                                              government. As pointed out 
                                              already, this was mainly due to 
                                              the fact that the government did 
                                              not anticipate that anyone would 
                                              seriously question the basis of 
                                              its actions there. Also, because 
                                              there was relatively no 
                                              large-scale foreign involvement in 
                                              land exploitation there, it was 
                                              thought that no legislation 
                                              defining with particulars of 
                                              detail, the conditions under which 
                                              land should be held was required. 
                                              Moreover, the successors of 
                                              Governor Nathan, particularly Sir 
                                              Hugh Clifford, pursued vigorously 
                                              the policy of indirect rule, which 
                                              was incompatible with the 
                                              principles inherent in the draft 
                                              proclamation of July 1901. Hence, 
                                              no law was enacted to embody its 
                                              principles into legally 
                                              enforceable rules. </span></p>

                                              By the 1920s, however

                                              by chiefs in the South and the 
                                              general disapprobation of the 
                                              anomalies of the land tenure 
                                              systems of the Colony and Ashanti 
                                              saw the beginning of a change in 
                                              policy. For fear that the evils of 
                                              the systems in the South might 
                                              spill over to the North, it was 
                                              decided to crystallise the 
                                              procedures and rules being 
                                              followed in the Northern

                                              rules. Thus, in 1927, an Ordinance 
                                              was introduced with the declared 
                                              purpose of vesting all lands in 
                                              the North in the government.33

                                              These provisions would have had

                                              lands in the Crown, but it was not

                                              were similar to those proposed by 
                                              Sir William Brandford Griffith in 
                                              1894 by which all vacant lands in

                                              vested in the Crown. In this case,

                                              Ordinance, like the abortive Crown 
                                              Lands Ordinance, took into account 
                                              the communal principles of the 
                                              land tenure systems. Hence revenue 
                                              accruing therefrom was to be 
                                              applied for the benefit of the

                                              The Ordinance was, however, not 
                                              brought into force because some 
                                              government officials, particularly 
                                              those in the Northern Territories, 
                                              were not favourably disposed 
                                              towards the introduction of an 
                                              Ordinance, the purpose of which 
                                              would be to confirm what the 
                                              natives assumed to be true, but 
                                              which in fact was not. The Chief 
                                              Commissioner of the Northern 
                                              Territories, for instance, had 
                                              argued earlier in protest against 
                                              such a measure by pointing out 
                                              that since it was generally 
                                              assumed by the natives that all 
                                              unoccupied lands belonged to the 
                                              Government, and could be utilised 
                                              as it saw fit, it was unnecessary 
                                              for the Government to vest them in 
                                              the crown. He argued that unlike 
                                              Northern Nigeria, which was 
                                              arguably a conquered territory and

                                              conquest, the same argument could

                                              principles of Sir William

                                              region. It was this Ordinance

                                              providing a basis for comparative 
                                              analysis of how either system

                                              would enable us to come to a 
                                              conclusion as to whether or not it 
                                              was a right decision to withdraw 
                                              the Public Lands Ordinance of 
                                              1897. </span></p>

                                              With slight variations, the Land 
                                              and Native Rights Ordinance35 
                                              could be seen as a replica of the 
                                              1927 Act which was never brought 
                                              into force. The objects of the 
                                              Ordinance were declared in its 
                                              long preamble. It stated that it 
                                              was necessary to protect and 
                                              preserve existing customary rights 
                                              of the natives to use and enjoy 
                                              the land and the natural fruits 
                                              thereof in sufficient quantity to 
                                              enable them to provide for the 
                                              sustenance of themselves and their 
                                              families. It was also stated that 
                                              it was expedient to preserve the 
                                              customary law with regard to the 
                                              use and occupation of the land as 
                                              far as possible, and that it was 
                                              necessary to define by law the 
                                              rights and obligations of the 
                                              government in regard to the whole 
                                              of the land within the region. The 
                                              rights and obligations of 
                                              cultivators, and other persons 
                                              claiming to have an interest in 
                                              any such land should be defined.

                                              of the Ordinance replaced section

                                              section 3 referred to above

                                              acquired, were to have the same 
                                              effect and validity in all

                                              The effect of this section is 
                                              far-reaching: Although the lands 
                                              were not absolutely vested in the 
                                              Crown as was attempted in 1927, 
                                              their management, control and 
                                              administration were vested in the 
                                              Governor. While it declared that 
                                              the lands should be held and 
                                              administered for the use and 
                                              common benefit direct or indirect 
                                              of the natives, the right of the 
                                              latter to occupy land without 
                                              reference to any person had been 
                                              taken away. This was the logical 
                                              import of the provision that no 
                                              title to the occupation and use of 
                                              any lands would be valid without 
                                              the consent of the Governor. Yet 
                                              another important aspect of the 
                                              provision was the recognition of 
                                              the communal principle in the land 
                                              tenure system by enjoining the 
                                              Governor to hold and administer 
                                              the lands &quot;for the use and common 
                                              benefit&quot; of the natives. This 
                                              underlined the sort of obligation 
                                              towards the people which Sir 
                                              William Maxwell envisaged under 
                                              his abortive Public Lands Bill. 
                                              The emphasis was on the public and 
                                              not on particular individuals.

                                              remarkable feature of the above 
                                              provision is that while it 
                                              enjoined the Governor to have due 
                                              regard to the existing customary 
                                              law, section 6 (b) provided, quite 
                                              contrary to the indigenous 
                                              notions, belief and practice, that 
                                              the Governor should exact rent in 
                                              respect of rights of occupancy. 
                                              The exercise of this right would 
                                              necessarily make serious inroads 
                                              into the generally accepted view 
                                              and practice among the people in 
                                              the Northern Territories that no 
                                              monetary consideration was 
                                              exigible for the use or the 
                                              transfer of an interest in land. 
                                              Another significant aspect of 
                                              section 6 was the power conferred 
                                              on the Governor to grant land to 
                                              both natives and non-natives. The 
                                              right of occupancy no longer 
                                              depended necessarily on membership 
                                              of a land-holding group, such as 
                                              the family or a clan. It now 
                                              depended on the disposition of the 
                                              Governor. Here, it is important to 
                                              note that the Ordinance did not 
                                              prescribe differing terms for 
                                              strangers and Northerners. </span>

                                              As we shall see presently, one of 
                                              the far-reaching effects of this 
                                              provision is that up till now, the 
                                              Lands Department, upon whom the

                                              in the Northern and Upper Regions 
                                              devolves, does not draw any 
                                              distinction between the people of 
                                              the North and other Ghanaians in 
                                              matters relating to land 
                                              acquisition, a policy which was to 
                                              have been the cornerstone of 
                                              Maxwell's land policy. The 
                                              cumulative effect of sections 4, 5 
                                              and 6 was that the natives of the 
                                              Northern Territories could no 
                                              longer in principle exercise their 
                                              inherent rights as members of a 
                                              landholding community validly to 
                                              establish rights to land through 
                                              effective occupation unless by the 
                                              sanction of the Governor. What 
                                              this means in effect is that the 
                                              majority of local people are today

                                              measures, a dual system of land 
                                              administration was established in 
                                              the country. In the Northern

                                              authorities were assumed by the

                                              traditional authorities were 
                                              allowed to continue in the 
                                              exercise of their traditional

                                              from time to time. It should be 
                                              pointed out that the role of the 
                                              State and its agencies in land 
                                              matters in the North is that of an 
                                              administrator. The lands are not 
                                              vested in the State by any of the 
                                              laws described above. It is 
                                              important not to confuse this fact 
                                              of administration with 
                                              nationalisation. Although the way

                                              equally in the matter of land 
                                              acquisition in the North would 
                                              seem to create the impression that 
                                              the lands are state-owned, as far 
                                              as the law is concerned, this is 
                                              far from the truth. This fact must 
                                              continually be borne in mind in 
                                              the discussion of the merits and 
                                              demerits of the system in the

                                              Interestingly enough, although the

                                              criticised this type of policy in 
                                              the past, these laws were not 
                                              abolished after independence. They 
                                              were rather consolidated under 
                                              other statutes. One obvious reason 
                                              for this attitude of the 
                                              independent government of Ghana 
                                              was that it recognised the 
                                              benefits of such a system. An 
                                              additional reason was that the 
                                              people of the North did not 
                                              complain about the system imposed 
                                              on them during the colonial 
                                              period. Today, however, as a 
                                              reaction to the power and profit 
                                              gained by traditional elders 
                                              through their land-control 
                                              functions, particularly in Akan 
                                              communities of the country, the 
                                              people of the North are now 
                                              calling for the abolition of the 
                                              system established in their 
                                              regions.37 Other calls for the 
                                              abolition of the system by those 
                                              who now regard the system as the 
                                              vestiges of colonialism are based 
                                              on ignorance of the way in which 
                                              the system works in practice.38 In 
                                              order to explain the benefits of 
                                              the system we shall discuss the 
                                              way in which the independent 
                                              government retained the system 
                                              after independence because of its 
                                              beneficial effects. </span></p>

                                              After more than two decades of 
                                              independence, land policy in Ghana 
                                              basically remains what was 
                                              inherited from the colonial era. 
                                              The government having no new 
                                              policy of its own, various 
                                              statutes were introduced to 
                                              re-enact or add to what was 
                                              previously existing before 
                                              independence. One such statute 
                                              which has a bearing on the 
                                              continuation of the system 
                                              established in the North is the

                                              1960.39&nbsp; The main objective of 
                                              this statute was to bring the 
                                              statute laws of Ghana into 
                                              conformity with the Republican 
                                              status of the State. Section 2 of

                                              Here again, it should be remarked

                                              It is thus clear that these

                                              the colonial era. It should, 
                                              however, be observed that the way 
                                              in which the executive instruments 
                                              were formulated discloses gross 
                                              ignorance about the indigenous 
                                              land tenure systems of the 
                                              Northern Regions. The underlying 
                                              assumption of the executive 
                                              instruments giving effect to this 
                                              policy is that all the local 
                                              council areas specified under the 
                                              schedules were stool lands. In the 
                                              Dagomba Traditional Area of the 
                                              Northern Region where the Dagomba 
                                              conquerors established their 
                                              hegemony over the original 
                                              settlers, such assumptions might 
                                              be valid, to some extent, where 
                                              skin lands might be regarded as 
                                              the counterpart of the Akan-type 
                                              stool lands. But this can 
                                              certainly not be true of the 
                                              generally acephalous societies of

                                              instruments might arguably be 
                                              mistaken, they have been generally 
                                              regarded as having vested the 
                                              administration of all lands in the 
                                              two regions in the President.

                                              Later, further additions were made 
                                              to the main provisions by the 
                                              Lands Commission (Amendment) 
                                              Decree, 1972.47 It provided for 
                                              the appointment of a regional 
                                              sub-committee of the Lands 
                                              Commission for each region

                                              fit. Such regional sub-committees 
                                              shall discharge any functions 
                                              which may be referred to it by the 
                                              commission.48 Subject to the 
                                              directions in writing of the 
                                              commission, the regional 
                                              sub-committee may, in the exercise 
                                              of its functions, regulate its own 
                                              affairs. The additions made by 
                                              these enactments were intended to 
                                              decentralise the administration 
                                              system so as to avoid unnecessary 
                                              bureaucracy, and to encourage the 
                                              formulation of policy with regard 
                                              to local circumstances of each 
                                              region and community. Therefore, 
                                              in principle, the responsibility 
                                              for the general administration of 
                                              lands effected by these laws 
                                              devolves on the Lands Commission. 
                                              There were, however, problems 
                                              arising from the administration 
                                              system. We shall therefore 
                                              consider next the nature of the 
                                              problems and how they may be 
                                              minimised or resolved altogether.

                                              sanction will be of no legal 
                                              effect.49 However, members of the 
                                              general public are inadequately 
                                              informed about the true legal 
                                              position on these matters. As a 
                                              result, some of the traditional 
                                              authorities operate under the 
                                              mistaken belief that they have 
                                              legal rights to dispose of 
                                              interests in land in their areas 
                                              of authority. Today, the majority 
                                              of the local population are, in 
                                              principle, in illegal occupation 
                                              of lands in their possession with 
                                              the acquiescence of the Lands

                                              All these problems need not arise 
                                              if the role of the Lands 
                                              Commission in land matters is 
                                              properly explained to the public. 
                                              For an examination of the Lands 
                                              Commission's land allocation 
                                              policy will reveal that the 
                                              principles upon which it operates 
                                              are not significantly different 
                                              from the indigenous principles. 
                                              For instance, under Dagomba 
                                              customary land law, land is not 
                                              regarded as an article of 
                                              commerce. The sale of land is 
                                              regarded as an abomination 
                                              punishable by the gods of the 
                                              land. It is also a sin against the 
                                              gods to deny a man the use of it. 
                                              As we have seen earlier, it is not 
                                              only the indigenous people to whom 
                                              the use of land ought not to be 
                                              denied but strangers as well. 
                                              These ideas generally permeate 
                                              traditional land tenure systems of 
                                              the North.</span></p>

                                              community concerned, is required 
                                              to present a gift of kola-nuts. 
                                              The kola-nut is only a present. It 
                                              is not a consideration for the 
                                              grant, but is of political and 
                                              religious significance. It serves 
                                              as a recognition of the grantor's 
                                              authority in the area and is at 
                                              the same time used for prayers to 
                                              the gods, the givers of rain and 
                                              sunshine which are necessary for 
                                              plentiful harvest. The grantee is 
                                              warned that the right conceded is 
                                              for surface use only, and if the 
                                              land is abandoned the right 
                                              reverts to the community. The only 
                                              obligation on the land user is 
                                              that at the end of each harvest he 
                                              must present a portion of his 
                                              harvest to the grantor. The 
                                              quantum of his present has no 
                                              relation to the amount of harvest 
                                              on the area of land cultivated. 
                                              Such a present is only a token 
                                              gift in recognition of the 
                                              grantor's authority over the land.

                                              upon which leases are granted to 
                                              people largely conform to the 
                                              traditional norms. What the Lands

                                              assume the role of the traditional 
                                              authorities and to perform their 
                                              land control functions for them.

                                              The duration of a lease granted 
                                              depends on the purpose for which 
                                              the grant is required. Included in 
                                              the terms of the grant is always a 
                                              term to the effect that if the 
                                              land remains undeveloped in the 
                                              manner stated within a specified 
                                              period the lease lapses. This is 
                                              consistent with the indigenous law 
                                              under which the land reverts to 
                                              the community upon abandonment. 
                                              The way in which land grants by 
                                              the Lands Commission differs from 
                                              the traditional methods is that it 
                                              requires the payment of monetary 
                                              consideration for the grant.</span></p>

                                              However, this is not something 
                                              against which the local people 
                                              should complain in modern times, 
                                              and there is no evidence that the 
                                              practice is objected to. Indeed, 
                                              the payment of money for land 
                                              grants is one of the ways in which 
                                              state administration confers 
                                              benefit on the communities of the 
                                              North. As noted earlier, although 
                                              the lands are managed and 
                                              controlled like State lands, it is 
                                              recognised that they were once 
                                              held by the indigenous inhabitants 
                                              of the North. Therefore rents 
                                              accruing from land grants are 
                                              employed for the development of 
                                              the communities from which they 
                                              are due.50</span></p>

                                              In effect, communities of the 
                                              North benefit from the competent 
                                              administrative skills of 
                                              government officials in land 
                                              administration, while the ordinary 
                                              citizen benefits from community 
                                              resources through the social 
                                              services which the moneys paid

                                              might help to provide. An 
                                              additional advantage for 
                                              individuals of State control of 
                                              lands in the North is certainty

                                              During the colonial period, the 
                                              people of the North were prepared 
                                              to allow the government the 
                                              freedom to exercise control over 
                                              lands' erroneously believing that 
                                              the Treaties of Friendship and 
                                              Trade entered into with the Queen 
                                              took away their land control 
                                              rights.&nbsp; They did not attach any 
                                              great importance to lands as an 
                                              article of commerce. &nbsp;This was 
                                              largely due to the fact that the 
                                              slave trade by depopulating the 
                                              area, had reduced pressure on land 
                                              in use in the area. Furthermore, 
                                              although there were rumours about 
                                              gold and lime deposits in the area 
                                              and its potential for cotton

                                              large-scale demand for concessions

                                              granary of the country became 
                                              recognised.&nbsp; The recent rice boom 
                                              in the region during the 
                                              &quot;Operation Feed Yourself&quot; campaign 
                                              is a pointer to this fact.&nbsp; Apart 
                                              from these factors, the population

                                              North as a rallying point for 
                                              protest against what they might 
                                              consider as an unfair land policy 
                                              towards their region.&nbsp; Today, 
                                              there are many persons who belong 
                                              to the educated elite and nascent 
                                              middle class in the North.&nbsp; These 
                                              factors have all combined to 
                                              create new problems for the Lands

                                              would seem to be what they regard

                                              With respect, this aspect of the 
                                              resolution is misconceived. In 
                                              fact, instead of the uniformity 
                                              they seek to achieve, the opposite 
                                              result will be the consequences of 
                                              the change they are calling for. 
                                              If the system is abolished, 
                                              inter-tribal boundaries would have 
                                              to be re-defined and the terms on

                                              rules prevailing in each tribe or 
                                              community. Certain general 
                                              principles are common to all the 
                                              systems but they differ in 
                                              particulars of detail. Having 
                                              regard to these facts, it is 
                                              difficult to see how the abolition 
                                              of the present system will have 
                                              the effect of harmonising land 
                                              tenure and administration in the

                                              The resolution is based on the

                                              way in which the two regions have 
                                              been differently treated from the 
                                              rest of the country in land 
                                              matters. They cannot see why, if 
                                              land policy towards the North is a 
                                              sound one, it should not be made 
                                              to apply throughout the country.52

                                              There is some justification for 
                                              the present attitude of the people 
                                              of the North in expressing 
                                              dissatisfaction about the lack of 
                                              a uniform policy on lands for the 
                                              whole country. It must be noted 
                                              that any Ghanaian, whether he be 
                                              an Ewe, a Fante or an Ashanti from 
                                              the South, can obtain land in the 
                                              North from the Lands Commission on 
                                              the same terms as a Dagomba or a 
                                              Sissala of the North, but no 
                                              person from the North can enjoy 
                                              similar rights in other parts of 
                                              the country. This is one way in 
                                              which people of the North can 
                                              justifiably regard the present 
                                              land administration system as 
                                              being discriminatory although the

                                              of rights in land in the North,

                                              In the same way, people from other 
                                              parts of the country are accorded 
                                              the same rights as those from the

                                              administered and controlled in the

                                              The originators of this policy 
                                              should be commended for their 
                                              foresight and initiative. 
                                              Evidently, the principles 
                                              governing land administration in 
                                              the North today are practically 
                                              those originated by Sir William 
                                              Brandford Griffith in his Crown 
                                              Lands Ordinance of 1894, 
                                              reformulated and clearly 
                                              articulated by Sir William Maxwell 
                                              in his abortive Public Lands Bill 
                                              of 1897 and in his memoranda and 
                                              speeches thereon. Although many of 
                                              the critics did not appreciate the 
                                              wisdom of their policies then, 
                                              with time they grew to understand 
                                              the good sense of it and thus 
                                              introduced it in the North. The 
                                              results achieved today can thus be 
                                              seen as a clear vindication of the 
                                              vision and foresight of Maxwell.

                                              has had far-reaching beneficial

                                              community at large: Firstly, the 
                                              non-recognition of inter-tribal 
                                              boundaries between the various 
                                              ethnic groups of the North has 
                                              harmonised the system of land 
                                              administration. The elimination of 
                                              such boundaries means that there 
                                              no longer exists any basis for 
                                              disputes concerning inter-tribal 
                                              boundaries. The boundaries which 
                                              exist are those carved out by the 
                                              government for political and 
                                              administrative purposes. Questions 
                                              relating to boundaries are

                                              has become unnecessary for the 
                                              courts to determine the issue

                                              This was the cornerstone of Sir 
                                              William Maxwell's policy regarding 
                                              all lands in the country as public 
                                              lands.53 He recognised in the 
                                              traditional systems of tenure a 
                                              communal principle by which land 
                                              was regarded as a community asset 
                                              and resource to which no 
                                              individual should be permitted to 
                                              lay exclusive claims. He had 
                                              wanted to widen the scope of this 
                                              principle to embrace the whole 
                                              country through his abortive Lands 
                                              Bill of 1897. The results achieved 
                                              in the North today are a 
                                              vindication of the wisdom of his 
                                              policy. The fact that the 
                                              post-independence government found 
                                              it unnecessary to abolish the 
                                              system, but consolidated it with 
                                              its own laws, may be seen as a 
                                              recognition of the advantages of 
                                              the system. Today, the majority of 
                                              those closely connected with land 
                                              problems in the country are agreed 
                                              that nothing short of the 
                                              introduction of a system of land 
                                              administration similar to that in

                                              can effectively deal with Ghana's 
                                              land problems. </span></p>

                                              It may be argued that insecurity 
                                              of title was no problem in the 
                                              North because there was no great 
                                              demand for land in those areas 
                                              during colonial times. An answer 
                                              to such an argument is that the 
                                              question is not whether there was 
                                              large-scale acquisition of land. 
                                              What should be considered is 
                                              whether the conditions which give 
                                              rise to insecurity have been 
                                              removed. The elimination of the 
                                              inherent problems associated with 
                                              insecurity is the more important 
                                              thing to consider. In any case, 
                                              the recent rice boom that 
                                              accompanied the &quot;Operation Feed 
                                              Yourself &quot; campaign of 1972, and 
                                              which has led to a scramble for 
                                              land in the &quot;rice belt,&quot; has not 
                                              given rise to problems of 
                                              uncertainty and its associated 
                                              costly litigation. In fact, in 
                                              those cases where grants were made 
                                              by the Lands Commission in 
                                              conflict with the traditional 
                                              authorities, the matter was easily 
                                              resolved administratively. </span>

                                              There is ample evidence in the 
                                              North and other parts of Africa 
                                              suggesting that state agency 
                                              administration of lands can lead 
                                              to greater certainty. In Northern

                                              similar to that of the Northern 
                                              Ghana, lands in that region were 
                                              vested in the colonial government, 
                                              a policy continued by the 
                                              post-independence government of 
                                              Nigeria, titles have remained

                                              This Decree will certainly have 
                                              the effect of harmonising the land 
                                              tenure systems of Nigeria if the 
                                              terms of its provisions are 
                                              complied with. The logical import 
                                              of this Decree is that like the 
                                              Northern Region of Ghana, tribal, 
                                              community or family membership 
                                              basis of the enjoyment of rights 
                                              in land has been replaced by the 
                                              concept of Nigerian citizenship as 
                                              entitling the citizen to enjoy 
                                              land and the fruits thereof for 
                                              the sustenance of himself and his 
                                              family. It is submitted that this 
                                              is a progressive and a healthy 
                                              policy, albeit a colonial 
                                              heritage. </span></p>

                                              If we look beyond Africa South of

                                              beneficial effects of the

                                              colonial administration abolished 
                                              tribal tenure before the British 
                                              took over the country as a 
                                              mandated territory, the latter did 
                                              not encounter the sort of land 
                                              problems with which they became so

                                              territories of Uganda and Kenya. 
                                              This German policy paved the way

                                              The trend in the formulation of 
                                              national land policies indicates a 
                                              tendency towards a return to 
                                              certain aspects of colonial land 
                                              policies of the past. In Northern 
                                              Nigeria and Ghana, there is no 
                                              doubt that such policies have had 
                                              their beneficial effects. It 
                                              should therefore be not only as a 
                                              matter of regret but of great 
                                              concern, for what would appear to 
                                              be a call on the part of the 1978 
                                              Constitutional Commission of 
                                              Ghana, for the abolition of the 
                                              present land administration system 
                                              in the North of the country by 
                                              reason only that the system was 
                                              established during colonial times.

                                              present lack of uniformity in the

                                              and Upper Regions are deemed to be 
                                              `public lands' and, as such, are 
                                              vested in the Government of Ghana, 
                                              whereas stool lands in other 
                                              regions of Ghana are considered as 
                                              being vested in the stools 
                                              concerned. We recognise that this 
                                              arrangement has been carried over 
                                              from the colonial era and from 
                                              previous constitutions and laws. 
                                              We, however, consider that this 
                                              system is unjustifiable, 
                                              inequitable and anachronistic. We, 
                                              therefore recommend that it be 
                                              abolished . . .&quot; </span></p>

                                              modern requirements. The

                                              conclusion on the erroneous 
                                              assumption that any arrangement 
                                              carried over from colonial times 
                                              is necessarily out of date, unjust

                                              The commission seems to be saying 
                                              that because stool lands are

                                              and inequitable. Does this mean 
                                              that the operation of two 
                                              different systems of land 
                                              administration in one country 
                                              necessarily leads to inequity and 
                                              injustice? The injustice or

                                              can only be objectively determined 
                                              by the examination and analysis of
