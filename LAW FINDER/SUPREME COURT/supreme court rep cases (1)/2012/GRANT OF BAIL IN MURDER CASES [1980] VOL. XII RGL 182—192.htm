                                              Act 30 from granting bail in 
                                              murder cases, having regard to the 
                                              provisions of article 15 (3) (b) 
                                              and (4) of the 1969 Constitution, 
                                              it was quite clear that in all 
                                              cases, including murder, if an 
                                              accused on a murder charge, was 
                                              not tried within a reasonable 
                                              time, then he was entitled to be 
                                              released on bail.5</span></p>

                                              It is to be noted that Taylor J.’s 
                                              view that a person charged with 
                                              murder could be granted bail 
                                              notwithstanding the mandatory 
                                              provisions of section 96 (7) is 
                                              also supported by Aboagye J. in 
                                              Prah v. The Republic6 but for 
                                              different reasons. In this case, 
                                              Aboagye J. held that the mandatory 
                                              provisions of section 96 (7) were 
                                              applicable only where the accused 
                                              has been properly charged with 
                                              murder. He therefore held that in 
                                              the circumstances of the case, 
                                              since the applicants, by their 
                                              affidavit in support of the 
                                              application for bail, had denied 
                                              the charge of murder but no 
                                              affidavit in opposition had been 
                                              filed by the Republic, the 
                                              applicants’ denial was deemed to 
                                              have been admitted. Consequently 
                                              the applicants could not be said 
                                              to have been properly charged and 
                                              would therefore be admitted to 
                                              bail. The same conclusion was 
                                              reached by Roger Korsah J. in 
                                              Seidu v. The Republic7 where his 
                                              lordship held that the 
                                              “provisional charge” of murder was 
                                              unknown to the criminal law of 
                                              Ghana and that there being no 
                                              proper charge of murder preferred 
                                              against the applicants, they would 
                                              be admitted to bail, the mandatory 
                                              provisions of Act 30, s. 96 (7) 
                                              notwithstanding. His lordship held 
                                              that those whom the legislature 
                                              intended section 96 of Act 30 to 
                                              cover were those against whom, the 
                                              charge of murder preferred could 
                                              be said by the court to be 
                                              supported by evidence which the 
                                              prosecution professed to have, and 
                                              not persons against whom there was 
                                              no legally acceptable evidence 
                                              connecting them with the charge of 
                                              murder.</span></p>

                                              It is evident that in the Prah and 
                                              Seidu cases, the High Court in 
                                              effect held that the words of Act 
                                              30, s. 96 (7) were mandatory and 
                                              completely disabled the court from 
                                              granting bail in murder cases 
                                              where an accused was properly 
                                              charged with murder. In the Seidu 
                                              case Roger Korsah J. held that the 
                                              phrase “shall refuse” in Act 30, 
                                              s. 96 (7) meant that the High 
                                              Court should not exercise its 
                                              power to grant hail in murder 
                                              cases. Thus the Prah and Seidu 
                                              cases do not in fact accept the 
                                              interpretation earlier put on Act 
                                              30, s.96 (7) by Taylor J. in the 
                                              Dogbe case.8</span></p>

                                              The exponent of this divergent 
                                              view is Osei-Hwere J. who in 
                                              Donkor v. The Republic9 sharply 
                                              criticised and refused to accept 
                                              the interpretation put on Act 30, 
                                              s. 96 (7) by Taylor J. in the 
                                              Dogbe case. In the Donkor case, 
                                              the applicant was provisionally 
                                              charged with the offence of 
                                              subversion contrary to the 
                                              Subversion Decree, 1972 (N.R.C.D. 
                                              90), s. 1 before a district court 
                                              which remanded him in custody. He 
                                              therefore applied to the High 
                                              Court for bail because there had 
                                              been unreasonable delay in 
                                              prosecuting his case in terms of 
                                              article 15 (3) (b) of the 
                                              Constitution, 1969, which in the 
                                              view of his counsel, prevailed 
                                              over Act 30, s. 96 (7) which

                                              including Article 15 had been 
                                              suspended by section 2 (1) of the

                                              the supreme law but a mere 
                                              enactment under the provisions of 
                                              the Interpretation Act, 1960 (C.A.

                                              to and from courts, the failure of 
                                              counsel to appear in court due to 
                                              unavoidable circumstances and the 
                                              very fact that a person facing a 
                                              murder charge has been on remand 
                                              for more than three years as 
                                              happened in the Brefor case and 
                                              lack of prospect for an immediate 
                                              trial, are compelling reasons 
                                              contributing to the fact that an 
                                              accused person has “not been tried 
                                              within a reasonable time” within 
                                              the meaning of article 21 (4) (a) 
                                              of the 1979 Constitution. In 
                                              Gyakye v. The Republic13 the 
                                              applicants on a murder charge 
                                              applied for bail. Coussey J. (as 
                                              he then was) having found that 
                                              there was no indication as to when 
                                              the trial of the accused would 
                                              start and that it was unlikely 
                                              that they would be tried soon, 
                                              held that the applicants had not 
                                              been tried within a reasonable 
                                              time within the meaning of Article 
                                              15 (4) of the Constitution, 1969. 
                                              Again, in Owusu v. The Republic14 
                                              Andoh J. held that three years' 
                                              incarceration of the accused 
                                              charged with abetment of murder 
                                              without trial, meant that the 
                                              accused had not been tried within 
                                              a reasonable time as was required 
                                              by article 21 (3) (b) and (4) of 
                                              the Constitution, 1979, and that 
                                              any argument to the contrary could 
                                              not be taken seriously especially 
                                              when the incarceration was said to 
                                              affect the health of the 
                                              application. Andoh J. clarified 
                                              the position when he said:</span></p>

                                              and more is clearly such a delay 
                                              as by the Constitution, 1979, a 
                                              court shall be bound to grant 
                                              bail. It is a situation like this, 
                                              an abuse tantamount to suppression 
                                              or oppression, which the 
                                              Constitution seeks to check or

                                              The interpretation put on the 
                                              words “not tried within a 
                                              reasonable time” by Coussey J. in 
                                              the Gyakye case and by Andoh J. in 
                                              the Owusu case is in accord with 
                                              criminal justice that a person 
                                              should not be subjected to 
                                              punishment in any form until he 
                                              has been found guilty by a court 
                                              of law. It certainly gives comfort 
                                              to accused persons charged with 
                                              murder who through no fault of any 
                                              person find themselves languishing 
                                              in jail for years on remand. 
                                              Needless to say, the decision in 
                                              the Gyakye and Owusu cases is more 
                                              preferable to that in the Brefor 
                                              case.</span></p>

                                              reasoning is that it is based on 
                                              the assumption that article 15 (3) 
                                              (b) and (4) of the 1969 
                                              Constitution still remained in
