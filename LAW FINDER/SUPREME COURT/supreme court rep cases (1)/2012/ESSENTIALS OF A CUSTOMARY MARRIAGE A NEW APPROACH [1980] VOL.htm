                                              THE absence of documents 
                                              evidencing a customary marriage 
                                              presents the courts with difficult 
                                              problems when they are faced with 
                                              the question whether or not a 
                                              customary marriage exists. Such 
                                              questions arise most often in, but 
                                              not limited to, situations 
                                              involving succession and 
                                              inheritance,1 suits to establish 
                                              paternity and maintenance,2 
                                              seduction actions3 and in caveats 
                                              objecting to the celebration of 
                                              Christian monogamous marriages by 
                                              a party who claims to be already 
                                              married to one of the intending 
                                              celebrants.4 The approach of the 
                                              courts has invariably been to test 
                                              the assertion of marriage against 
                                              certain so-called essentials of a 
                                              customary law marriage.&nbsp; And 
                                              towards this end they have 
                                              proceeded purportedly upon the 
                                              authority of text writers—mainly 
                                              anthropologists and sociologists. 
                                              On closer examination, however, it 
                                              often turns out that the so-called 
                                              essentials are nothing more than 
                                              the stages, procedures and phases 
                                              of the customary marriage process 
                                              as seen and described by these 
                                              writers. In any case, as one would 
                                              expect, the various authors, with 
                                              different objectives and 
                                              consequent relative emphases or 
                                              omissions (as the case might be) 
                                              hardly have a common position on 
                                              many important issues. Paying 
                                              little heed to the different aims 
                                              and approaches of these authors, 
                                              the courts have nevertheless, upon 
                                              reliance on their material, 
                                              erected these descriptions into 
                                              rigid requirements against which 
                                              customary marriages are legally 
                                              tested.5</span></p>

                                              One also has an inkling that the 
                                              courts have been misled by western 
                                              concepts of marriage which are not 
                                              only heavily influenced by 
                                              Christian morals but are also 
                                              mainly statutorily governed.6&nbsp; It 
                                              seems ironic in this respect that 
                                              the common law marriage which has 
                                              some important similarities with 
                                              our customary marriage especially 
                                              in its informality and could 
                                              therefore have provided guidance 
                                              in this area has often been 
                                              forgotten in situations where 
                                              reliance on them could have been 
                                              most apposite. This article is 
                                              intended to challenge the 
                                              so-called essentials of a 
                                              customary marriage underlying the 
                                              basis of court decisions, and to 
                                              suggest that the muddle and 
                                              uncertainty have largely been 
                                              generated through over-reliance on 
                                              formality instead of content. It 
                                              seeks to achieve this by looking 
                                              critically at the social science 
                                              material, the cases and current 
                                              observable social fact. It then 
                                              suggests a better approach by 
                                              showing that it is not that the 
                                              so-called &quot;essentials&quot; or 
                                              &quot;requirements&quot; of a customary 
                                              marriage are wholly irrelevant but 
                                              that they are no more than a small 
                                              part of the totality of evidence

                                              This article is a by-product of

                                              1884.7 &nbsp;The research was conducted 
                                              over a six-month period in the two 
                                              towns of Cape Coast in the Central 
                                              Region and Berekum in the 
                                              Brong-Ahafo Region. Although 
                                              peripheral to the main objectives 
                                              at the time, impetus for a closer 
                                              examination of when and how 
                                              customary marriages were effected 
                                              arose from administering a 
                                              questionnaire on married persons 
                                              for the above project. It was 
                                              anticipated from the start that 
                                              the great majority of the would-be 
                                              respondents would be customarily 
                                              married. But then that led to a 
                                              further problem and hence, this 
                                              work. For it became obvious that 
                                              the real or married status of 
                                              respondents be authenticated from 
                                              the start or such information as 
                                              they gave might emanate from a

                                              Doubts had always existed among 
                                              some skeptical minds about the 
                                              legal requirements of a customary 
                                              marriage as enunciated by the 
                                              courts.8&nbsp; With that skepticism in 
                                              mind, it was however intended to 
                                              proceed using the court's rules as 
                                              guidelines and to admit as valid 
                                              only those marriages that met the 
                                              case law requirements of a 
                                              customary marriage. Had that 
                                              rigidity been adhered to, perhaps 
                                              the entire work would have had to 
                                              be abandoned for it turned out 
                                              early in the research that the 
                                              overwhelming number of customary 
                                              marriages failed under the court's 
                                              criteria. It became only sensible 
                                              to relax the &quot;legal&quot; standards and 
                                              therefore a person's declaration 
                                              that he was married was taken on 
                                              its face value. This method, as it 
                                              was later discovered, was not 
                                              novel for in the 1970 Census of/or 
                                              Ghana, the census planners and 
                                              field enumerators had adopted the 
                                              same position, i.e. they accepted 
                                              the declarations of persons who 
                                              said they were married without 
                                              challenge.9&nbsp; Even though it may be 
                                              realistic for other purposes, such 
                                              a situation is clearly 
                                              unsatisfactory for legal purposes 
                                              especially in situations where the 
                                              case turns solely or substantially 
                                              upon the basic question whether 
                                              one was married or otherwise. It 
                                              was thought worthwhile undertaking 
                                              a project of this nature and with 
                                              apologies to the informants 
                                              therefore, further inquiries were 
                                              directed at finding out how their 
                                              marriages were contracted. As said 
                                              before, answers produced a dilemma 
                                              in the sense that it showed a 
                                              clear discrepancy between what 
                                              most informants thought 
                                              constituted marriage and what the 
                                              courts hold out to be such 
                                              marriages in law. The obvious 
                                              question that came to mind was, 
                                              what was the nature and cause of 
                                              this discrepancy? Whose position 
                                              is the better one—the courts or 
                                              the informants? And has the 
                                              divergence arisen because of 
                                              ignorance or prejudice by one 
                                              party? Or is it simply because, as 
                                              so often happens, the social 
                                              situation has changed but the law 
                                              has lagged behind? </span></p>

                                              parties themselves. The only 
                                              problem we can foresee arising 
                                              here is in regard to that nebulous 
                                              marriage called betrothals 
                                              especially and as often is the 
                                              practice, where a young girl is 
                                              given in marriage to an older 
                                              person. Such girls of course are 
                                              too young to give consent one way 
                                              or the other and it does not help 
                                              much to use legal contractual 
                                              principles to say that if she 
                                              attains the age of majority and 
                                              does not repudiate the marriage, 
                                              she must be deemed to have 
                                              affirmed the marriage. The 
                                              customary law had no such age 
                                              requirement even though specific 
                                              modern enactments now forbid such 
                                              practices11 and in any case, even 
                                              in their absence, the courts can 
                                              on their own annul such marriages 
                                              on public policy grounds if a 
                                              party can show he was forced into 
                                              the marriage.12&nbsp; Apart from this, 
                                              one can safely infer the requisite

                                              parties living together. </span>

                                              It does not appear that any case 
                                              has directly pronounced on the 
                                              consent by one or both families of

                                              But even in examining the cases, 
                                              such parental or family consent is 
                                              strangely noticeably never argued. 
                                              Were parental consent to be a true 
                                              legal essential, it should be 
                                              strenuously argued by or for the 
                                              party in whose favour such issue 
                                              was raised when the opportunity 
                                              presented itself. This however 
                                              does not seem to be the case. 
                                              Typical of this is the case of 
                                              Asumah v. Khair.15 There a girl 
                                              who had a valid subsisting 
                                              marriage deserted her first 
                                              husband and came to live openly 
                                              with the defendant, becoming 
                                              pregnant by him. The plaintiff 
                                              here was the girl's father and he 
                                              sued the defendant for seduction. 
                                              This of course implicitly ruled 
                                              out his ever consenting to the 
                                              defendant's alleged marriage to 
                                              the girl. The court nevertheless 
                                              went ahead to find a customary 
                                              marriage between the defendant and 
                                              the girl proved. It is not so much 
                                              the result of the case that 
                                              interests us here as the curious 
                                              but significant omission with 
                                              regard to consent. For the 
                                              question of parental consent was 
                                              silently passed over by the 
                                              plaintiff, by the defendant and by 
                                              the court. Is parental consent a 
                                              legal essential then? </span></p>

                                              of any such requirement. On the 
                                              contrary, it seems that even in 
                                              earlier times when parental 
                                              authority and influence over their 
                                              wards was unquestionably greater, 
                                              parties sui juris could validly 
                                              marry in the absence of such 
                                              consents. This they could do even 
                                              if parental consent had been 
                                              refused for in that event, they 
                                              could agree to marry before

                                              and more explicit repudiation of

                                              Today's observable social fact 
                                              also points to the conclusion that 
                                              parental consent amounts to no 
                                              more than the passive 
                                              ratifications of a 
                                              relationship—marriage—that is a 
                                              fait accompli for all intents and 
                                              purposes. This is often the case 
                                              if the spouses live in the cities 
                                              and towns while their parents live 
                                              in the rural areas. For in that 
                                              event as many informants narrated 
                                              during this project, lady and 
                                              gentleman take each other for 
                                              husband and wife and then visit 
                                              their villages to &quot;introduce&quot; 
                                              their husbands or wives as the 
                                              case may be, to their respective 
                                              parents. The situation does not 
                                              seem much different in the rural 
                                              areas according to research 
                                              recently done in Kwahu by a Dutch 
                                              anthropologist.19&nbsp; The conclusion 
                                              therefore seems inescapable that 
                                              it is an adult person's right to 
                                              conduct all the necessary 
                                              negotiations for his marriage 
                                              without the knowledge or consent 
                                              of his parents or family even if 
                                              the right is seldom exercised. And 
                                              here we reach accord with the then 
                                              Chief Justice Osborne when in a 
                                              similar situation he said, &quot;I am

                                              family is a legal essential to his 
                                              marriage.&quot;20</span></p>

                                              consideration21 for it seems to be 
                                              general among African peoples that 
                                              some kind of property passes to 
                                              the woman's family on the coming 
                                              into effect of the marriage. What 
                                              concerns us here however is the 
                                              nature and legal significance of 
                                              the transaction. Some authors seem 
                                              to have erected this into an 
                                              inflexible requirement, indeed a 
                                              sine qua non to the conclusion of 
                                              a customary marriage.22&nbsp; While it 
                                              may be common practice and is 
                                              important, the question is whether 
                                              failure to give drinks invalidates 
                                              a marriage. As one of the 
                                              &quot;essentials&quot; of a valid marriage 
                                              listed in Yaotey v. Quaye, one 
                                              might too readily be tempted to 
                                              answer in the affirmative. It was 
                                              found in the modest research for 
                                              this work that many apparently 
                                              valid marriages in Ghana today 
                                              would fail if this were the 
                                              position for in many of them, no 
                                              drinks have been given or 
                                              received. </span></p>

                                              But is that the true position? To 
                                              talk of prevailing social 
                                              circumstances and practice first, 
                                              we see that occasions for 
                                              gift-giving are numerous in the 
                                              marriage relationship for the

                                              difficulty however is whether any 
                                              meaningful distinction can be 
                                              drawn between the presentation of 
                                              drinks meant to be a dowry or 
                                              bride-price to satisfy this 
                                              so-called essential and the other 
                                              occasions for gift-giving which 
                                              may be merely desirable. Is the 
                                              distinguishing mark of the 
                                              &quot;dowry-drink&quot; to be that of the

                                              has to accompany it? We would only 
                                              say here that if in the past 
                                              formality was the norm, such 
                                              occasions are the exceptions 
                                              today. If the drink is to be 
                                              distinguished by its specificity, 
                                              it runs into a different problem. 
                                              For customarily, there has always 
                                              been a fixed scale of fees or 
                                              payments by people, mainly 
                                              according to their position of 
                                              life, to different recipients in 
                                              the bride's family in accordance 
                                              with the latters' relation to the 
                                              bride.23&nbsp; If today a sum of money 
                                              is given to the family as is 
                                              invariably done, is the donor to

                                              &quot;essential drink&quot; and therefore 
                                              that it should be distributed in 
                                              accordance with custom? Is it the 
                                              old customary scales that apply or 
                                              has a new tier of scales arisen 
                                              which though not having roots deep 
                                              in antiquity is easily 
                                              ascertainable and stable enough to 
                                              be accorded legal recognition?

                                              An examination of the opinions of 
                                              writers also shows that the 
                                              payment of drinks is not a legal 
                                              necessity in bringing the 
                                              customary marriage into effect. 
                                              Again the illustrious Sarbah 
                                              mentions that payment to the

                                              to the means of the prospective 
                                              groom and that among the &quot;poorer

                                              we find that among the six 
                                              different forms of marriage he saw 
                                              in Ashanti was what he thought at

                                              and common form of marriage today 
                                              as people more and more assert

                                              in this type of marriage, no

                                              then that drinks be a legal

                                              At common law, non-consummation of 
                                              the marriage due to impotence is 
                                              ground for nullity.31 Should 
                                              non-consummation of a customary 
                                              marriage have the same 
                                              consequence? Here, inferring from 
                                              the fact that our society, typical 
                                              of all developing societies, 
                                              placed so much on having children, 
                                              and that inability to have 
                                              children was, and still is, a 
                                              ground for divorce,32 one may 
                                              conclude that impotence or 
                                              frigidity would incapacitate 
                                              persons from marrying. What 
                                              however is not so clear is whether 
                                              it necessarily invalidated such 
                                              unions. We find no clear authority 
                                              on this point but whatever the 
                                              position might have been in the 
                                              past, we urge that it should not 
                                              invalidate customary marriages 
                                              today. We reach this conclusion on 
                                              the basis that marriage today 
                                              should not be viewed in terms of 
                                              procreation only. The satisfaction 
                                              of the spouses from their mutual 
                                              companionship, we conclude, is as 
                                              worthy a cause as any other.

                                              Heroic efforts are sometimes made

                                              marriages where perhaps the

                                              effected seems labour well lost. 
                                              Is it from the time when the 
                                              consent of parents is given or the 
                                              drinks offered and received 
                                              forgetting for the moment the

                                              payment of drinks can by agreement 
                                              be postponed and the union in the 
                                              meantime would be perfectly 
                                              legal.35&nbsp; Such argument however 
                                              fails to consider whether the 
                                              marriage becomes invalidated when 
                                              the bridegroom later expressly 
                                              repudiates the obligation to pay. 
                                              A situation like that arising, is 
                                              the invalidity then ab initio,

                                              the repudiation of the obligation

                                              difficulties the best approach 
                                              here undoubtedly seems to point to 
                                              one conclusion—that we do not have 
                                              to decide any precise point of 
                                              time at which the marriage is 
                                              established. The only question 
                                              then becomes whether the parties 
                                              were married at the relevant time 
                                              and then it is sufficient to 
                                              decide that upon the facts the 
                                              marriage had been established

                                              The great question still begging

                                              that in the formation of the

                                              Considering our discussions so far 
                                              it is evident that new directions 
                                              are called for. The so-called 
                                              &quot;essentials&quot; are not only obsolete 
                                              in today's circumstances, they are 
                                              likely to cause mischief by 
                                              misleading the courts into looking 
                                              for evidence which is irrelevant 
                                              and correspondingly disregarding 
                                              that which is appropriate. What 
                                              then are the alternatives? We must 
                                              proceed cautiously here for we are 
                                              on slippery grounds. Considering 
                                              that the society is in a state of 
                                              flux, that the administrative 
                                              machinery is rudimentary and weak 
                                              and that there is rampant 
                                              illiteracy among the bulk of the 
                                              population, radical suggestions 
                                              looking towards legislation might 
                                              only end up as dead statutes in 
                                              the books. Even a mild suggestion 
                                              such as that marriages be required 
                                              to be registered at the 
                                              appropriate district or local 
                                              council headquarters or even with 
                                              traditional chiefs of the various 
                                              ethnic communities throws up many 
                                              problems. It may be true that 
                                              registration has been advocated in 
                                              many instances because it 
                                              facilitates proof of the existence 
                                              of a marriage. Indeed as Philips

                                              &quot;Among the reasons advanced for 
                                              registration, perhaps the most 
                                              common is the need to facilitate 
                                              proof of marriage. Thus a proposal 
                                              for registration which was adopted 
                                              by the Ashanti Confederacy Council 
                                              in 1942 seems to have been 
                                              supported mainly on the ground 
                                              that it would 'enable the native 
                                              courts to decide without any waste 
                                              of time as to whether the union 
                                              between the man and the woman is 
                                              strictly in accord with native law 
                                              and custom, when another man is 
                                              accused of adultery with the

                                              What however will be the true 
                                              significance of such registration? 
                                              Does non-registration affect 
                                              validity? In other words, would 
                                              the provisions be held mandatory 
                                              or only regulatory or directory? 
                                              We would say that instead of 
                                              putting the obligation on the 
                                              citizens at the risk of rejecting 
                                              good marriages for non-compliance 
                                              with certain legislative 
                                              provisions, wise counsel would 
                                              suggest that we place it where it 
                                              is likely to cause the least

                                              for the use of the courts is to 
                                              treat every such determination as 
                                              a matter of proof. In this

                                              then be a matter of evidence

                                              conduct of the parties and such 
                                              other circumstances as usually 
                                              accompany the marriage relation. 
                                              The one big argument against this 
                                              approach is the lack of certainty 
                                              it might breed. We agree that 
                                              although it may be good public 
                                              policy that a public record be 
                                              kept of marriages and that that 
                                              policy may be defeated by the 
                                              method we are advocating, it is an 
                                              equally or better public policy 
                                              also to promote, and encourage and 
                                              uphold marriage among others. A 
                                              record of marriage is not an end 
                                              in itself but a means towards 
                                              social order and surely it is not 
                                              wise to defeat social order for 
                                              the sake of orderliness in 
                                              method.45&nbsp; Therefore, the
