                                              ON the doctrine of separation of 
                                              powers,1 Professor Richard 
                                              Neustadt has remarked that, “The 
                                              constitutional convention of 1787 
                                              is supposed to have created a 
                                              government of ‘separated powers’. 
                                              It did nothing of the sort. Rather 
                                              it created a government of 
                                              separated institutions, sharing 
                                              powers.”2 Of course, the powers 
                                              here referred to are no other than 
                                              the executive, legislative and 
                                              judicial powers of the state, the 
                                              separability of which has, since 
                                              the writings of John Locke and the 
                                              eighteenth century political and 
                                              legal philosophers, gained such 
                                              recognition that the crucial 
                                              question to be answered, since 
                                              then when it came to writing 
                                              constitutions, has been how much 
                                              separation is desirable. Thus when 
                                              in 1966, the Constitutional 
                                              Commission in Ghana (commonly 
                                              called Akufo-Addo Commission) was 
                                              directed by its terms of reference 
                                              to:</span></p>

                                              therefore quite remarkable that,

                                              independent. The commission, no 
                                              doubt, shared the view of modern

                                              Constitution, 1969, which followed 
                                              the Akufo-Addo Commission, stopped

                                              This was understandable, for by

                                              ex-British dependencies. There

                                              the executive), to assume the new

                                              separation have suggested, there

                                              Legislation is of course the best 
                                              known function of Parliament. But 
                                              important as this function is to 
                                              Parliament; as has been rightly 
                                              pointed out,20 &quot;the usual term 
                                              'legislature' is one indication of 
                                              the exaggeration of the law-making 
                                              functions of assemblies.&quot; Properly 
                                              speaking, the legislative function 
                                              is just an extension of 
                                              Parliament's broad function of 
                                              influencing the executive. 
                                              Nevertheless, there is no doubt 
                                              that, it is the legislative 
                                              function by which Parliament is 
                                              intended to exercise the greatest 
                                              check on the President. In a 
                                              constitutional system based on 
                                              &quot;laws and not of men&quot; as Chief 
                                              Justice Marshal once described the 
                                              American Constitution, the 
                                              overwhelming majority of executive 
                                              decisions are normally carried out 
                                              by some form of legislation, and 
                                              in the United States, where, as in 
                                              Ghana, the President is not even 
                                              part of the legislature, over 75 
                                              per centum of all laws passed 
                                              during any session are initiated 
                                              by the executive. That this has 
                                              been possible notwithstanding the 
                                              independence of the U.S. Congress, 
                                              has been attributed to the 
                                              elaborate system of consultation 
                                              and co-operation which has been 
                                              built up over the years, between 
                                              the President and the 
                                              Congressional leaders. Indeed, as 
                                              has been pointed out,21 &quot;in no 
                                              other country has the legislature 
                                              so much capacity for acting 
                                              independently and for thwarting 
                                              the will of the executive as in 
                                              the United States.&quot; In Ghana, the 
                                              President's effectiveness in 
                                              legislative matters, is, however, 
                                              expected to be further enhanced by 
                                              the constitutional requirement 
                                              contained in article 88(14) that,

                                              of discretion which would have 
                                              otherwise been left to the 
                                              parliamentary committees in this

                                              Since the President and his 
                                              Cabinet are not members of 
                                              Parliament, theoretically, there

                                              Parliament. In the United States, 
                                              this theoretical difficulty is 
                                              resolved by the simplification of

                                              of bills. There, a bill is deemed 
                                              to be introduced once it is 
                                              dropped into the box assigned for 
                                              that purpose, after which it is 
                                              referred to a committee by the 
                                              Speaker of the house or, as the 
                                              case may be, by the presiding 
                                              officer in the Senate. Thereafter, 
                                              strictly speaking, the bill 
                                              becomes the property of the house. 
                                              This latter fact is brought home

                                              bill.&quot; In previous Parliaments, 
                                              the need for a formal introduction 
                                              of bills arose really at the 
                                              second reading when &quot;upon the 
                                              motion&quot; that this bill be now read 
                                              a second time the member 
                                              introducing the bill stated its 
                                              principle and general merits. 
                                              &quot;Second Reading is the most 
                                              important stage in the passage of 
                                              a Bill.&quot;26 Both the mover and the 
                                              seconder of the motion then speak 
                                              for the motion. Thus, the 
                                              provisions of article 88(4) and 
                                              (5), noted above, appear to make 
                                              the need, and even the usefulness, 
                                              of the provision enabling a 
                                              minister to introduce a bill most 
                                              doubtful if not merely 
                                              confusing,27 for strictly 
                                              speaking, it is the chairman of 
                                              the committee from which a bill is 
                                              reported who will give the bill an 
                                              introduction when reporting to the

                                              financial bills be prefaced by an 
                                              explanatory memorandum. It is 
                                              important to note here the reasons 
                                              given by the 1966 Constitutional 
                                              Commission whose proposals on this 
                                              were adopted in the 1969 
                                              Constitution from which the 
                                              present article 88(2) originated.

                                              memoranda would not have qualified

                                              separation of powers Parliament 
                                              enjoys a fixed term of five years 
                                              and it is required by article 
                                              93(2) that a session be held at

                                              which simply means that Parliament

                                              no doubt, the reason for the 
                                              general rule that members of 
                                              Parliament should be excluded from

                                              of the public trustee. Admittedly,

                                              Apart from legislation, perhaps 
                                              the most effective check the 
                                              legislature can exercise over the

                                              Indeed the two powers sometimes 
                                              coincide to the extent to which 
                                              the supply power is itself 
                                              expected to be exercised by 
                                              legislation. The supply power may 
                                              however, be broken down into three

                                              the Clerk, but by a separate 
                                              officer called the 
                                              Parliamentarian. In addition 
                                              congressmen are given such 
                                              privileges as free postage, free 
                                              printing for speeches, and 
                                              allowances for stationery, 
                                              long-distance telephone, telegrams

                                              In Ghana, even if parliamentarians 
                                              need not be given power to hire 
                                              assistants paid from their 
                                              personal allocation of funds, it 
                                              should be possible for Parliament 
                                              to provide them with the services 
                                              of personal staff in whose

                                              The chief concern, in the light of 
                                              what has been noted above in 
                                              connection with the role of 
                                              professional staff, is, however, 
                                              with the omission both in the 
                                              Constitution itself, and in the 
                                              Standing Orders, setting out the 
                                              current internal organisation of 
                                              the house, to provide for the 
                                              full-time professional services of

                                              is expected by the Constitution to 
                                              make laws independently of the 
                                              executive branch, the means by 
                                              which that task is to be carried 
                                              out, has been left so much to 
                                              chance that Parliament has felt 
                                              able to decide to depend, after 
                                              all, on the executive branch, in 
                                              at least one important aspect of

                                              the determination of the question 
                                              as to whether there has been due

                                              by article 88(2)(b) of the

                                              subject to control by the 
                                              executive branch. How 
                                              independently can Parliament be 
                                              said to be carrying out its 
                                              legislative functions when in such 
                                              a crucial a matter as the 
                                              determination of a constitutional 
                                              condition precedent to the 
                                              performance of its task, it has to 
                                              await the judgment of an official 
                                              of the executive branch over whom 
                                              it has no control? This, of 
                                              course, is constitutionally and 
                                              even practically, indefensible. So 
                                              also Order 178 (1) which purports

                                              Chairman may direct.&quot; Under 
                                              article 74 of the Constitution, 
                                              the Attorney-General and any of 
                                              his officers, for that matter, are 
                                              principally legal officers of the 
                                              executive branch who cannot 
                                              therefore be involved either 
                                              intimately or officially in the 
                                              legislative process in Parliament 
                                              not even at the investigative 
                                              stage before a committee. It is 
                                              true that under article 74(2) the 
                                              Attorney-General can be assigned 
                                              &quot;duties of a legal nature.&quot; But it 
                                              is submitted that the nature of 
                                              his relationship to the executive 
                                              precludes the extension of his 
                                              services to the sort of role being 
                                              assigned him under the Standing 
                                              Orders. Admittedly, the situation 
                                              would be different if he were 
                                              summoned as a witness, for which 
                                              Parliament has the power of 
                                              subpoena, or where Parliament 
                                              wishes to refer any case to him 
                                              for prosecution. In the latter 
                                              case, article 74 (3) may support 
                                              such course of action.</span></p>

                                              restating the American Bill of

                                              acceptability. The choice for the 
                                              ready-made model, in the event, 
                                              fell on the Uganda Constitution of 
                                              1967 which provided the basic 
                                              model for the Ghana Constitution 
                                              of 1969, a fact, which contrary to 
                                              all expectations, has never been 
                                              acknowledged anywhere, despite the 
                                              copious explanatory memoranda, 
                                              which accompanied both the 
                                              original Ghanaian draft in 1968 
                                              and the 1978 revised version. The 
                                              1978 Constitutional Commission, on 
                                              the other hand, has indicated 
                                              throughout the memorandum the 
                                              close similarity between its draft 
                                              and the 1969 Constitution. Perhaps 
                                              the disability of the 1967 Uganda 
                                              Constitution is its stormy 
                                              historical background. It was the 
                                              product of what has been held by 
                                              the Uganda courts to be a civilian 
                                              coup d'etat staged by the then 
                                              Prime Minister Milton Obote. After 
                                              arbitrarily suspending the Uganda 
                                              Independence Constitution, he put 
                                              in its place the 1966 Constitution 
                                              which was the direct forebear of 
                                              the 1967 Constitution. This 
                                              background is doubtlessly well 
                                              known to the draftsman to the 
                                              Akufo-Addo Commission who served 
                                              as First Parliamentary Counsel in 
                                              Uganda up to about the time of the 
                                              constitutional crisis in Uganda. 
                                              He has also played a leading role 
                                              in the drafting of the present 
                                              Constitution which unhappily has 
                                              retained the provisions which form 
                                              the subject of Professor Gunther's 
                                              comment referred to in note 33 
                                              below. The final irony was that 
                                              both the 1967 Constitution of 
                                              Uganda and its 1969 counterpart in 
                                              Ghana were overthrown within a 
                                              short time of each other. An 
                                              acknowledgement of the source of a 
                                              statutory provision is standard 
                                              practice in the memorandum on such 
                                              provision, since it sometimes 
                                              serves as an aid to interpretation 
                                              in case of doubt.32 Indeed serious 
                                              questions of doubt have been 
                                              raised against the Ghanaian Bill 
                                              of Rights provisions by Professor 
                                              Gunther who apparently did not 
                                              know that they were borrowed from 
                                              the Uganda Constitution33:</span></p>

                                              detailed, to be sure. But the 
                                              language remains broad indeed. 
                                              What are 'the interests of 
                                              defence, public safety, public 
                                              order, public morality or public

                                              expression? When do those 
                                              interests 'reasonably require' 
                                              restriction? And if giving content 
                                              to these broad phrases were not 
                                              assurance enough of broad judicial 
                                              responsibility, the concluding 
                                              language ... emphasises the 
                                              immense judicial scope: the 
                                              restrictive law must not only be 
                                              'reasonably required' by the 
                                              stated interests, but must also be 
                                              shown 'to be reasonably 
                                              justifiable in terms of the spirit

                                              The Uganda Constitution of 1967 
                                              and its Ghanaian counterpart of 
                                              1969, were of course, framed for a 
                                              parliamentary form of government, 
                                              and could not therefore have 
                                              catered for the special deeds of 
                                              an independent legislature, among 
                                              which is the office of legislative 
                                              counsel. Indeed the Ghanaian 
                                              Constitution, 1979, could have 
                                              provided for this among its real 
                                              innovations and in full 
                                              recognition of the fact that no 
                                              legislature can, today, perform 
                                              efficiently by itself, let alone, 
                                              independently of the executive, 
                                              without its own legislative 
                                              counselling services. The omission 
                                              is even more regrettable having 
                                              regard to the detailed provisions 
                                              made elsewhere in the Constitution 
                                              to cater for similar circumstances 
                                              in respect of the judiciary and 
                                              the Judicial Service and 
                                              specifically for the appointment 
                                              of counsel to assist regional 
                                              chieftaincy tribunals. Worse 
                                              still, it is to be noted that the 
                                              newly enacted Parliamentary 
                                              Service Act, 1980 (Act 431),

                                              In this regard, it is perhaps 
                                              necessary to mention that although 
                                              it took a long time for the United 
                                              States Congress to recognise the 
                                              need for a legislative counsel,34 
                                              the main reason was the fact that 
                                              legislative counselling is a very 
                                              recent development in 
                                              institutional legal practice the 
                                              first Office of Parliamentary 
                                              Counsel being established in 
                                              Britain only a century ago in 
                                              1869. Nevertheless, the office of 
                                              parliamentary counsel, has been an 
                                              established post of relatively 
                                              long standing in Ghana. Under 
                                              previous Constitutions, when the 
                                              executive was the most important 
                                              factor in the initiation and 
                                              passage of legislation, due 
                                              recognition was given to a 
                                              centralised office of 
                                              Parliamentary Counsel in the law 
                                              office of the Civil Service.35&nbsp; 
                                              Now that situation has changed 
                                              giving Parliament a more important 
                                              role in legislation, all that is 
                                              being urged here is for the 
                                              corresponding adjustments to be 
                                              made so that Parliament may have 
                                              its fair share of the necessary 
                                              professional support required for 
                                              that role. The need for this 
                                              adjustment is all the more 
                                              imperative, because of the 
                                              additional need for professional 
                                              legal advice which Parliament may 
                                              even feel with regard to the 
                                              scrutiny of delegated or 
                                              subsidiary legislation from the 
                                              executive branch. Because of 
                                              conflict of interest, Parliament 
                                              cannot rely on the law officers of 
                                              the executive branch in this 
                                              matter. Similarly there is no way 
                                              by which Parliament can exercise 
                                              the exclusive power which the 
                                              Constitution has conferred on it, 
                                              over certain categories of 
                                              legislation other than having its 
                                              own legal drafting services. 
                                              Generally, where the source of the 
                                              legislative power is expressed in 
                                              terms of an &quot;Act of Parliament&quot; it 
                                              is settled that this confers 
                                              concurrent jurisdiction for the 
                                              legislative initiative on both 
                                              Parliament and the executive 
                                              branch, and that in any other 
                                              case, Parliament has exclusive 
                                              jurisdiction, which it may 
                                              exercise through the appropriate 
                                              committee responsible for the 
                                              subject-matter of the 
                                              legislation.36 Notable among the 
                                              categories of legislation over 
                                              which Parliament has exclusive 
                                              jurisdiction are:</span></p>

                                              The case for the remedy suggested 
                                              for the current operational 
                                              inadequacies of Parliament is, 
                                              however, not complete, without the 
                                              caution that the recruitment of 
                                              staff for the office of 
                                              parliamentary counsel is not an 
                                              easy one. One of the problems of 
                                              recruitment, namely, the problem 
                                              of adequate remuneration, was 
                                              discussed in an earlier article.38</span></p>

                                              In that article, it was argued 
                                              that if autonomy was the only way 
                                              out of the problem of adequate

                                              Parliamentary Service, this should 
                                              not preclude the parliamentary 
                                              counsel earning an equal or even a 
                                              higher salary than that of the 
                                              clerk especially where the 
                                              parliamentary counsel's office is 
                                              given the necessary autonomy. The 
                                              work of parliamentary counselling 
                                              is still a Cinderella job, even 
                                              within the legal profession, which 
                                              further aggravates the problems. 
                                              Good remuneration and sound career 
                                              prospects are therefore the 
                                              essential ingredients of a scheme 
                                              of service likely to attract and 
                                              retain the staff for this type of 
                                              legal practice which is still 
                                              obscure in many countries. 
                                              Certainly the situation can be 
                                              further improved if it were 
                                              possible to introduce law students 
                                              to the art of legislative 
                                              counselling through a course or 
                                              seminar equal in status to the 
                                              civil procedure course taught in 
                                              most law faculties.39 Such a 
                                              course or seminar, may also be 
                                              taken as a component of a 
                                              comprehensive study of 
                                              constitutional law or separately 
                                              as an advanced or specialist study 
                                              of constitutional law in the area 
                                              of the legislature, legislation 
                                              and the legislative process. 
                                              Indeed, the Commonwealth 
                                              Secretariat has recently sponsored 
                                              a series of new programmes in 
                                              institutional teaching of 
                                              legislative drafting. These, have

                                              curriculum and might not achieve 
                                              the desired objective. Indeed, a 
                                              general assessment of the impact 
                                              of these latter programmes with 
                                              regard to stimulating interest in 
                                              legislative drafting, should be 
                                              instructive and may even be said 
                                              to be long overdue.</span></p>

                                              It has been the object of this 
                                              article to highlight the 
                                              historical background to the 
                                              choice of a complete separation of 
                                              powers as a system of government 
                                              in Ghana, the new role which 
                                              Parliament is expected to play in 
                                              that system and the extent to 
                                              which the new Constitution, 1979, 
                                              has been able to accommodate the 
                                              necessary changes. In the process 
                                              a brief examination of the 
                                              operation in Ghana of the cabinet 
                                              or parliamentary form of 
                                              government, otherwise known as the 
                                              Westminster Model, was undertaken, 
                                              with the caution that the 
                                              departure from that form of 
                                              government after nearly a quarter 
                                              of a century would be, for both 
                                              the executive and a populace 
                                              accustomed to the role of 
                                              Parliament as only a rubber-stamp 
                                              and a tool for carrying out the 
                                              orders of the executive, as hard 
                                              as the death of old habits. Hence 
                                              the special care that ought to 
                                              have been taken in drafting the 
                                              Constitution, 1979, to equip 
                                              Parliament adequately to assume 
                                              its new role with as little pain 
                                              as possible.</span></p>

                                              1. While in political philosophy, 
                                              the term “doctrine” has passed 
                                              without question, the modern view 
                                              of the written constitution more 
                                              as law rather than as the mere 
                                              statement of directive principles, 
                                              would seem to support viewing 
                                              separation of powers as a legal 
                                              principle underlying the very 
                                              operation of the constitution and

                                              6. The Union Government (Unigov) 
                                              Affair started quite innocuously 
                                              with a call in 1976 by the late 
                                              then General I. K. Acheampong, 
                                              Head of State, for a new form of 
                                              government in which party politics 
                                              were to be abolished in the 
                                              interest of national unity. But 
                                              the suppression and intimidation 
                                              of opponents of the government’s 
                                              stand that characterised the 
                                              campaign for the referendum on the 
                                              issue, later confirmed the fears 
                                              of many that the whole affair was 
                                              meant to perpetuate military 
                                              influence in Ghanaian politics. 
                                              Our main concern here however, is 
                                              with the special issue which the 
                                              protagonists took with the 
                                              Westminster Model or form of

                                              at independence in 1957, given by 
                                              Britain, a constitution based, as 
                                              a matter of course, on the 
                                              Westminster Model. Since then,

                                              has been used to describe the 
                                              political systems of the Fourth 
                                              French Republic and post-war Italy 
                                              in which under the form of 
                                              parliamentary system practised, 
                                              governments were brought down so 
                                              often by adverse vote in 
                                              Parliament, that no governing was 
                                              actually possible. Applied to the 
                                              presidential system, the fears of 
                                              “executive immobilism” can be 
                                              justified only to the extent to 
                                              which Parliament can so succeed in 
                                              obstructing the executive that the 
                                              latter cannot have any governing

                                              that this discretionary power did 
                                              not affect the principle of

                                              Cabinet and therefore in cases 
                                              referred to it, it was the cabinet
