                                              THIS book is written by the 
                                              Director of the Nigerian Institute 
                                              of Advanced Legal Studies who was 
                                              formerly the Chief Judge of Ondo 
                                              State, formerly Chief Justice of 
                                              Botswana and formerly Judge of the 
                                              High Court of the Western State of 
                                              Nigeria.&nbsp; It is primarily for 
                                              practitioners; for it is the 
                                              “result of a deep-rooted desire on 
                                              (his) part that someone should 
                                              produce a book for the use of the 
                                              courts and the legal practitioners 
                                              in the area of practice and 
                                              procedure in civil matters before 
                                              the Superior Courts of Nigeria.” 
                                              The book is one of considerable 
                                              “magnitude and complexity.” But 
                                              that, let me add quickly, is not 
                                              because of the style of the author 
                                              or the arrangement of the 
                                              material.&nbsp; It is primarily because 
                                              of&nbsp; the political history of the 
                                              country with which it deals. There 
                                              are “20 different High Courts—19 
                                              State High Courts and one Federal 
                                              High Court—with 20 different Rules 
                                              of Civil Procedure.”</span></p>

                                              Nevertheless, Dr. Aguda has by 
                                              careful analysis grouped the Rules 
                                              into six sets and shown how to 
                                              find one’s way through all of 
                                              them, allowing for important 
                                              variations throughout.&nbsp; He rightly 
                                              draws attention to the importance 
                                              of “Chapter 1 which may be 
                                              regarded as the key to its use.” 
                                              That introduction explains the 
                                              historical milieu which threw up 
                                              the many courts of Nigeria. But 
                                              there are 70 other chapters in the 
                                              book.&nbsp; Each is divided into 
                                              short-numbered paragraphs and it 
                                              is these that state the Rules and 
                                              comment on them. This makes the 
                                              book easy to read and convenient 
                                              to use, especially because 
                                              adequate cross-references are 
                                              provided.</span></p>

                                              The comments on these Rules are 
                                              particularly helpful. Any young 
                                              practitioner will understand not 
                                              only how to bring his case within 
                                              any rule but also the principles 
                                              underlying any apparently 
                                              complicated twist in its 
                                              statement. And the experienced 
                                              practitioner will find these 
                                              concise explanations helpful. 
                                              Examples taken at random are the 
                                              sections on form and commencement 
                                              of action, parties, affidavits, 
                                              injunctions, declaratory 
                                              judgments, judicial review and 
                                              contempt of court.&nbsp; Some of these 
                                              comments are of course taken from 
                                              the English Supreme Court 
                                              Practice. But the necessary 
                                              adaptation has been carefully done 
                                              and local cases are given more 
                                              prominence than English ones—which 
                                              is quite proper.&nbsp; In most of

                                              paid to the provisions of the 
                                              present 1979 Constitution of 
                                              Nigeria; and where these have 
                                              introduced some doubt, that has 
                                              been frankly stated (see e.g. the 
                                              comment under “Jurisdiction of the 
                                              court to give declaratory

                                              The author points out at every 
                                              stage the matters that call for 
                                              special attention. All 
                                              practitioners in West Africa will 
                                              no doubt be interested in his 
                                              brief comments on filling briefs 
                                              of argument under the Rules that 
                                              came into force in Nigeria on 1 
                                              September 1977. This practice is 
                                              not common (except perhaps when we 
                                              had our appeals decided in the 
                                              English Privy Council).&nbsp; Its 
                                              merits are attractive; but not 
                                              many think that it will solve the 
                                              problems for which it is often 
                                              recommended. Perhaps in the next 
                                              edition Dr. Aguda may be persuaded 
                                              to make fuller comments and even 
                                              provide a precedent somewhere in 
                                              the appendix.</span></p>

                                              The section on the Supreme Court 
                                              does not contain many comments. 
                                              This is understandable, since the 
                                              Rules are new.&nbsp; A preliminary note 
                                              (chapter 62) however, gives an 
                                              explanation of the set up that is 
                                              very useful.&nbsp; After those Rules, 
                                              come the Court Forms fully

                                              of their use in some cases. The 
                                              relevant sections (212-227) of the 
                                              Constitution of the Federal 
                                              Republic of Nigeria, 1979, are 
                                              reproduced in Appendix IV; and 
                                              that is followed by the Legal

                                              concerned, if there is any 
                                              important matter that the author 
                                              has left it is “not wilful, and .

                                              special mention here; for they

                                              bound to be spotted some slips 
                                              here and there: For example, some 
                                              words have probably been omitted 
                                              from the sentence at page 6, para.

                                              the publishers who “goaded” him in
