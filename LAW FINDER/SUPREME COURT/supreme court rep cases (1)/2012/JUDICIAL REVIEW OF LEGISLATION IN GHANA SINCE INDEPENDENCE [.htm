                                              AT the outset, we may distinguish 
                                              between two forms in which 
                                              judicial review manifests itself: 
                                              The first situation occurs in a 
                                              constitutional scheme in which the 
                                              courts have or exert the power to 
                                              declare an enactment of the 
                                              legislature unconstitutional. 
                                              Usually its exercise is based on a 
                                              written, rigid constitution 
                                              changeable, if at all, only 
                                              through a complex process. The 
                                              second type is where a court 
                                              resorts to strict interpretation 
                                              of a piece of legislation. That is 
                                              to say, the court, while 
                                              professing to be interpreting the 
                                              enactment, puts on the legislation 
                                              an interpretation that frustrates 
                                              the legislature's intention.1 We 
                                              shall be concerned in this article 
                                              with only the former situation.</span></p>

                                              Judicial review of legislation is 
                                              predicated on the acceptance of 
                                              the primacy and inviolability of 
                                              certain legal principles. It 
                                              involves the creation of a 
                                              hierarchy of laws and the 
                                              conferment, on the judicial 
                                              branch, of the power to determine 
                                              and to maintain the hierarchy. 
                                              Thus the concept of judicial 
                                              review stems from a belief in the 
                                              rule of law; that is to say, a 
                                              belief that government should be 
                                              by laws, not of men. It is of 
                                              course possible to believe in the 
                                              rule of law and yet to deny courts 
                                              the power to determine the 
                                              constitutionality of the acts of 
                                              other branches of government. In 
                                              modern times, however, most 
                                              nations which adopt a written 
                                              constitution provide for judicial 
                                              review. For, in essence, judicial 
                                              review is an endeavour to judge 
                                              positive law in the light of 
                                              ultimate values.2</span></p>

                                              government has undoubtedly been 
                                              given great prominence by the work 
                                              of the Supreme Court of the United 
                                              States of America in modern times.

                                              actions of various organs of state 
                                              to &quot;higher principles,&quot; though

                                              there. As Professor Capelletti has 
                                              pointed out, judicial review in 
                                              the United States was the result 
                                              of &quot;centuries of European thought 
                                              and colonial experiences, which 
                                              had made western man in general 
                                              willing to admit the theoretical 
                                              primacy of certain kinds of law .

                                              review, as we know it today, first 
                                              took root effectively. The 
                                              Constitution of the United States, 
                                              or perhaps more accurately, Chief 
                                              Justice Marshall's interpretation 
                                              of it in the case of Marbury v. 
                                              Madison,4 initiated the era of 
                                              &quot;constitutionalism&quot; with the 
                                              notion of the supremacy of the 
                                              Constitution over ordinary laws.5</span></p>

                                              In Marbury v. Madison, Chief 
                                              Justice Marshall discussed the 
                                              issue of a limited government 
                                              evidenced by a written 
                                              constitution and the difference 
                                              between rigid and flexible 
                                              constitutions. It is evident, he 
                                              said, that either the constitution 
                                              prevails over legislative 
                                              enactments contrary to it, or the 
                                              legislature is able to change the 
                                              constitution by ordinary 
                                              legislation. Either the 
                                              constitution is the fundamental 
                                              law, superior and unchangeable by 
                                              ordinary means, or it is placed on 
                                              the same level as ordinary 
                                              legislative enactments and, as a 
                                              result, can be altered at will by 
                                              the legislative body. If the 
                                              former alternative is accepted, 
                                              then one must conclude that a 
                                              legislative enactment contrary to 
                                              the constitution is not law; if, 
                                              on the other hand, the second 
                                              alternative is chosen, written 
                                              constitutions are no more than 
                                              worthless attempts to limit a 
                                              power which by its very nature is 
                                              illimitable. Marshall's decision 
                                              can thus be considered as the 
                                              high-water mark of judicial 
                                              review. The power of the courts to 
                                              exercise judicial review is 
                                              postulated as flowing necessarily 
                                              from their duty of applying the 
                                              law. The supremacy clause of the 
                                              U.S. Constitution6 on which Chief 
                                              Justice Marshall based his 
                                              historic decision has therefore 
                                              been used as the source of the 
                                              supremacy of the constitutional 
                                              provisions over the acts of 
                                              Congress and the Executive and 
                                              also is the basis of the power and 
                                              duty of the judiciary to override 
                                              laws inconsistent with the 
                                              constitution.7</span></p>

                                              primary problem with judicial 
                                              review is deciding which organ to 
                                              vest with the power. Two solutions 
                                              are to be found variously in use: 
                                              namely, either to vest the power 
                                              in the ordinary courts or to 
                                              create a special constitutional 
                                              court. In the American system, the 
                                              regular courts perform the 
                                              function while in some European 
                                              countries, notably France and West 
                                              Germany, a special constitutional 
                                              tribunal has been set up outside 
                                              the regular court system to decide 
                                              on questions of constitutionality. 
                                              We may also distinguish two types 
                                              of the special constitutional 
                                              tribunals in use. In some 
                                              countries employing it, like West 
                                              Germany, this special tribunal, 
                                              though separated from the regular 
                                              courts, is a judicial body; in 
                                              others, exemplified by France, the 
                                              special tribunal, both in its 
                                              nature and composition, is a 
                                              political rather than a judicial 
                                              body. </span></p>

                                              Under the European systems the 
                                              invalidation of an enactment has 
                                              erga omnes effect while under the 
                                              American system a decision on a 
                                              constitutional question is 
                                              relevant only for the parties to 
                                              the dispute.8&nbsp; However, the 
                                              operation of stare decisis in the 
                                              common law tradition ensures that 
                                              in practice the difference in 
                                              effect between the two systems 
                                              disappears. When an enactment is 
                                              declared unconstitutional in the 
                                              United States, it ordinarily means 
                                              that the act is void ab initio. 
                                              Even though the enactment remains 
                                              on the statute book it is 
                                              considered &quot;dead law.&quot; In some 
                                              European systems, as for example, 
                                              Austria, the unconstitutional law 
                                              is considered voidable rather than 
                                              void. The enactment is valid until 
                                              the court expressly annuls it. The 
                                              question of the prior validity of 
                                              unconstitutional laws, remains in 
                                              practice a very thorny one. The 
                                              solution generally employed by the 
                                              Italian, West German and American 
                                              courts perhaps grapples with the 
                                              problems best in criminal cases 
                                              the laws are apt to be held 
                                              invalid ex tune, whereas in civil 
                                              cases their invalidity may not be 
                                              retroactive. </span></p>

                                              have no control. Judicial review, 
                                              so the argument continues, has the 
                                              effect of blunting the people's 
                                              vigilance in respect of their 
                                              rights since the courts then 
                                              become their conscience; this in 
                                              itself contains the seed of 
                                              destruction for democracy. 
                                              Democratic battles are not won in 
                                              the courts but in the legislatures 
                                              and arenas of public opinion. The 
                                              judiciary is accountable to no one 
                                              but itself. The fact that now and 
                                              again some of its judgments also 
                                              have the effect of furthering the 
                                              goals of democracy does not make 
                                              it escape the censure that it is 
                                              essentially undemocratic.</span></p>

                                              The protagonists of the 
                                              consistency of judicial review 
                                              counter by saying that democracy 
                                              should not be confused with 
                                              unchecked majoritarian rule, 
                                              unlimited government or 
                                              legislative sovereignty. Democracy 
                                              does not require policy decisions 
                                              to be made by bodies ever 
                                              sensitive to electoral sentiment. 
                                              History confirms that judicial 
                                              review has popular support and 
                                              therefore it is democratic. 
                                              Democracy does not require that 
                                              there should be a voting on all 
                                              major policy issues; neither is it 
                                              necessary in a democracy to elect 
                                              all the officers who exercise 
                                              crucial authority in the society. 
                                              The protagonists further contend 
                                              that judicial review is inherently 
                                              adapted to preserving broad and 
                                              flexible lines of constitutional 
                                              growth and maintaining a pluralist 
                                              equilibrium in society.</span></p>

                                              notes,10 the question whether

                                              may admit that judicial review 
                                              does appear a deviant growth on 
                                              pure democratic theory, it seems 
                                              perfectly arguable, as Bickle 
                                              does, that judicial review can and 
                                              does achieve &quot;some measure of 
                                              consonance . . . a tolerable 
                                              accommodation with the theory and 
                                              practice of democracy.&quot;11</span></p>

                                              Judicial review in Ghana can be 
                                              traced to the fact that before 
                                              independence, as was the case with 
                                              all British Colonial Territories, 
                                              the Privy Council exercised that

                                              colonies, English law was supreme. 
                                              The colonial legislatures were 
                                              subordinate to the English 
                                              Parliament. Often, the 
                                              Order-in-Council setting up these 
                                              legislative bodies provided that 
                                              they could pass laws only if they 
                                              were reasonable and not contrary

                                              Colonial laws were thus in theory

                                              was found inconsistent with a rule 
                                              of court which had been made under 
                                              an Order-in-Council, the rule of 
                                              court was held to prevail because 
                                              the Order-in-Council had provided 
                                              that the rules of court when made 
                                              were to be incorporated into the 
                                              Order-in-Council. At the time of

                                              strenuously for the Constitution 
                                              to provide safeguards for minority 
                                              interests. The safeguards included 
                                              giving to the courts the power to 
                                              review legislation to bring it 
                                              into conformity with the

                                              At independence, Ghana adopted the 
                                              institutional forms of British 
                                              parliamentary system. The 
                                              legislative power of the state was 
                                              vested in Parliament.16 The

                                              preservation of public order, 
                                              morality or health, no law could

                                              private property was subject to a 
                                              right of adequate compensation, to

                                              review in Ghana and United States 
                                              which was to become a permanent 
                                              feature of judicial review in 
                                              Ghana. In the United States, 
                                              questions of constitutionality are 
                                              dealt with by both state and 
                                              federal courts. Under the 1957 
                                              Constitution, however, questions 
                                              of constitutionality were made the 
                                              exclusive preserve of the Supreme 
                                              Court. Where the issue arose in 
                                              any lower court, the proceedings 
                                              were to be stayed until the 
                                              Supreme Court had dealt with the 
                                              constitutional issue. It may well 
                                              be that constitutional issues were 
                                              considered to be too important to 
                                              be adjudicated upon in every 
                                              court. This aspect of judicial 
                                              review would appear to group Ghana 
                                              with West Germany in the practice

                                              court of West Germany, though a 
                                              judicial body, is outside the

                                              Attorney-General (No. 2).23 Lardan

                                              challenging the order on the 
                                              grounds that he was a Ghanaian and 
                                              could not be&nbsp; deported.24 He asked 
                                              for an interim injunction to 
                                              prevent the government from 
                                              deporting him while he challenged 
                                              the order in the courts. The 
                                              injunction was granted but was 
                                              later discharged because of

                                              violated the 1957 Constitution as

                                              The learned judge rejected all the 
                                              three contentions. He was 
                                              satisfied that, notwithstanding 
                                              the form of the original 
                                              proceedings, substantially they 
                                              were aimed at attacking the 
                                              deportation orders made under the 
                                              Deportation Act, 1957. As regards 
                                              the contention that the 
                                              Deportation (Lardan and Amadu 
                                              Baba) Act, 1957, was 
                                              discriminatory and therefore 
                                              unconstitutional, the learned 
                                              judge pointed out that what was 
                                              prohibited by the Constitution was 
                                              legislation that was racially 
                                              discriminatory. He found nothing 
                                              within the Deportation (Lardan and 
                                              Amadu Baba) Act, 1957 to indicate 
                                              that the persons it concerned were 
                                              being discriminated against on 
                                              racial grounds. Consequently, he 
                                              found no merit in the argument 
                                              that the Act was caught by article 
                                              32(2) of the Constitution. 
                                              Finally, the learned judge held 
                                              that article 31 (1) which 
                                              empowered Parliament to make laws 
                                              for peace, order and good 
                                              government conferred plenary 
                                              powers the due exercise of which 
                                              could not be called in question 
                                              except by Parliament itself. After 
                                              a survey of the law in other 
                                              Commonwealth countries with 
                                              similar provisions in their 
                                              constitutions, the learned judge 
                                              concluded that the only 
                                              investigation that the courts 
                                              could validly embark upon was 
                                              whether the Act was duly passed. 
                                              If the result was in the 
                                              affirmative, it was not open to 
                                              the courts to decide whether the 
                                              Act in fact could be considered as 
                                              being conducive to peace, order 
                                              and good government.</span></p>

                                              The effect of the ruling was, of 
                                              course, that Lardan was left high 
                                              and dry. He was left with no 
                                              remedy; though it is arguable 
                                              perhaps that he could still have 
                                              brought an action for habeas 
                                              corpus. It is surprising that the 
                                              learned judge refused to go into 
                                              the question of whether the law 
                                              passed was for the peace, order 
                                              and good government of Ghana. He 
                                              seemed to have laboured under the 
                                              impression that the only grounds 
                                              on which an Act of Parliament 
                                              could have been attacked under the 
                                              1957 Constitution were (1) 
                                              procedural invalidity and (2) that 
                                              it was ultra vires the powers of 
                                              Parliament. He did not find his 
                                              duty, once he was satisfied of the 
                                              formal validity of an enactment, 
                                              as requiring him to inquire into

                                              except of course, to find out 
                                              whether the enactment contained 
                                              anything in violation of an

                                              behalf of the defendants that the 
                                              Act affected the traditional

                                              court also found that, whatever 
                                              might have been the historical 
                                              antecedents of the applicant, 
                                              there was no doubt that he was 
                                              holding a chiefly office at the 
                                              time of the action. As regards the 
                                              argument that the Act had been 
                                              passed for &quot;peace, order and good

                                              As far as the court was concerned 
                                              therefore the only criterion was 
                                              whether a Bill directly affected 
                                              the traditional functions and 
                                              privileges of a chief. If it did, 
                                              then the procedure laid down in 
                                              section 35 had to be followed, 
                                              whatever other purpose the 
                                              proposed legislation might have. 
                                              Applying this standard to the case 
                                              at hand, the court came to the 
                                              conclusion that the plaintiff was 
                                              entitled to his declaration.

                                              One final interesting observation 
                                              that can be made about the 1957 
                                              Constitution is its silence on the 
                                              judicial power of the State. 
                                              Nowhere in the Constitution does 
                                              one find a provision expressly 
                                              vesting this power in the 
                                              judiciary. Apart from article 31 
                                              (5) which gives the Supreme Court 
                                              original and exclusive

                                              document is surprisingly quiet 
                                              about the repository of the

                                              1960. The 1957 Independence 
                                              Constitution was repealed and a 
                                              new Constitution enacted in its 
                                              place. The power of judicial 
                                              review, however, was retained. The 
                                              relevant constitutional provisions 
                                              on judicial review were in 
                                              articles 41(2) and 42(2).&nbsp; Article 
                                              41 (2) vested the judicial power 
                                              of the State in the judiciary and 
                                              article 42 (2) gave the supreme 
                                              Court original jurisdiction to

                                              constitutionality. Article 55 (4) 
                                              extended this power of judicial

                                              pointed out by Rubin and Murray, 
                                              the words &quot;where the question

                                              must mean that the Supreme Court 
                                              can give neither advisory nor 
                                              speculative opinions.29 The same 
                                              authors also suggest that the 
                                              wording of article 42(2) limits 
                                              the Supreme Court's power of 
                                              judicial review to only the 
                                              enactments passed by the 
                                              Republican Parliament.30 They 
                                              argue that the power is to be 
                                              exercised where a question arises 
                                              &quot;whether an enactment was made in

                                              Constitution did not extend to

                                              the 1960 Constitution will be 
                                              dealt with fully when we come to

                                              been passed during peace time. 
                                              This contention will not be 
                                              discussed because it is the

                                              neither the wording nor the spirit 
                                              of the Constitution warranted such 
                                              a ground for determining 
                                              constitutionality. This contention 
                                              would therefore appear to have 
                                              been totally misconceived.</span></p>

                                              For the appellants, it was argued 
                                              that it is of the essence of 
                                              government under a written 
                                              constitution that the various 
                                              organs of state are limited in 
                                              their powers by the constitutional 
                                              document. The Parliament 
                                              established by the 1960 
                                              Constitution was therefore not 
                                              sovereign in the sense in which 
                                              that word is employed to 
                                              characterise the supremacy of the 
                                              British Parliament. Parliament in 
                                              the exercise of the legislative 
                                              power granted it under the 
                                              Constitution could not pass any 
                                              laws that contravened the 
                                              Constitution either expressly or 
                                              impliedly. Therefore in the 
                                              exercise of its legislative 
                                              powers, Parliament was subject to 
                                              the declaration of fundamental 
                                              principles embodied in article 
                                              13(1), as much as it was limited 
                                              by other provisions of the 
                                              Constitution. The P.D.A., however, 
                                              authorised the President,if he was 
                                              satisfied, to order the detention 
                                              of a person without trial. This, 
                                              in the contention of counsel for 
                                              the appellants, was an exercise of 
                                              judicial power by the legislature. 
                                              And yet article 41 (2) had vested 
                                              the judicial power of the state in 
                                              the courts. This purported 
                                              exercise of judicial power was 
                                              therefore invalid and the courts 
                                              must so hold. Besides, so counsel 
                                              for the appellants contended, the 
                                              P.D.A. provided for discrimination 
                                              against people for their political 
                                              views; it limited freedom of 
                                              speech, movement and 
                                              association—all important freedoms 
                                              which the President in his solemn 
                                              declaration under article 13 (1) 
                                              undertook to uphold. It was 
                                              therefore urged on the court to 
                                              rule the P.D.A. unconstitutional 
                                              because the President could not 
                                              have assented to an Act which was 
                                              clearly in violation of his solemn 
                                              constitutional undertaking.</span></p>

                                              number of arguments were also put 
                                              up on behalf of the Republic. Mr. 
                                              Geoffrey Bing, the 
                                              Attorney-General, argued 
                                              strenuously that the scope of 
                                              judicial review under the 1960 
                                              Constitution was not the same as 
                                              prevailed in other countries which 
                                              also had written constitutions. 
                                              This was because, in his 
                                              contention, the Republican 
                                              Parliament was sovereign. He 
                                              argued that the only limitation on 
                                              Parliament's power was to be found 
                                              in article 20.34 Therefore 
                                              examples of the practice of review 
                                              elsewhere should not be followed 
                                              in Ghana. Granted the supremacy of 
                                              Parliament, article 13 (1) could 
                                              not be said to limit it in any 
                                              way. In the contention of the

                                              the electorate. If the President

                                              set out in the declaration, the 
                                              people have a remedy, not through 
                                              the use of the courts but through

                                              terms of the Constitution but was 
                                              necessary for the maintenance of 
                                              constitutionalism in a country, 
                                              like Ghana, which was changing 
                                              from a state of dependence to 
                                              independence.</span></p>

                                              article 13 (1) limited the

                                              conflict with express provisions

                                              The only limitation on the 
                                              sovereignty of Parliament was to 
                                              be found in article 20. The

                                              form of a personal declaration by 
                                              the President and is in no way

                                              that the provisions of Article 13 
                                              (1) do not create legal

                                              impose on every President a moral

                                              The court thus rejected the broad 
                                              scope argued for brilliantly by 
                                              Dr. Danquah. Judicial review under 
                                              the 1960 Constitution would 
                                              therefore appear to have been 
                                              limited by the Supreme Court to 
                                              cases where a violation of article 
                                              20 of the Constitution could be 
                                              proved. It is submitted that it 
                                              was not necessary to so restrict 
                                              the scope of judicial review in 
                                              order to come to the specific 
                                              conclusion it reached in Re Akoto. 
                                              For it seems arguable that article 
                                              13 (1) did not give rise to any 
                                              justiciable rights. Even if some 
                                              of the provisions concern 
                                              fundamental human rights, the only 
                                              way these can be enforced is by a 
                                              selective process of a sort. But 
                                              the Constitution gave no guidance 
                                              as to how this selective process 
                                              was to work.</span></p>

                                              As was argued by the 
                                              Attorney-General, some of the 
                                              provisions of article 13 (1) would 
                                              give rise to much difficulty if 
                                              article 13 (1) were held to be 
                                              justiciable. For example, how was 
                                              the provision that every citizen 
                                              be entitled to a fair share of the 
                                              national produce to be enforced? 
                                              It is submitted therefore that the 
                                              actual holding that article 13 (1) 
                                              did not give rise to legally 
                                              enforceable rights is defensible 
                                              though the reasoning of the court 
                                              did not sufficiently analyse the 
                                              constitutional issues raised.</span></p>

                                              Of course, the absence of any 
                                              guidelines in the constitutional 
                                              document as to how the rights 
                                              contained in article 13 (1) were 
                                              to be enforced is not conclusive 
                                              as to whether they could have been 
                                              enforced by a selective process. 
                                              Any one familiar with the work of 
                                              the U.S. Supreme Court 
                                              particularly, in the area of the 
                                              Bill of Rights in the U.S. 
                                              Constitution, would probably argue 
                                              that the absence of any guideline 
                                              from the constitutional document 
                                              did not per se preclude the court 
                                              from fashioning out its own 
                                              doctrinal basis for the 
                                              enforcement of any of the

                                              One observation worth commenting 
                                              on is the court's argument that 
                                              the word &quot;should&quot; was used in the 
                                              declaration where, if it were 
                                              intended to be legally 
                                              enforceable, one would have 
                                              expected the word &quot;shall.&quot; This 
                                              argument is surprising in view of 
                                              the provisions of sections 27 and 
                                              28 of the Interpretation Act, 1960 
                                              (C.A. 4), which was in force at

                                              the two sections seem to make the 
                                              distinction between the effect of 
                                              &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;should&quot; no longer 
                                              necessary in Ghana. This argument 
                                              was, of course, not put to the 
                                              court. Neither did the court 
                                              advert its attention to it. Given 
                                              the narrow scope which the court 
                                              was prepared to give judicial 
                                              review, it is not inconceivable 
                                              that such an argument, if it had 
                                              been made to the court, would have 
                                              been rejected.</span></p>

                                              One peculiarity about the language 
                                              in which the constitutional grant 
                                              of the power of judicial review in 
                                              the 1960 Constitution was couched 
                                              may be pointed out. Article 42 (2) 
                                              talks of &quot;whether an enactment was 
                                              made in excess of the powers 
                                              conferred on Parliament by or 
                                              under the Constitution . . .&quot; (The 
                                              writer's emphasis.) This would 
                                              appear to suggest that judicial 
                                              review under the 1960 Constitution 
                                              was limited to the application of 
                                              the ultra vires doctrine. Did the 
                                              Supreme Court have jurisdiction to 
                                              determine the issue of conflict 
                                              between a constitutional provision 
                                              and an Act of Parliament where 
                                              Parliament was acting within its 
                                              authority? Article 42 (2) may be 
                                              contrasted with article 31(5) of 
                                              the 1957 Constitution. Article 
                                              31(5) grants the power of judicial 
                                              review to the Supreme Court &quot;in 
                                              all proceedings in which the 
                                              validity of any law is called in 
                                              question. . .&quot; If one is to give 
                                              any significance to the difference 
                                              in the language employed in the 
                                              two provisions, it seems that the 
                                              conclusion is that the 1957 
                                              Constitution contained a broader 
                                              grant of review power than the 
                                              1960 Constitution. In terms of 
                                              judicial attitude to the power of 
                                              review, our discussion of the few 
                                              cases concerned so far shows 
                                              clearly that under the 1957 
                                              Constitution judicial review was 
                                              given a broad view though it was 
                                              short-lived.38 Under the 1960 
                                              Constitution the courts themselves 
                                              narrowed severely the scope of 
                                              their power of judicial review. 
                                              The decision in Re Akoto assigned 
                                              a kind of mechanistic role to the 
                                              courts in their exercise of power

                                              not be amended at all by

                                              are articles 169(3) (4), chapter 
                                              one which contained the supremacy

                                              enforcement and defence of the 
                                              Constitution; article 127

                                              than under the authority of an Act

                                              prohibiting the establishment of

                                              there was a second set of 
                                              provisions which could only be 
                                              amended by being enlarged. These 
                                              included chapter four which dealt 
                                              with the liberty of the individual 
                                              (the human rights provisions); 
                                              chapter five which dealt with 
                                              representation of the people, 
                                              notable provisions of which may be 
                                              mentioned article 29 establishing 
                                              the right of every citizen of 
                                              sound mind and 21 years of age to 
                                              be registered as a voter, article 
                                              33 prohibiting the formation of 
                                              political parties on sectional 
                                              basis. Finally came the provisions 
                                              which could be amended but by a 
                                              procedure so tortuous as to ensure 
                                              that only amendments which were 
                                              absolutely necessary would be 
                                              embarked upon. Significant in this 
                                              procedure, apart from the 
                                              requirement of Gazette publication 
                                              for the proposal and the bill for 
                                              the amendment, was the requirement 
                                              that the amendment be passed by 
                                              two Parliaments. That is to say 
                                              the Constitution envisaged a 
                                              mandatory dissolution of the first 
                                              Parliament to pass the amendment 
                                              and then the amendment had to be 
                                              approved by the succeeding 
                                              National Assembly for it to become 
                                              effective.</span></p>

                                              entrusted in the hands of the High 
                                              Court with a right of appeal to 
                                              the Court of Appeal and then to

                                              rights provisions was concerned 
                                              the High Court had power to

                                              of the Constitution, as the 
                                              wording of article 106 suggests, 
                                              can only be embarked upon in a 
                                              concrete case. This means, of 
                                              course, that the Supreme Court 
                                              could not, suo motu exercise this 
                                              function. The wording of article 2 
                                              also leaves one in no doubt that 
                                              the declaratory relief could only 
                                              be sought in a concrete case. The 
                                              Constitutional Commission had 
                                              recommended that the Supreme Court 
                                              be given authority to render 
                                              advisory opinions on the 
                                              constitutionality of statutes 
                                              prior to final enactment. But this 
                                              was rejected by the Constituent 
                                              Assembly which promulgated the

                                              The impact of these provisions was 
                                              too plain to be lost on any one. 
                                              The power of the judiciary to

                                              constitutionality was left in no 
                                              doubt. Parties involved in 
                                              lawsuits were offered the 
                                              opportunity to raise 
                                              constitutional issues and the 
                                              remedies were made clear. With

                                              constitutional provisions, 
                                              problems were bound to arise. In 
                                              the face of such clear referral 
                                              procedure, the Supreme Court could 
                                              hardly avoid confronting questions 
                                              of constitutionality. It was thus 
                                              forced to grapple with such 
                                              problems long before it had 
                                              developed any avoidance techniques 
                                              along the lines of the U.S., West

                                              provision. It was to refer the 
                                              matter to the Supreme Court only 
                                              if it felt that there was some 
                                              ambiguity. This construction flies 
                                              in the face of the wording of 
                                              articles 2 and 106. The Supreme 
                                              Court's suggestion that a party 
                                              aggrieved by a holding of a lower 
                                              court could, if he chose, appeal 
                                              hardly solves the issue. In the 
                                              first case, it is trite law that 
                                              appeal does not lie as of right in 
                                              any matter. Secondly, if a party 
                                              which disagrees with the lower 
                                              court's ruling on the matter can 
                                              appeal on that issue, the aim of 
                                              the guidelines would be defeated. 
                                              For all that he had to do would be 
                                              to appeal against the decision of 
                                              the lower court.44</span></p>

                                              Admittedly, the Supreme Court was 
                                              trying to grapple with difficult 
                                              and unavoidable situation in view 
                                              of the wording of article 106(2). 
                                              The Constitution had by its 
                                              detailed and explicit provisions 
                                              regarding judicial review appeared 
                                              to have declared a free for all on 
                                              the raising of questions of 
                                              constitutionality.&nbsp; As already 
                                              pointed out, this situation gave 
                                              our Supreme Court obviously very 
                                              little room to manoeuvre to avoid 
                                              confronting constitutional issues 
                                              along the lines developed 
                                              elsewhere.&nbsp; Added to the wording 
                                              was also the fact that the makers 
                                              of the Constitution, as a perusal 
                                              of the Constitutional Commission's 
                                              proposals clearly shows, designed 
                                              the document to avoid situations 
                                              of the kind represented by the 
                                              Akoto opinion.&nbsp; It appeared that 
                                              the intention was to give the 
                                              courts no room to repeat that 
                                              opinion.&nbsp; In spite of this 
                                              apparent declared policy of the 
                                              framers of the 1969 Constitution, 
                                              it has to be admitted that for 
                                              practical purposes some rules of 
                                              avoidance had to be developed by 
                                              the courts.&nbsp; What is regretted 
                                              here is that the Supreme Court's 
                                              prescribed panacea offered no real 
                                              solution to the rather complex 
                                              problems.45</span></p>

                                              proceedings. After declaring that

                                              court ordered the Attorney-General

                                              possible violation of the 
                                              Constitution. In other words, the 
                                              court was satisfied that there was 
                                              an issue of constitutional 
                                              enforcement in the petition of the 
                                              plaintiff. The court however, 
                                              could not reach a unanimous 
                                              decision on the issue of 
                                              interpretation. The constitutional 
                                              provision which had appeared prima 
                                              facie plain and unambiguous to the 
                                              court earlier now became the

                                              It was the case of the plaintiff 
                                              that a commission of inquiry had 
                                              found that Mr. Gbedemah, who had 
                                              been elected member of parliament

                                              Mr. Gbedemah did not deny that he 
                                              had been so found by a commission 
                                              of inquiry. But he argued that the

                                              declared &quot; were used in the 
                                              Constitution in a legal sense. The 
                                              commission's findings could not 
                                              therefore be brought under their 
                                              ambit. Since the adjudication or 
                                              declaration was not that of a 
                                              court of competent jurisdiction he 
                                              could not be disqualified. In 
                                              particular he relied on article 
                                              102 which vested judicial power in 
                                              the judiciary and contended that 
                                              the acceptance of the arguments of

                                              interpretation (which the court 
                                              had in an earlier unanimous

                                              these sources but also showed an 
                                              awareness and deep appreciation of

                                              plaintiff's claim was only for a

                                              dismissal. The court therefore 
                                              held that it had no jurisdiction 
                                              to entertain the action at first 
                                              instance. This had also been the

                                              review. It had been argued by the 
                                              plaintiff that article 24(1) of 
                                              the Constitution which dealt with 
                                              freedom of movement gave him, an 
                                              alien, the right of immunity from 
                                              expulsion from Ghana. It was 
                                              further contended that the 
                                              minister's revocation of his 
                                              residence permit was 
                                              unconstitutional because the 
                                              minister had given no reasons. The 
                                              failure to give reasons, according 
                                              to the plaintiff violated article 
                                              173 which had laid down guidelines 
                                              for the exercise of discretionary 
                                              power.</span></p>

                                              The court rejected the argument 
                                              that article 24 inured to the 
                                              benefit of the plaintiff, a 
                                              non-citizen. The court reasoned 
                                              that by virtue of the Aliens Act, 
                                              1963 (Act 160), the minister was 
                                              entitled to revoke an alien's 
                                              residence permit any time and this 
                                              power had not, in the opinion of 
                                              the court, been disturbed by the 
                                              Constitution. Turning to the 
                                              contention that the revocation 
                                              violated article 173 because the 
                                              minister gave no reasons, the 
                                              court held that the minister in 
                                              exercising his power under the 
                                              Aliens Act was not exercising the 
                                              sort of discretion contemplated by 
                                              article 173. The court then made 
                                              the following pronouncement which 
                                              was largely gratuitous52: </span>

                                              &quot;There is a very loose sense in 
                                              which it can be said that most 
                                              decisions taken by ministers in 
                                              the day-to-day performance of 
                                              their ministerial duties involve 
                                              the exercise of some discretion . 
                                              . . But can it be seriously argued 
                                              that the exercise of discretion in 
                                              this sense by ministers must 
                                              comply with the requirements of 
                                              article 173 . . . ? The government 
                                              could hardly govern if this were 
                                              so. In so far as the Memorandum 
                                              contained in the Proposals for a 
                                              Constitution for Ghana is any 
                                              guide at all, the three 
                                              paragraphs, namely, 731, 732 and 
                                              733 . . . and 515 . . . show 
                                              clearly that the sort of 
                                              discretionary powers contemplated 
                                              by article 173 are those that 
                                              arise when the legislature or the

                                              scope of article 173 can hardly 
                                              stand analysis. The paragraphs of

                                              State's argument was based 
                                              entirely on Kelsen's Pure Theory 
                                              of Law. It was argued that the 
                                              coup d'etat of 24 February 1966 
                                              had destroyed the legal order in 
                                              existence before then and with it 
                                              the existing law. A new legal 
                                              order was established from which 
                                              all law derive their validity. 
                                              Consequently, the plaintiff was 
                                              caught squarely by section 9 (1) 
                                              of the transitional provisions.</span></p>

                                              The court rejected the Kelsenite 
                                              argument. As far as it was 
                                              concerned the question was the 
                                              meaning to be given to the word 
                                              &quot;established.&quot; Did it mean create 
                                              or continue in existence? The 
                                              court was satisfied that the word 
                                              had been used in the Constitution 
                                              to mean create, in the sense of 
                                              bringing into being. It found that 
                                              the office held by Mr. Sallah had 
                                              been in existence before the coup 
                                              d'etat of 1966. The majority 
                                              therefore held that Mr. Sallah was 
                                              not holding such an office as was 
                                              contemplated by section 9(1).56

                                              constitutional litigation. The 
                                              plaintiff-appellant in this case 
                                              was found to have acquired assets

                                              by a commission of inquiry. In 
                                              September 1969, the National

                                              against the plaintiff. The 
                                              Plaintiff brought an action in the 
                                              High Court to stop the State from 
                                              proceeding against him. He 
                                              complained that no judgment had

                                              the plaintiff, contended that its 
                                              action was based on N.L.C.D. 400 
                                              and therefore lawful. The 
                                              plaintiff countered by saying that 
                                              N.L.C.D. 400 violated articles 12 
                                              and 18 of the Constitution which 
                                              debarred the State from depriving 
                                              him of his property without 
                                              compensation. He therefore invited 
                                              the High Court to strike down 
                                              N.L.C.D. 400 as unconstitutional.</span></p>

                                              declined the invitation. His view 
                                              was that the action could only be 
                                              properly entertained by the 
                                              Supreme Court. The plaintiff 
                                              appealed to the Court of Appeal. 
                                              The ordinary bench of that court 
                                              heard the appeal. It concluded 
                                              that the High Court had 
                                              jurisdiction to entertain the suit 
                                              but it declined to remit the suit 
                                              to the High Court. It based itself 
                                              on section 13 of the State 
                                              Proceedings Act, 1961 (Act 51), 
                                              and argued that the injunctive 
                                              relief which the 
                                              plaintiff-appellant sought could

                                              State. The ordinary bench thought 
                                              it would stultify itself if it 
                                              remitted the case to the High 
                                              Court to determine a relief which 
                                              Act 51 peremptorily debarred it

                                              heard by the full bench of the

                                              had been abolished. The question

                                              N.L.C.D. 400. The majority of the

                                              N.L.C.D. 400 did not offend 
                                              against articles 12 and 18 of the 
                                              Constitution. In the opinion of 
                                              the majority, N.L.C.D. 400 was 
                                              promulgated to implement the 
                                              findings of commissions and to 
                                              provide a convenient machinery for 
                                              getting in assets and money found 
                                              to have been unlawfully acquired. 
                                              It was not the enactment that 
                                              divested plaintiff-appellant of 
                                              his property. Our immediate 
                                              concern, however, is not with the 
                                              actual decision but with the 
                                              reasoning by which it was arrived 
                                              at. </span></p>

                                              Significantly and in line with the 
                                              approach to constitutional 
                                              litigation which we have noticed 
                                              in the earlier cases, the full 
                                              bench in this case considered the 
                                              litigation as raising purely a 
                                              problem of statutory 
                                              interpretation. The majority 
                                              opinion described the court's 
                                              constitutional role as being &quot;interpretory. 
                                              &quot; But it is at least heartening to 
                                              notice that the court, in this 
                                              case, in spite of the limited view 
                                              it took of its role, showed some 
                                              awareness of other competing 
                                              constitutional and social policy 
                                              interests involved and the role of 
                                              these interests in constitutional 
                                              litigation. The majority opinion 
                                              made it unmistakably clear that 
                                              where the legislature takes steps 
                                              to establish probity in public 
                                              life, and the Constitution also 
                                              contains provisions designed to 
                                              achieve the same end, the function 
                                              of the judiciary must be to lend a 
                                              helping hand by putting liberal 
                                              construction on the enactment to 
                                              achieve this end.59</span></p>

                                              The plaintiff-appellant had also 
                                              argued that the main features of 
                                              N.L.C.D. 400 usurped &quot;judicial 
                                              power&quot; vested by the Constitution 
                                              in the judiciary, and therefore 
                                              the Decree should be nullified. 
                                              That argument did not impress the 
                                              majority. They found nothing 
                                              &quot;judicial&quot; in the declared aim and 
                                              effect of the legislation. As far 
                                              as the majority of the court were 
                                              concerned, the unlawfully acquired 
                                              assets had become vested in the 
                                              State before the promulgation of 
                                              N.L.C.D. 400. N.L.C.D. 400 was 
                                              merely designed to bring in what 
                                              had already been effectively 
                                              vested in the State.</span></p>

                                              It would be recalled that in the 
                                              discussion at the earlier part of 
                                              this section, it was suggested 
                                              that the High Court had power of a 
                                              limited nature under article 28 of 
                                              the Constitution to review 
                                              enactments found to be 
                                              inconsistent with articles 12-27 
                                              inclusive. The opinion of the 
                                              majority lends some support for 
                                              this view-point. The majority, 
                                              however, seemed to have been of 
                                              the view that questions of 
                                              interpretation would have had to 
                                              be referred to the Supreme Court 
                                              even where the High Court was 
                                              acting under article 28. With 
                                              respect, it is difficult to see 
                                              why this should be so. Article 28 
                                              is, in the opinion of the writer, 
                                              in terms wide enough to clothe the 
                                              High Court with jurisdiction to 
                                              interpret the Constitution. It is 
                                              therefore submitted that where the 
                                              High Court was adjudicating in a 
                                              case in which a party claimed that 
                                              articles 12-27 were being violated 
                                              in relation to him, the High Court 
                                              had power under article 28 to 
                                              interpret and nullify legislation 
                                              if that was necessary for the 
                                              resolution of the litigation.</span></p>

                                              The Benneh case, however, further 
                                              confirms the impression gathered 
                                              from the writer's reading of the 
                                              earlier cases decided under the 
                                              1969 Constitution, namely, that 
                                              our judges considered their role, 
                                              when called upon to exercise their 
                                              power of judicial review, as 
                                              merely involving delving into the 
                                              intricacies of statutory 
                                              interpretation. In the Benneh 
                                              case, however, there was a welcome 
                                              change in the beat of the song. 
                                              The court appeared prepared to 
                                              give some role to other broad 
                                              policy considerations.</span></p>

                                              We may now consider what may be 
                                              characterised as a peculiar 
                                              practice of some of the High Court 
                                              judges under the 1969 
                                              Constitution. It would be recalled 
                                              that the constitutional provisions 
                                              on judicial review, in particular, 
                                              article 106(2) required lower 
                                              courts to &quot;stay the proceedings 
                                              and refer the question of law 
                                              involved to the Supreme Court for 
                                              determination&quot; where a question of 
                                              constitutionality arose before the 
                                              lower court. In a number of cases, 
                                              however, in the face of the clear 
                                              and mandatory provisions, the High 
                                              Court refused to refer the issues 
                                              to the Supreme Court and proceeded 
                                              to nullify provisions in certain 
                                              enactments on the grounds that 
                                              such provisions violated the

                                              The first of such cases was the 
                                              Republic v. Boateng; Ex parte 
                                              Adu-Gyamfi II.60 In that case 
                                              preliminary objection was taken to 
                                              the jurisdiction of the High 
                                              Court. The argument was that 
                                              section 52 of the Courts Act, 1971 
                                              (Act 372),61 had ousted the 
                                              jurisdiction of the High Court in 
                                              chieftaincy matters. It was 
                                              further argued that this view was 
                                              fortified by articles 154 and 155 
                                              of the Constitution. The 
                                              cumulative effect of these 
                                              provisions, so it was contended, 
                                              was to divest the High Court of 
                                              jurisdiction in chieftaincy 
                                              matters. After due consideration 
                                              of articles 102, 113 and 114 of 
                                              the Constitution, the learned 
                                              judge held that section 52 of Act 
                                              372 could not oust the 
                                              jurisdiction of the High Court or 
                                              the Court of Appeal. The learned 
                                              judge therefore held the purported 
                                              ouster inoperative.</span></p>

                                              It was also argued that as a 
                                              question of interpretation or 
                                              enforcement of the Constitution 
                                              had been raised in the 
                                              proceedings, the High Court must 
                                              refer the issue to the Supreme 
                                              Court in accordance with article 
                                              106(2). The learned judge drew a 
                                              distinction between &quot;enforcing&quot; 
                                              and &quot;applying&quot; the Constitution. 
                                              In the former case, the learned 
                                              judge agreed that the proper forum 
                                              was the Supreme Court but not in 
                                              the latter case. The learned judge 
                                              found support for his refusal to 
                                              refer the issue to the Supreme 
                                              Court in the dicta in the 
                                              Maikankan case to which we have 
                                              already alluded. What was clear 
                                              here, however, was that the 
                                              learned judge expressly nullified 
                                              a provision in an enactment as 
                                              being inconsistent with a 
                                              constitutional provision. This was 
                                              an exercise of a power which the 
                                              Constitution declared was the 
                                              exclusive preserve of the Supreme 
                                              Court.62</span></p>

                                              Ghanaian citizens and therefore

                                              which the courts considered as

                                              It was contended on behalf of 
                                              Salifa, who had brought an 
                                              application for habeas corpus, 
                                              that the document produced before 
                                              the court could not be a valid 
                                              Decree because it bore no number 
                                              and had not been published in the 
                                              gazette.&nbsp; The court was therefore 
                                              invited to declare his detention 
                                              unlawful, as not having been 
                                              authorised by any valid enactment.</span></p>

                                              habeas corpus the learned judge 
                                              made a number of observations 
                                              which must be of considerable 
                                              interest to the constitutional 
                                              lawyer.&nbsp; He ruled that a document 
                                              in violation of the provisions of 
                                              the Proclamation could not be a 
                                              valid Decree.&nbsp; A document that was 
                                              not promulgated or published (in

                                              3(5) of the Proclamation, 1966, 
                                              gave the National Liberation

                                              Proclamation, however, the learned 
                                              judge concluded that the National 
                                              Liberation Council had come into 
                                              power to eradicate &quot;illimitability

                                              a Decree. He concluded from his

                                              that a Decree could become

                                              To bring down the curtain on our 
                                              discussion, we may now look at 
                                              Republic v. Military Tribunal; Ex

                                              National Redemption Council came 
                                              into power in January 1972. The 
                                              applicants, together with others, 
                                              had been convicted by a military 
                                              tribunal of the offences of 
                                              subversion under the Subversion 
                                              Decree, 1972 (N.R.C.D. 90). They 
                                              had also been convicted of 
                                              conspiracy to commit subversion. 
                                              They sought an order of certiorari 
                                              to quash the conviction on the 
                                              conspiracy charge on the grounds 
                                              that the military tribunal which 
                                              tried them did not have 
                                              jurisdiction to try them on the 
                                              conspiracy charge. The respondents 
                                              raised a preliminary objection to 
                                              the jurisdiction of the High Court 
                                              to entertain the action. The 
                                              respondents contended, inter alia, 
                                              that the High Court was precluded 
                                              by the provisions of section 20 of 
                                              the Courts Act, 1971 (Act 372), 
                                              from exercising its supervisory 
                                              powers over military tribunals. To

                                              section 20 of the Courts Act, 
                                              1971, was invalid because it was 
                                              inconsistent with article 114 of 
                                              the 1969 Constitution, the 
                                              respondents replied that the High 
                                              Court did not have the power to 
                                              declare an enactment a nullity and 
                                              must therefore refer that issue to 
                                              the full bench of the Court of

                                              Abban J. overruled the 
                                              jurisdictional objection based on 
                                              section 20 of Act 372. He came to 
                                              the conclusion that that section 
                                              was inconsistent with article 114 
                                              of the Constitution, 1969, in as 
                                              much as it sought to limit the 
                                              wide supervisory jurisdiction 
                                              conferred on the High Court by the 
                                              Constitution. In his opinion, Act 
                                              372 was enacted under the 
                                              authority of the suspended 
                                              Constitution and its provisions 
                                              could not therefore amend, limit 
                                              or take away any jurisdiction 
                                              conferred by the said Constitution 
                                              on the High Court. The words 
                                              &quot;other than a military Court or 
                                              tribunal&quot; were clearly 
                                              inconsistent with the provisions 
                                              of article 114. Therefore in his 
                                              opinion, they were to be 
                                              considered inoperative from the 
                                              date Act 372 came into effect.

                                              Court had no jurisdiction to 
                                              nullify it and that the issue 
                                              should be referred to the Court of 
                                              Appeal which alone had the power 
                                              to declare an enactment a nullity.

                                              In reaching this conclusion, the

                                              National Liberation Council were 
                                              unreviewable. For a closer reading

                                              meant in those cases. The Benneh 
                                              opinion makes the point clearer. 
                                              The full bench here was 
                                              unmistakably referring to 
                                              substantive constitutionality. 
                                              There being no constitution, the 
                                              full bench, it is submitted, was 
                                              right in saying that no enactment 
                                              could have been struck down,

                                              substance was concerned. Neither

                                              Furthermore, there was nothing 
                                              like section 29 (1) of the

                                              In this article, we have 
                                              considered judicial review of 
                                              legislation in Ghana since 
                                              independence. The picture that 
                                              unfolded itself was not altogether 
                                              one to make it possible for a 
                                              confident forecast of the future 
                                              of review in the constitutional 
                                              law of Ghana. A number of reasons 
                                              have been advanced for the present 
                                              attitude of the courts in Ghana to 
                                              review of legislation. These have 
                                              to a large extent been attributed 
                                              to the myopic view of and a 
                                              possible under-estimation of the 
                                              potential of the power of review 
                                              demonstrated by our courts. It has 
                                              been suggested that part of the 
                                              problem stems from the legal 
                                              training received by most of the 
                                              judges who occupy the superior 
                                              bench in Ghana. We have also noted 
                                              the rather disturbing practice by 
                                              some judges of declaring 
                                              enactments null and void in the 
                                              face of clear constitutional 
                                              provisions denying them such 
                                              power. It has been urged on the 
                                              courts that the discordant notes 
                                              must be harmonised.</span></p>

                                              The preceding discussion has all 
                                              been done within the context of 
                                              the type of judicial review we 
                                              have adopted since independence. 
                                              To what extent has our choice been 
                                              efficacious in promoting review? 
                                              How much of the failure of the 
                                              judges can we attribute to the 
                                              system employed by our past 
                                              independence Constitutions? These 
                                              are questions which need serious 
                                              attention and to which one may 
                                              attempt some brief replies. Our 
                                              discussion has clearly shown that 
                                              the principle of the supremacy of 
                                              the Constitution and its 
                                              consequences do not give rise to 
                                              much dispute. A fundamental 
                                              problem however, is that of the 
                                              proper means for ensuring this 
                                              supremacy. Hitherto the task of 
                                              determining the constitutionality 
                                              of enactments has been entrusted 
                                              to the highest court of the land 
                                              at any given time, without a 
                                              clear-cut guideline as to the role 
                                              to be played by the lower courts. 
                                              This has given rise to the 
                                              unsatisfactory practice, we noted 
                                              under the 1969 Constitution, of 
                                              some High Court judges declaring 
                                              acts a nullity where it seemed 
                                              very clear that they did not 
                                              possess the power so to do. The 
                                              question therefore remains: how do 
                                              we enforce the supremacy of the 
                                              Constitution in the future? </span>

                                              The teachings of comparative law 
                                              show us that there are many 
                                              systems of judicial review of 
                                              legislation in force in various 
                                              countries. Basically there are 
                                              three classes, namely, review by 
                                              the ordinary courts of the land as 
                                              for example, in the United States; 
                                              review by the highest court of the 
                                              land which is in fact a variant of 
                                              the first class, of which Ghana is 
                                              a good example; and thirdly, 
                                              review by a special constitutional 
                                              court. Those countries which adopt 
                                              the third solution also show 
                                              certain fundamental differences in 
                                              their special courts. The 
                                              composition of the special court 
                                              shows whether it is a political 
                                              court or a judicial court. Thus 
                                              the West German Constitutional 
                                              Court is undoubtedly a judicial 
                                              body whilst all constitutional law 
                                              experts agree that the French 
                                              Constitutional Council is a 
                                              political body. The Francophone 
                                              African States also show some 
                                              interesting models.80 Control of

                                              Brazzaville under the 1967 
                                              Constitution, is entrusted to the 
                                              Supreme Court, the highest court 
                                              of the land. Their Supreme Courts 
                                              in general comprise several units. 
                                              Control of constitutionality is 
                                              exercised by the constitutional 
                                              chamber. The composition of the 
                                              constitutional chambers differs 
                                              from country to country. The 
                                              composition of the constitutional 
                                              chamber in Ivory Coast for 
                                              example, is political and that of 
                                              Senegal is judicial in character.</span></p>

                                              necessary that the system be 
                                              modified. Given our experiences, 
                                              it is submitted that the best 
                                              solution is probably one that 
                                              enables all courts in our judicial 
                                              system to resolve questions of 
                                              constitutionality when raised 
                                              before them by parties in 
                                              litigation. The other alternative 
                                              is the creation of a special court 
                                              outside the regular system as 
                                              obtains in West Germany. But the 
                                              drawback on this approach is that 
                                              after the special court has 
                                              determined the constitutional 
                                              issue, the court before whom the 
                                              point was raised has to act in 
                                              accordance with that ruling. The 
                                              time spent in the process does not 
                                              appear justified. In the 
                                              considered view of the writer, it 
                                              should be possible for all courts 
                                              in the judicial system to 
                                              entertain and dispose of 
                                              constitutional issues. There would 
                                              be some saving in the cost of 
                                              litigation if this suggestion is 
                                              adopted.</span></p>

                                              One other drawback to be guarded 
                                              against is the kind of detailed 
                                              provisions that the 1969 
                                              Constitution contained on judicial 
                                              review. The opportunities for 
                                              raising questions of 
                                              constitutionality were far too 
                                              many and account for part of the 
                                              unenlightening performance of our 
                                              judges as they tried to get 
                                              themselves out of the complex 
                                              situation in which the 
                                              Constitution had placed them. It 
                                              is understandable that framers of 
                                              Constitutions in Ghana would for a 
                                              long time be haunted by the Akoto 
                                              opinion and would strive to avoid 
                                              such a situation recurring. Care, 
                                              however, must be taken to ensure 
                                              that we do not overshoot our mark 
                                              as we appeared to have done with 
                                              the 1969 Constitution.</span></p>

                                              In the long-run view, whether or 
                                              not judicial review takes root 
                                              effectively in Ghana would depend 
                                              also to a large extent, on the 
                                              willingness of the people of Ghana 
                                              to allow constitutionalism to 
                                              flourish. As Gunther rightly 
                                              pointed out &quot;making a constitution 
                                              work is a difficult, subtle, 
                                              complex process&quot;81 which cannot be 
                                              achieved by courts alone; nor can 
                                              the mere existence of a written 
                                              constitution make it succeed. The 
                                              constitutional language and 
                                              judicial actions, and perhaps most 
                                              importantly the behaviour of 
                                              political leaders and of all 
                                              participants in the political 
                                              process are all necessary.82&nbsp; It 
                                              implies an implicit faith in the 
                                              constitutional ideal. Without 
                                              this, neither the best disposition
