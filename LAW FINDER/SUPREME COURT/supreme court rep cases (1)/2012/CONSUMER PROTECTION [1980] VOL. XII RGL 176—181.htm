                                              consumer as well as the usage of

                                              Consumer protection is one problem 
                                              area that has been identified as 
                                              critical and echoed in virtually 
                                              every government policy since the 
                                              1960s. It has acquired some 
                                              prominence for various reasons: 
                                              First the country does not have 
                                              enough foreign exchange to import 
                                              all of the goods to go round the 
                                              consuming and buying public. 
                                              Secondly, our factories do not 
                                              produce at full capacities. Thus, 
                                              goods are in short supply. 
                                              Thirdly, certain activities of 
                                              traders such as hoarding and 
                                              smuggling have worsened the 
                                              consumer’s plight. Fourthly, the 
                                              business sector is dominated by 
                                              traders who have not only 
                                              monopolised the distributive 
                                              outlets, but also, sell at high 
                                              prices largely with impunity. 
                                              There is, therefore, the need for 
                                              State intervention. This is 
                                              especially so when prices of 
                                              consumer goods change almost every 
                                              week in the wake of acute shortage 
                                              of consumer goods with its

                                              the manipulations of commercial 
                                              firms’ managers and retailers has 
                                              become important. Successive 
                                              governments have recognised that 
                                              unfair practices are widespread in 
                                              consumer transactions. The 
                                              consumer may either be too 
                                              ignorant or under too many 
                                              pressures to resist concluding 
                                              imprudent and harsh bargains. The 
                                              ordinary worker’s minimum daily 
                                              wage is ¢12. He buys a loaf of 
                                              bread at between ¢12 and ¢30. A

                                              needs to prepare her stew costs 
                                              ¢10. A box of matches is ¢1. The 
                                              control price of a bag of rice is 
                                              ¢200. When it can be found at all, 
                                              it is offered for anything up to 
                                              ¢1,000. Because of the acute 
                                              shortages, there is always a 
                                              milling crowd of consumers who 
                                              queue in the scorching sun to 
                                              obtain their needs. A greater 
                                              number of consumers do not have 
                                              access to the goods, When they 
                                              have access at all, the prices are 
                                              so high that the consumer is 
                                              unable to satisfy his needs. Thus 
                                              “it is understandable and proper 
                                              for the State to be concerned 
                                              about the things on which people 
                                              spend their money and even to use 
                                              persuasion to influence the scale

                                              expenditure patterns.7” It is in

                                              institutions exist to afford

                                              discussion to test a hypothesis 
                                              that there is a divergence between

                                              attitude. In Acquah v. The 
                                              Republic9, the appellant was 
                                              charged with keeping eleven bags 
                                              of rice in a manner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; likely to

                                              commodity to the public. She was 
                                              found guilty by the trial circuit 
                                              judge. A fine of ¢50 was imposed 
                                              in default of which she was to go

                                              At the hearing of the appeal 
                                              counsel for the appellant 
                                              challenged the interpretation of 
                                              the learned trial circuit judge of 
                                              paragraph (b) of section 6 (1) of 
                                              the Price Control Decree, 1972 (N.R.C.D. 
                                              17). The appellant's counsel 
                                              argued that failure to display the 
                                              goods did not constitute keeping 
                                              goods in a manner likely to create 
                                              shortages. He contended that there 
                                              ought to have been some evidence 
                                              that the appellant refused to 
                                              sell. In dismissing the appeal, 
                                              Charles Crabbe J. (as he then was) 
                                              held that lack of display of goods 
                                              constituted “keeping goods in a 
                                              manner likely to create or 
                                              contribute to a shortage of those 
                                              goods available to the public” and 
                                              constituted hoarding under section 
                                              5 of N.R.C.D. 17. His reason was 
                                              that the display of goods by a 
                                              trader at his place of business 
                                              was the only way by which the 
                                              public could know that a trader

                                              It was again stressed that the 
                                              Decree must be enforced vigorously 
                                              “taking into consideration the 
                                              cause and necessity for the issue 
                                              of the Decree.”12 The writer is of 
                                              the view that this would seem to 
                                              be the proper approach to the 
                                              construction of any Price Control 
                                              Decree. It is vigorous enough and 
                                              thus preferable. It seeks to 
                                              remove any doubts about the 
                                              divergence between popular 
                                              expectation and the law’s 
                                              attitude. It is suggested that 
                                              other judges should follow Charles 
                                              Crabbe J.’s example. This is 
                                              because it accords more with the 
                                              intention of legislature which is 
                                              the eradication of trade 
                                              malpractices or kalabule. It is 
                                              difficult to escape this 
                                              conclusion.</span></p>

                                              Republic13. In that case, the

                                              sections 2 and 3 (1) (b) of the 
                                              Price Control Decree, 1972 (N.R.C.D. 
                                              17). He pleaded not guilty and 
                                              after his trial he was found 
                                              guilty, convicted and sentenced to 
                                              three months’ imprisonment with 
                                              hard labour. His appeal against

                                              appellate High Court. It is 
                                              interesting to contrast the manner 
                                              in which the problem of consumer 
                                              protection was dealt with in this 
                                              case at the magistrate court and 
                                              High Court respectively. The trial 
                                              magistrate held that the words “at

                                              It is possible to interprete the 
                                              High Court’s decision as holding 
                                              that exposing consumer goods to 
                                              the public view and not selling it 
                                              is not a crime. It has to be 
                                              proved that the seller has sold 
                                              above the controlled price. The 
                                              writer believes that one of the 
                                              purposes of the Decree would be 
                                              defeated if it was open to a 
                                              seller to refuse to sell. Refusing 
                                              to sell is one of the very evils 
                                              against which the section was 
                                              directed. In so far as Osei-Hwere 
                                              J., held that it is only when the 
                                              seller refuses to sell that he 
                                              violates section 3 (1) (b) of the 
                                              Decree, his decision is socially 
                                              and economically undesirable. His 
                                              conclusion (with the greatest 
                                              respect) misses the mark because 
                                              he was not concerned with selling 
                                              above the controlled price. Thus, 
                                              on this ground, the judge’s 
                                              reasons appear unpersuasive. 
                                              Ghanaian consumers have been 
                                              urging government to eliminate 
                                              kalabule. To succeed, the courts 
                                              must break this social evil by 
                                              dealing ruthlessly with dishonest 
                                              trades. It would appear that 
                                              Osei-Hwere J. arrived at his 
                                              decision in the Adom case under a 
                                              mistaken view of section 3 (1) (b) 
                                              of N.R.C.D. 17. He failed, with 
                                              the greatest respect, to 
                                              appreciate the cause and necessity 
                                              for the issuing of the Decree, 
                                              which is that the country faces a 
                                              shortage of the basic goods. The 
                                              Decree is intended to remedy the 
                                              defect in our economic system 
                                              which allows some people to obtain 
                                              goods at reasonable prices and 
                                              hoard them, thereby selling them 
                                              at unreasonably high prices, and

                                              High Court would appear to suggest 
                                              a conflict of judicial opinion 
                                              which has arisen and awaits 
                                              resolution by the higher courts. 
                                              In the meantime, it seems to the 
                                              present writer that the approach, 
                                              interpretation and conclusion of 
                                              Charles Crabbe J. (as he then was) 
                                              is more preferable. The 
                                              alternative view put forward by 
                                              Osei-Hwere J., will not protect 
                                              the interests of the consumer, and 
                                              deal with the mischief sought to 
                                              be remedied by the legislature. 
                                              The better approach, like that of 
                                              Charles Crabbe J., is to construe 
                                              the sections contra proferentem, 
                                              that is, in favour of the 
                                              consumer. Such an approach would 
                                              enhance consumer protection in 
                                              Ghana, which would appear to be 
                                              the desired hope of the consumer.</span></p>

                                              However, it may be re-assuring to 
                                              the consumer that his protection 
                                              appears to have been considered by 
                                              our legislators with the 
                                              promulgation of the Imports and 
                                              Exports (Special Licence) 
                                              Regulations, 1980. The passage of 
                                              these regulations is to enable 
                                              Ghanaians who have money abroad to 
                                              bring in consumer goods. Section 1 
                                              (1) of the regulations provides 
                                              that any person may import maize, 
                                              edible oil, sugar cube, granulated 
                                              sugar, milk, fish frozen, soap, 
                                              detergents and toilet rolls.16</span></p>

                                              Since the announcement of the 
                                              government’s trade liberalisation 
                                              policy following upon the 
                                              enactment of L.I. 1248, some of 
                                              the consumer goods which were in 
                                              short supply are on sale at the 
                                              markets, although at exorbitant 
                                              prices. This has given the 
                                              unmistakable impression that 
                                              consumer goods are in adequate 
                                              supply. However, the fact that the 
                                              shelves of our shops continue to 
                                              be empty illustrate the stark 
                                              truth that there is scarcity of 
                                              consumer goods. One would have 
                                              thought that in the light of 
                                              chronic shortages and high prices, 
                                              any legislation passed purporting 
                                              to remedy the situation would take 
                                              account of present realities. 
                                              However, it would appear that L.I. 
                                              1248 is of limited scope at the 
                                              moment. This is because basic 
                                              goods such as rice, baby foods, 
                                              sardine and mackerel are excluded 
                                              from the list of goods specified 
                                              in the schedule. The better policy 
                                              will be to widen the scope of 
                                              goods which can be imported to 
                                              reflect the reality of the 
                                              situation. There are no local 
                                              substitutes at the moment and if 
                                              the trade liberalisation policy is 
                                              to succeed no restrictions should 
                                              be placed on Ghanaians who have 
                                              money abroad and who may wish to 
                                              take advantage of the trade 
                                              liberalisation.</span></p>

                                              L.I. 1248 may also be said to be 
                                              yet another piece of legislation 
                                              which controls prices of consumer 
                                              goods. By its section 4 (1), no 
                                              goods imported under a special 
                                              licence for commercial purposes 
                                              shall be sold in the country 
                                              except in accordance with the 
                                              price specified for such goods 
                                              under the Price Control Decree, 
                                              1974 (N.R.C.D. 305). In this 
                                              regard, section 4 (2) of L.I. 1248 
                                              seeks to authorise the Minister of 
                                              Trade to regulate the prices of 
                                              any imported goods specified in 
                                              the schedule under the Special 
                                              Licence. Plainly, this discretion 
                                              has not been exercised with the 
                                              result that such goods are sold at 
                                              unreasonably high prices. This 
                                              has, no doubt, caused severe 
                                              hardships to the consumer, the 
                                              mischief which the liberalisation 
                                              policy sought to cure.</span></p>

                                              The view of your commentator is 
                                              that in the light of present 
                                              woeful economic conditions, the 
                                              minister may not be able to 
                                              regulate the prices of any goods 
                                              brought into the country under L.I. 
                                              1248. The stark truth is that 
                                              small importers and retailers who 
                                              have taken advantage of this 
                                              legislation have had to indulge in 
                                              “black market” deals. Against the 
                                              background of ever-increasing 
                                              black market currency deals, the 
                                              Minister of Trade will find it 
                                              almost impossible to fix prices 
                                              for goods “imported” under L.I. 
                                              1248. Any prices fixed by him 
                                              would seem reasonable from the 
                                              point of view of government and 
                                              the consumer. However, it may be 
                                              unreasonable to the importer who 
                                              may decide not to bring in more 
                                              goods. To avoid such a situation, 
                                              the discretion under section 4 (2) 
                                              may take sometime to be exercised 
                                              by the Minister of Trade. 
                                              Meanwhile, the consumer has to 
                                              protect himself. This is by no 
                                              means an easy task. Wherein, 
                                              therefore, lies the protection 
                                              that section 4 (1) and (2) 
                                              purports to accord the consumer?</span></p>

                                              describe the fraudulent deals and 
                                              cheating which go on in the 
                                              process of buying and selling. It 
                                              is believed to have originated 
                                              somewhere in 1976 when Ghana faced 
                                              a real crisis with regard to 
                                              consumer goods. Some Ghanaians 
                                              began to engage in trade 
                                              malpractices, bribery and 
                                              corruption. In 1979 when these 
                                              activities became uncontrollable 
                                              the term was replaced by ginabu 
                                              which describes the art of buying 
                                              from trader A and re-selling the 
                                              same item to a consumer or buyer 
                                              at the same spot for five or six 
                                              times the original price. A critic 
                                              has suggested, however, that the 
                                              word probably sprang from the 
                                              Hausa expression “Kere kabure”—“Keep
