												According to the plaintiff, the 
												Defendant took delivery of the 3

												using, still unregistered. A 
												long time thereafter when he did 
												not hear from the Defendant he

												to pay for the balance of the

												- The Plaintiff, who claimed

												the family and the inaction of 
												the head of family despite 
												repeated calls on him to act 
												decisively in defence of the

												the disputed property was 
												originally acquired by his 
												ancestors, Nana Ama Serwaah and 
												Nana Kweku Bewuowu around 1906. 
												He further alleges that in 1926, 
												the Kumasi Public Health Board 
												acquired a site in the vicinity 
												of his ancestor&#8217;s property for 
												&#8220;sanitary purposes&#8221;. He further 
												alleged that in demolishing the 
												structures on the site the Board 
												had acquired for the project, 
												they inadvertently demolished 
												the two buildings which his 
												ancestors had erected on their 
												plot of land, some twenty years 
												earlier. after years of 
												agitation, the government of 
												Ghana in 1968 returned their 
												land to the family. This was 
												expected to be done through Mr. 
												Michael Reginald Asante, the 
												head of family at the time, 
												whom, understandably, by virtue 
												of his position as such family 
												head, and the equally important 
												fact that he was literate, was 
												authorised by the family, to 
												conduct all negotiations with 
												regard to the property for and 
												on behalf of the family as 
												family property, and clearly not 
												as his personal property.&nbsp; The 
												plaintiff claimed that since 
												then he had dealt with the 
												property as family property. The 
												further contention is that 
												however, in 1993, when they 
												discovered that Asante had on 
												occasions dealt with the 
												property without their consent 
												and concurrence in a manner 
												which was totally inconsistent 
												with their right and interest in 
												the property, they had 
												persistently warded off a number

												holding himself out as Omanhene 
												and President of the Wassa Fiase 
												Traditional Council were never 
												served on him.&nbsp; Nevertheless, in 
												May 1995, the applicant together 
												with his mother, the Queenmother, 
												and all his kingmakers were 
												convicted of contempt by the 
												High Court, Sekondi, for 
												infringing the said interim 
												injunction.&nbsp; This conviction was 
												subsequently quashed by the 
												Supreme Court in December 
												1995.&nbsp;&nbsp; In November 1998, the 
												applicant was again convicted of 
												contempt of the Regional House 
												of Chiefs by the High Court, 
												Sekondi, in respect of an 
												incident involving his receiving 
												an oath of allegiance from a 
												Divisional Chief.&nbsp; This 
												conviction was also set aside by 
												the Court of Appeal in April 
												1999.&nbsp; Finally, the applicant 
												was convicted by the High Court, 
												Sekondi, in April 2002 for 
												continuing to hold himself out 
												as Omanhene in spite of the 
												interim injunction of 1994.&nbsp; The 
												applicant was sentenced to 14 
												days imprisonment, without the 
												option of a fine, and he served 
												14 days in the Central Prison, 
												Sekondi.&nbsp; &nbsp;Whilst the applicant 
												was in prison, he was informed 
												that the Reverend William Chika 
												Morgan had been nominated, 
												elected and installed as the new 
												Omanhene of Wassa Fiase by 
												persons who, according to the 
												applicant, had no right to do 
												so.&nbsp; This new Omanhene is 
												Osagyefo Kwamena Enimil VI, the 
												interested party in this suit.
