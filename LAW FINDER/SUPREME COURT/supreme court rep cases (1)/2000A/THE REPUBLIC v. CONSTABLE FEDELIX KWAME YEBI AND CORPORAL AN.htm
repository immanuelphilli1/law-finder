												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On&nbsp; 15th July,&nbsp; 1997, Constable 
												Yebbi and Cpl. Avalifo were 
												arraigned before the Greater 
												Accra Regional Tribunal on 
												charges of conspiracy to steal 
												and stealing ¢100,000,000.00 
												contrary to section 23(1) and 
												124(1)&nbsp; respectively of the 
												Criminal Code 1960 (Act 29). The 
												money is said to belong to the 
												National Democratic Congress (NDC), 
												a political party registered 
												under the Political Parties 
												Registration Law 1992, (PNDCL 
												281).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the course of the trial the 
												accused challenged the 
												jurisdiction of the tribunal. 
												They pointed out that under 
												Article 143(1) of the 1992 
												Constitution, a regional 
												tribunal has jurisdiction to try 
												such offences against the state 
												and public interest as 
												Parliament may by law prescribe. 
												But the offences they were 
												facing could not be said to be 
												against the state or public 
												interest since the money 
												involved was admitted to belong 
												to a political party which 
												obviously is not a state 
												institution, neither is the 
												theft of a political party's 
												money, an offence against public 
												interest. A Regional Tribunal 
												can therefore not try such an 
												offence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The prosecution sought to resist 
												the objection by contending that 
												once Parliament has exercised 
												its discretion by enacting in 
												the Court's Act 1993 (Act 459) 
												section 24(1) thereof, that a 
												regional tribunal has 
												jurisdiction in all criminal 
												matters, it follows that the 
												tribunal was seised with 
												jurisdiction in the matter.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												But the accused in reply 
												submitted that section 24(1) of 
												Act 459 is not consistent with 
												Article 143(1) of the 1992 
												Constitution and consequently 
												null and void. They supported 
												their contention with the Court 
												of Appeal's decision in CA 
												16/97: Jonathan Dey vrs. The 
												Republic 12th February 1998 
												(unreported).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial Regional Tribunal 
												accordingly referred the 
												following issues to this court 
												under Article 130(2) of the 1992 
												Constitution:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												i. Whether on a true and proper 
												interpretation of Article 143(1) 
												Parliament had power to provide 
												that a Regional Tribunal had 
												jurisdiction in all criminal 
												matters.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												ii. Whether section 24(1) of the 
												Court's Act 1993 (Act 459) is 
												inconsistent with the said 
												Article 143(1) of the 1992 
												Constitution and to the extent 
												of such inconsistency void;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												iii. Whether or not the stealing 
												of monies belonging to a 
												political party is a crime 
												against the state or public 
												interest.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In Jonathan Dey vrs. The 
												Republic (supra) relied on by 
												accused at the Regional 
												Tribunal, the appellant who was 
												a store keeper of the 
												complainant, one Mrs. Bertha 
												Nunyuie at Ho, was charged with 
												one count of Stealing ¢4,999,400 
												and ¢2,224,600 being the 
												proceeds from the sale of cement 
												and drinks respectively. The 
												offence was alleged to have been 
												committed between 19th March and 
												4th April 1996. He was tried and 
												convicted by the Ho Regional 
												Tribunal and sentenced to 3 
												years I.H.L. In his appeal at 
												the Court of Appeal, he 
												contended, inter alia, that the 
												Regional Tribunal had no 
												jurisdiction in so far as the 
												offence levelled against him was 
												not against the State or public 
												interest as provided for in 
												Article 143(1) of the 1992 
												Constitution. He submitted that 
												the offence was against Mrs. 
												Bertha Nunyuie, a private 
												person, and that section 24(1) 
												of Act 459 which gave the 
												Regional Tribunal jurisdiction 
												in all criminal matters subject 
												to the Constitution and the 
												provisions of Act 459, was 
												inconsistent with Article 143(1) 
												of the 1992 Constitution.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Court of Appeal upheld the 
												arguments of Jonathan Dey and 
												concluded that the Regional 
												Tribunal had no jurisdiction in 
												the matter. As Foster J.A put 
												it.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;... the property charged to 
												have been stolen belonged to 
												Mrs. Bertha Nunyuie. It was not 
												owned by the state or a public 
												body. Nor was the property one 
												in which all the people of Ghana 
												could claim to be joint owners 
												with Mrs. Nunyuie, so as to 
												bring the offence of stealing 
												within the jurisdictional 
												competence of a Regional 
												Tribunal. In the light of the 
												considerations I have canvassed 
												in this opinion, the Regional 
												Tribunal had no jurisdiction to 
												try the appellant. I would 
												accordingly allow the appeal 
												quash the conviction, set aside 
												the sentence and discharge the 
												appellant&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Now until the above judgement of 
												the Court of Appeal is set 
												aside, the Regional Tribunal is 
												bound by Article 136(5) of the 
												1992 Constitution to follow the 
												questions of law settled in that 
												decision. The Article reads:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												136(5). Subject to clause (3) of 
												article 129 of this 
												Constitution, the Court of 
												Appeal shall be bound by its own 
												previous decisions; and all 
												courts lower than the Court of 
												Appeal shall follow the decision 
												of the Court of Appeal on 
												questions of law&quot; (emphasis 
												supplied).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Yet the Regional Tribunal herein 
												did not examine Jonathan Dey's 
												decision to determine whether it 
												offers answers to the questions 
												raised for determination of this 
												court. The obvious issue arising 
												therefrom is whether a lower 
												court can in the face of a 
												binding decision of a higher 
												court, refer questions already 
												determined in that decision to 
												the Supreme Court for 
												determination.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Of course, the Attorney-General 
												in his written submission, 
												paragraph 29 thereof, contended 
												that in so far as the Court of 
												Appeal purported to interpret 
												Article 143(1) of the 
												Constitution and by implication 
												rendered section 24(1) of Act 
												459 inconsistent with that 
												Article, the Court of Appeal 
												acted in clear breach of Article 
												130(1) of the Constitution and 
												consequently its decision was 
												invalid. Fair enough! But the 
												Regional Tribunal offered no 
												such explanation in failing to 
												follow that decision.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Be that as it may, the propriety 
												of this reference in the face of 
												the decision in Jonathan Dey's 
												case, has not been raised by 
												either party. Indeed it appears 
												that the reference was with the 
												consent of both parties. We 
												would therefore proceed to 
												examine the questions posed for 
												consideration.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The first two issues are indeed 
												two sides of the same coin. In 
												that, issue&nbsp; (1) arises from the 
												fact that section 24(1) of Act 
												459 vests regional tribunals 
												with original jurisdiction in 
												all criminal matters, subject of 
												course, to the provisions of the 
												1992 Constitution. And if the 
												said section 24(1) is 
												inconsistent with Article 143(1) 
												of the 1992 Constitution, then 
												it follows that Parliament has 
												no power to vest such original 
												jurisdiction in all criminal 
												matters in the regional 
												tribunals. Issue (2) will 
												therefore be dealt with first.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Now Article 143(1) of the 1992 
												Constitution provides:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;A regional tribunal shall have 
												jurisdiction to try such 
												offences against the State and 
												the public interest as 
												Parliament may by law 
												prescribe&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Compare the above provision with 
												Article 140(1) of the same 1992 
												Constitution dealing with the 
												jurisdiction of the High Court. 
												Article 140(1) provides</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;140(1) The High Court shall, 
												subject to the provisions of 
												this Constitution, have 
												jurisdiction in all matters and 
												in particular in civil and 
												criminal matters and such 
												original, appellate and other 
												jurisdiction as may be conferred 
												on it by this Constitution or 
												any other law&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The above provision clearly 
												gives to the High Court, 
												jurisdiction in all criminal and 
												civil matters subject to the 
												provisions of the Constitution. 
												Whereas the original 
												jurisdiction of the regional 
												Tribunal is confined to &quot;such 
												offences against the state and 
												public interest as Parliament 
												may by law prescribe&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												From the clear language of 
												Articles 140(1) and 143(1) the 
												High Court and Regional Tribunal 
												are not meant and were not 
												intended to have the same 
												original jurisdiction. Yet 
												section 24(1) of Act 459 
												provides:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Subject to the provisions of 
												the constitution, this Act and 
												any other law, a regional 
												Tribunal shall have concurrent 
												original jurisdiction with the 
												High Court in all criminal 
												matters and shall in 
												particular...&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the World Book Dictionary, 
												the word &quot;concurrent&quot; is 
												defined, inter alia, as &quot;having 
												equal authority or 
												jurisdiction&quot;. Certainly the 
												Constitution did not confer the 
												same or equal jurisdiction on 
												the High Court and the Regional 
												Tribunal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Furthermore the Constitution did 
												not grant the Regional Tribunal 
												jurisdiction in &#8220;all criminal 
												matters&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In his written submissions, the 
												Attorney-General attempts to 
												justify section 24(1) of Act 459 
												by submitting that all crimes 
												are by definition, offences 
												against the State and the public 
												interest and therefore by 
												providing that regional 
												tribunals have original 
												jurisdiction in all criminal 
												matters, no inconsistency is 
												created between such a provision 
												and Article 143(1).&nbsp; For under 
												section 1 of Act 29, the word 
												&#8216;offence&#8217; has the same meaning 
												as the word &#8216;crime&#8217;. He further 
												quotes from page 27 of A.N.E. 
												Amissah&#8217;s Criminal Procedure in 
												Ghana, wherein it is stated:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The theory of crime is that 
												crimes are wrongs against the 
												state which ought to be 
												prosecuted by the State itself.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Now it cannot be doubted that 
												jurisprudentially, every crime 
												is an offence against the State. 
												As defined in Baron&#8217;s Law 
												Dictionary, crime is</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Any act which the sovereign has 
												deemed contrary to the public 
												good; a wrong which the 
												government has determined 
												injurious to the public and 
												hence, prosecutable in a 
												criminal proceedings&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												But within this broad or general 
												sense, it cannot be denied that 
												some crimes are meant to protect 
												the person of the individual; 
												others to protect the peace and 
												security of the state; while 
												others protect the environment, 
												administration of justice, 
												public office and so on. Thus in 
												Russell on Crimes, offences are 
												divided into twelve broad areas. 
												These cover offences against the 
												security of the state; 
												disturbance of the public peace; 
												the due administration of 
												justice; public office; the 
												person, status and reputation of 
												the individual; property public 
												or private, nuisance and kindred 
												offences; trade; criminal 
												conspiracy; rights and revenue 
												of the Crown; religion and 
												public worship; and finally the 
												law of nations.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Again the criminal Code 1960 
												(Act 29) treats offences under 
												four main parts. Apart from part 
												one which covers preliminary 
												matters, attempts to commit 
												crimes, abetment and conspiracy, 
												part two deals with offences 
												against the person; part three 
												covers offences against rights 
												of property; and part four deals 
												with offences against public 
												order, health and morality.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There are therefore divisions 
												within the broad definition of a 
												crime. And the framers of the 
												Constitution cannot be said to 
												be unaware of these divisions. 
												The very fact that Article 
												143(1) talks of &quot;such offences 
												against the state and public 
												interest&quot; while Article 140(1) 
												talks of &quot;all matters and in 
												particular, in civil and 
												criminal matters&#8221; clearly shows 
												that the drafters were fully 
												aware of the divisions within 
												crime, and therefore intended to 
												confine regional tribunals to 
												&#8220;such offences against the state 
												and public interest&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Furthermore from the proceedings 
												of the Consultative Assembly 
												which drew up the draft of the 
												1992 Constitution, it is 
												evidently clear that after much 
												debate on the status and 
												jurisdiction of the public 
												tribunals, it was finally agreed 
												that the public tribunals should 
												be part of the unified judicial 
												system but with jurisdiction in 
												certain criminal cases only. Not 
												in all criminal cases as, 
												section 24(1) of Act 459 now 
												provides. For as Mr. Kofi Attor 
												(CDR) put it, the public 
												tribunal established under the 
												PNDC be retained</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;as part of a unified judicial 
												system with jurisdiction to 
												cover economic crimes, treason, 
												insurrection, rebellion, 
												narcotics and other crimes 
												against&nbsp; the state&#8221; See: No. 1 
												Col. 257 of the Proceedings.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												To attempt therefore in section 
												24(1) of Act 459 to vest 
												original jurisdiction in all 
												criminal matters in the Regional 
												Tribunals, does not only negate 
												the clear and unambiguous 
												language of Article 143(1) of 
												the 1992 Constitution, but also 
												the intention of the framers of 
												the Constitution.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												But the Attorney-General further 
												submits that to restrict the 
												original jurisdiction of the 
												Regional Tribunal to offences 
												against the state and public 
												interest would disable the 
												Regional Tribunals from 
												entertaining appeals from the 
												Community and Circuit Tribunals 
												in offences other than those 
												affecting the state and public 
												interest. For as he points out, 
												the appellate jurisdiction of 
												the regional Tribunals according 
												to Article 143(2) is in relation</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;to matters described in clause 
												(1) of this Article, as may be 
												prescribed by law&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In our opinion therefore section 
												24(1) of Act 459 which vests in 
												the Regional Tribunal concurrent 
												original jurisdiction in all 
												criminal matters with the High 
												Court, is clearly inconsistent 
												with the letter and spirit of 
												the 1992 Constitution. And by 
												Article 1(2) thereof, same is 
												null and void. It follows that 
												on a true and proper 
												interpretation of Article 143(1) 
												Parliament had no power to 
												provide that a Regional Tribunal 
												had jurisdiction in all criminal 
												matters.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As already noted, Article 143(1) 
												empowers Regional Tribunals to 
												try &quot;such offences against the 
												state and the public interest&quot; 
												as Parliament may by law 
												prescribe. Is the word 'and' 
												coming in between 'state' and 
												'public interest' in the 
												provision, to be read as 
												disjunctive or conjunctive? In 
												other words does it mean that 
												any such offence should be 
												against both the state and the 
												public interest;- or is it 
												enough if the offence is either 
												against the state or against 
												public interest?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Generally the word 'and' is 
												conjunctive and 'or' 
												disjunctive. But to carry out 
												the intention of the legislature 
												it may be necessary to read 
												'and' in place of the 
												disjunction 'or' and vice versa: 
												Anisminic Ltd. vrs. Foreign 
												Compensation Commission (1969) 1 
												All ER 208 HL.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Thus in R. vrs. Newbound (1962) 
												2 QB 102 Winn J held that the 
												expression &quot;local and public 
												authorities in section 4(2) of 
												the Prevention of Corruption Act 
												1961 did not &quot;mean authorities 
												which are both local and public 
												&#8230;[but] authorities which are 
												either local or public.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Again in John G. Stein &amp; Co. 
												Ltd. vrs O'Halloran (1965) AC 
												890, section 48(1) of the Mines 
												and Quarries Act 1954 provided:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;It shall be the duty of the 
												manager of every mine to take, 
												with respect to every road and 
												working place in the mine, such 
												steps by way of controlling 
												movement of the strata in the 
												mine and supporting the roof and 
												sides of the road or working 
												place as may be necessary for 
												keeping the road or working 
												place secure&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Lord Reid said at page 904 
												thereof, that he could not</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;suppose that it was intended 
												that in every case the manager 
												must both attempt to control 
												movement of the strata and 
												provide support&nbsp; ... the natural 
												meaning of the words of the 
												section is that one or other of 
												the prescribed methods must be 
												adopted in every case&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the instant case, we are not 
												dealing with an ordinary Act of 
												parliament but a national 
												Constitution. And unless there 
												are compelling reasons for 
												interpreting the word 'and' in 
												Article 143(1) as being only 
												conjunctive, it would be more 
												desirable to interpret it 
												liberally to encompass both 
												conjunctive and disjunctive. 
												Thus Regional Tribunals can try 
												such offences against both the 
												state and the public interest, 
												or against the state or against 
												the public interest. The &#8216;and&#8217; 
												is therefore to be read as 
												&quot;and/or&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The next issue then is whether 
												the stealing of monies belonging 
												to a political party, is an 
												offence against the state and/or 
												public interest?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Certainly under our present 
												system, a political party is not 
												a state institution in the sense 
												that it is not set up nor owned 
												by the state. And therefore the 
												theft of its money cannot be 
												said to be a theft of state 
												money. But is it an offence 
												against public interest?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Article 295(1) of the 1992 
												Constitution defines public 
												interest as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;public interest includes any 
												right or advantage which enures 
												or is intended to enure to the 
												benefit generally of the whole 
												of the people of Ghana&quot;. 
												(emphasis supplied)</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is significant to note that 
												the word used in defining public 
												interest is 'includes' and not 
												&#8216;means&#8217;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The word 'means' when used in 
												defining a word usually implies 
												that the meaning of the word is 
												restricted to the scope 
												indicated in the definition 
												section. On the other hand, the 
												word 'includes' is often used</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;in order to enlarge the meaning 
												of word or phrases occurring in 
												the body of the statute;&nbsp; and 
												when it is so used these words 
												or phrase must be considered as 
												comprehending not only such 
												things which the interpretation 
												clause declares that they shall 
												include&quot;. Per Lord Watson in 
												Dilworth vrs. Commissioner of 
												Stamps (1899) AC 99 at 105.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In Robinson vrs. Barton-Eccles 
												Local Board (1883) 8 App Cas 798 
												it was held that the word in 
												respect of which 'includes' is 
												used bears both its extended 
												statutory meaning and its 
												ordinary, popular and natural 
												sense whenever that would be 
												applicable.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Again in Wagen-stein vrs. Graham 
												(1954) 4 DLR 540 at 542, 
												O'Holloran J.A. said</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;the latter word ('includes&#8217; in 
												a statutory definition) in 
												contrast to 'means' is inserted 
												in an interpretation section to 
												permit enlargement of the 
												meaning of terms occurring in 
												the body of the statute. It 
												signifies that which is 
												&quot;included&quot; is in addition to 
												some thing else that is not 
												specifically stated to be so 
												included and may not need to be 
												so included&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It follows therefore that the 
												word 'includes' used in defining 
												public interest in Article 
												295(1) does not restrict the 
												meaning of public interest to 
												the scope indicated in the 
												definition. For as was correctly 
												pointed out by the Attorney 
												General in his written 
												submissions, public interest 
												exists even if the interest is 
												only of a section of the 
												populace. Thus in Cartwright vrs 
												Post Office (1969) 1 All ER 421, 
												the placing of a telegraphic 
												line on persons land in order to 
												serve the households of two 
												adjoining framers was regarded 
												as of public interest in as much 
												as an efficient farming industry 
												was in the public interest. 
												Again in Miller vrs Hackson 
												(1977) 3All ER 338, the interest 
												of a village in preserving a 
												cricket ground for recreation 
												and enjoyment was seen as a 
												public interest which should 
												outweigh a private interest.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Now the NDC whose money is 
												alleged to have been stolen is 
												undoubtedly a political party 
												registered under the Political 
												Parties Law 1992 (PNDCL 281); 
												and by that registration the 
												party is deemed to have complied 
												with the relevant provisions set 
												out in the 1992 Constitution and 
												PNDCL 281. Article 55(1) of the 
												1992 Constitution provides that</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Every political party shall 
												have a national character, and 
												membership shall not be based on 
												ethnic, religious, regional or 
												other sectional divisions&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Again under Article 55(14) every 
												political party is required by 
												law</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;(a) to declare to the public 
												their revenues and assets and 
												the sources of those revenues 
												and assets; and</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) to publish to the public 
												annually their audited accounts&quot; 
												(emphasis supplied).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Accordingly section 19(1) of 
												PNDCL 281 provides that every 
												political party is obliged to 
												maintain at its head or national 
												office an accurate and permanent 
												record of the following:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) a list of its membership;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) any contribution, donation 
												or pledge of contribution or 
												donation whether in cash or in 
												kind made by the founding 
												members of the political party;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(c) a statement of its accounts, 
												showing the sources of its funds 
												and the name of any person who 
												has contributed to the funds, 
												membership dues paid, donations 
												in cash or in kind and all the 
												financial transactions of the 
												political party which are 
												conducted through, by or with 
												the head or national office of 
												the party;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(d) any property that belongs to 
												the political party and the time 
												and mode of acquisition of the 
												property; and</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(e) such other particulars as 
												the Commission may require with 
												respect to the foregoing or any 
												other matters.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Section 19 (3) requires every 
												political party to have its 
												accounts audited and published 
												once every year; while section 
												19(4) empowers each and every 
												member of the public to inspect 
												the said audited accounts on the 
												payment of a fee.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Why should our law impose such 
												heavy burden on political 
												parties, and further lay bare 
												their affairs and finances to 
												the view and scrutiny of the 
												general public?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The answer lies in the 
												experiences of our past history 
												and the recognition of the 
												importance of political parties 
												in democratic government 
												worldwide. For notwithstanding 
												the minuses of political 
												parties, it has now become 
												universally accepted that 
												political parties are 
												indispensable mechanism for the 
												conduct of truly democratic 
												government. Lord Bryce, in his 
												Modern Democracies 1921, points 
												out that political parties are 
												inevitable and that no free 
												country has been without them. 
												While he agrees that many people 
												at different times have attacked 
												the evils of the party system, 
												yet no one has shown how 
												representative government could 
												be worked without them. For him</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The parties keep a nation's 
												mind alive, as the rise and fall 
												of the sweeping tide freshens 
												the water of long ocean inlets. 
												Discussions within each party, 
												culminating before elections in 
												the adoption of platform, brings 
												certain issues to the front, 
												defines them, expresses them in 
												formulas which, even if tricky 
												and delusive, fix men's minds on 
												certain points, concentrating 
												attention and inviting 
												criticism. So few people think 
												seriously and steadily upon any 
												subject outside the range of 
												their own business interest that 
												public opinion might be vague 
												and effective if the party 
												searchlight were not constantly 
												turned on&quot;. (quoted at page 107 
												of the Memorandum on the 
												proposals for a Constitution 
												1968)</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												For the above and other reasons, 
												we the people of Ghana on our 
												quest for a good Governance 
												recognised that political 
												parties would enable us in 
												achieving our objective of 
												establishing </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;a framework of government which 
												shall secure for ourselves and 
												posterity the blessings of 
												liberty, equality of opportunity 
												and prosperity&quot; - See the 
												Preamble to the 1992 
												Constitution.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												And as the late Professor E.A. 
												Boateng noted at page 37 his 
												book, Government and the People 
												1996:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Because of the pre-eminence of 
												their role in the political 
												process, political parties have 
												now become virtually the only 
												basis for contesting political 
												power in democratic countries. 
												Their organisation mode of 
												operation, their finances and 
												objectives are accordingly 
												matter of widespread public 
												interest&#8221;. (emphasis supplied)</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is therefore clear that from 
												the elaborate legal requirements 
												and the hopes and aspirations of 
												Ghanaians in political parties 
												to secure for them the earthly 
												kingdom of Heaven, political 
												parties are an essential part of 
												the framework of government, and 
												that their operations and 
												finances are controlled by the 
												State and the public at large.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Accordingly, if the NDC alleges 
												that its ¢100,000,000.00 had 
												been stolen, the members of the 
												party who are owners therefore 
												are obviously interested in 
												ensuring that those at fault are 
												brought to book. The very fact 
												that the theft affects directly 
												the members of the party, does 
												not mean that no public interest 
												exists in the theft. As already 
												demonstrated, and further held 
												in R. vrs. Sussex Confirming 
												Authority, ex parte Tamplin &amp; 
												Sons Brewery (Brighton) Ltd. 
												(1937) 4 All ER 106 at 112 per 
												Justice Parcq:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;It is fallacious to say that a 
												condition is not in the public 
												interest, or may not be in the 
												public interest, if it is the 
												case that a great many of those 
												persons who constitute the 
												public are not directly affected 
												by it; and it is equally 
												fallacious to say that a 
												condition cannot be in the 
												public interest if a great many 
												members of the public neither 
												know nor care anything about 
												it&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												At page 108 Lord Hewart LCJ put 
												it this way:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;If the condition is in the 
												interests of a considerable part 
												of the public, then it is true 
												to say that it is in the 
												interests of the public, of 
												which that is a part. It would, 
												I think, be fantastic to argue 
												that a condition cannot be in 
												the interests of the public 
												unless it is in the interest of 
												every part of the public &#8230; If it 
												is in the interests of the 
												public concerned, then it is in 
												the interests of the public as a 
												whole&quot;. (Emphasis supplied)</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												But in the instant case, the 
												alleged theft of the money is 
												not in the interest of only the 
												members of the NDC, but also the 
												entire Ghanaian public who are 
												by law entitled to inspect and 
												take copies of the audited 
												accounts of the NDC.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It cannot therefore be denied 
												that under our law governing the 
												establishment and running of 
												political parties, the theft of 
												money belonging to a political 
												party is an offence against the 
												public interest. Indeed the 
												numerous press comments in the 
												various newspapers and talk 
												shows at the various FM Radio 
												Stations on the alleged theft 
												testify to the general public 
												interest in the matter.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Accordingly we answer the issues 
												posed for our determination as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												i. On a true and proper 
												interpretation of Article 
												143(1), Parliament had NO power 
												to provide that a Regional 
												Tribunal had jurisdiction in all 
												criminal matters.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												ii. Accordingly that part of 
												section 24(1), which reads that 
												&quot;a Regional Tribunal shall have 
												concurrent original jurisdiction 
												with the High Court in all 
												criminal matters&quot; is 
												inconsistent with the said 
												Article 143(1) of the 1992 
												Constitution and to the extent 
												of such inconsistency, void.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The remaining part of section 
												24(1), (a)(b)(c) are consistent 
												with Article 143(1).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												iii. The stealing of monies 
												belonging to a political party 
												is a crime against public 
												interest.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Consequently the Regional
