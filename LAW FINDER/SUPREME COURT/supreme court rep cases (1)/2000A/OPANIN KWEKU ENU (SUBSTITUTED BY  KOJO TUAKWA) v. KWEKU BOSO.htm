												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												SOPHIA AKUFFO, J.S.C.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On February 14th 2001, we 
												unanimously allowed the appeal 
												herein but reserved our reasons, 
												which we now give as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In this appeal against the 
												judgment of the Court of Appeal 
												dated June 17th 1999, the 
												Appellant set out his grounds of 
												appeal in rather prolix terms.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												These may however, be briefly 
												summarised as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												a. The Court of Appeal erred in 
												not assessing the evidence 
												before the trial court to 
												ascertain whether or not the 
												evidence supported the trial 
												court's judgment.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												b. The Court of Appeal erred in 
												proceeding on the assumption 
												that the matter before the trial 
												court turned solely on the facts 
												and thereby ignored issues of 
												law, which had been raised by 
												the evidence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												c. Since the appellant's claim 
												was for a declaration of title 
												and the respondent had not 
												counterclaimed for a similar 
												declaration, or at all, the 
												Court of Appeal erred in 
												upholding the trial court's 
												order that 'the status quo ante 
												should be maintained'.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The background to this appeal is 
												that, the appellant, on his own 
												behalf and as the Head of the 
												Aburadze family of Gwira 
												Akyinimu, claimed against the 
												respondent for declaration of 
												title to two pieces of land 
												known as Gwira Akyinimu, in the 
												Edina Traditional Area, and 
												orders for recovery of 
												possession and perpetual 
												injunction.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellant's case was to the 
												effect, that the disputed lands 
												were originally broken and 
												settled by his ancestor Kwesi 
												Gwira, the first Odikro, who had 
												been accompanied by his sister, 
												Tseasewa. In the course of time, 
												according to the appellant, a 
												member of the defendant's family 
												married the niece of the Odikro 
												and, as a result of the 
												marriage, Gwira promised that 
												farming land would be made 
												available to members of the 
												respondent's family who wished 
												to farm, and this became an 
												established practice. Also, 
												according to the appellant, when 
												the respondent himself needed 
												land for a salt industry, he had 
												approached Nana Gwira III and 
												requested an allocation, which 
												request had been granted after 
												the&nbsp; performance of custom. 
												However, the respondent had, 
												without the consent of the 
												Odikro, attempted to extend the 
												area of his allocation, and, 
												moreover, had been claiming 
												ownership of the entire land and 
												purporting to sell portions 
												thereof, thereby precipitating 
												the suit.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												For his part, the respondent, 
												asserted that the lands were the 
												family's ancestral property and 
												that, therefore, he needed no 
												permission or consent from the 
												appellant to alienate any part. 
												The respondent also claimed that 
												the founder, Kwesi Gwira was his 
												ancestor who hailed from the 
												Adwenadze (Aowin) family of 
												Bantama near Elmina. According 
												to the respondent, Kwesi Gwira 
												married Tseasewa who was from 
												Anomabu and was the ancestress 
												of the appellant. After Kwesi 
												Gwira died, his children were 
												permitted to farm on the lands 
												and function as caretakers for 
												their father's Adwenadze family, 
												provided they paid annual homage 
												to the family's Stool at 
												Bantama. In further support of 
												his contention, the respondent 
												asserted that, during the time 
												of one of the appellant's 
												predecessors, Kofi Gin (or Kofi 
												Gyem), an attempt was made by 
												the appellant's family to 
												enstool a chief at Gwira 
												Akyinimu, without the requisite 
												prior reference to the 
												respondent's family, as a result 
												of which the Head of the 
												respondent's family swore the 
												Great Oath of Elmina on the said 
												predecessor.&nbsp; Consequently, the 
												matter was arbitrated upon and 
												it was made clear to the 
												appellant's family that it could 
												not enstool anyone at Gwira 
												Akyinimu without the prior 
												consent and permission of the 
												respondent's family. The 
												appellant's family then 
												slaughtered a sheep to appease 
												the respondent's family. The 
												respondent also contended that 
												his family, as the landowners, 
												had at various times made grants 
												of portions of the land and had 
												also, upon the request of the 
												appellant, made grants to the 
												Oman of Gwira Akyinimu and had 
												otherwise exercised acts of 
												ownership on the lands without 
												any protest from the appellant 
												or his family. Therefore, the 
												respondent contended further 
												that the appellant was estopped 
												by the arbitration award, by his 
												conduct and acquiescence and by 
												the respondent's long and quiet 
												possession, from claiming title 
												to the lands.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Subsequently, four other persons 
												successfully applied to be 
												joined as co-plaintiffs claiming 
												that, when the trial court 
												ordered a survey of the property 
												in dispute, the areas pointed 
												out by the respondent for 
												demarcation as his property 
												encroached onto their respective 
												properties. The co-plaintiffs 
												are not Appellants herein.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the Court of Appeal, the 
												appellant's original ground of 
												appeal was simply that the 
												decision of the trial court was 
												against the weight of the 
												evidence. Subsequently, and with 
												the leave of the Court of 
												Appeal, he argued on additional 
												grounds to the effect that:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												a. The trial judge did not apply 
												any principle of law in his 
												judgement and thereby fell into 
												error.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												b. The trial Judge failed to 
												appreciate that since the 
												appellant had been in 
												undisturbed possession of the 
												land in dispute for several 
												years, his possession was good 
												title against the whole world 
												except someone with better title 
												and because of this lack of 
												appreciation, the Judge 
												erroneously ignored the burden 
												on the respondent to prove his 
												title.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Afreh, J. A. read the judgement 
												of the Court of Appeal. In&nbsp; 
												respect of&nbsp; additional ground 
												one, the court held that, where 
												only issues of fact arise for 
												determination in a case and they 
												can be resolved&nbsp; without any 
												citation of law, then the judge 
												is not bound to refer to, 
												analyse or apply any legal 
												principles, provided the 
												decision is not contrary to the 
												law or can be supported in law.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Additional ground two was the 
												only ground the Court considered 
												to be worthy of its attention. 
												Their Lordships, however, found 
												that the trial judge had 
												adequately considered the 
												evidence and reached conclusions 
												that were reasonable in the 
												light of the evidence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												With regard to the third ground 
												of appeal, Afreh, J.A. stated 
												that the trial judge did not, 
												and was not bound to, direct 
												himself on the question of 
												burden of proof, and by the very 
												fact that he came to a 
												conclusion, it can be assumed 
												that he knew and applied the law 
												on burden of proof in a civil 
												case. Consequently, he held 
												that, unless the appellant could 
												show that there was insufficient 
												or no evidence to support the 
												judgement, there was hardly any 
												point in the appeal court being 
												asked to consider the question 
												of burden of proof.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												With all due respect to the 
												learned judges of the Court of 
												Appeal, we find their 
												conclusions to be rather odd. 
												The adjudication process is 
												nothing if it is not a process 
												guided by law.&nbsp; Admittedly, a 
												judge is not required to cite 
												any particular law in every 
												case, particularly where it 
												turns essentially on the facts, 
												however, the evaluation of 
												evidence is a legal process and 
												the law of evidence is expected 
												to be and must be seen to have 
												been applied fully and without 
												any exception, save such 
												exceptions as are permitted by 
												the law. Thus, whether or not 
												the trial judge makes specific 
												reference to the particular 
												legal provisions he applies in 
												the evaluation of evidence, the 
												law of evidence must run as the 
												undercurrent guiding the flow of 
												his assessment and if the 
												outcome of the exercise is such 
												that it is alleged that the 
												trial judge's evaluation offends 
												against the applicable rules of 
												evidence, it is incumbent on an 
												appellate court to review the 
												record in the light of the rules 
												of evidence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Furthermore, an appeal is by way 
												of a rehearing, particularly 
												where the appellant alleges in 
												his notice of appeal that the 
												decision of the trial court is 
												against the weight of the 
												evidence. In such a case, 
												although it is not the function 
												of the appellate court to 
												evaluate the veracity or 
												otherwise of any witness, it is 
												incumbent upon an appellate 
												court, in a civil case, to 
												analyse the entire record of 
												appeal, take into account the 
												testimonies and all documentary 
												evidence adduced at the trial 
												before it arrives at its 
												decision, so as to satisfy 
												itself that, on a preponderance 
												of the probabilities, the 
												conclusions of the trial judge 
												are reasonably or amply 
												supported by the evidence. It is 
												our view that the Court of 
												Appeal in this case failed to do 
												this.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In our opinion, neither the 
												trial judge nor the Court of 
												Appeal properly applied the 
												rules of evidence. The 
												appellant's main case before the 
												Court of Appeal was that, in 
												evaluating the evidence, the 
												trial judge proceeded on the 
												assumption that the appellant 
												&quot;had a burden greater than 
												producing evidence which was 
												reasonably more probable than 
												that of the defendant.&quot;&nbsp; Part II 
												(dealing with the burden of 
												proof) of the Evidence Decree, 
												1975 (NRCD 323), Section 12 
												provides as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;12(1) Except as otherwise 
												provided by law, the burden of 
												persuasion requires proof by a 
												preponderance of the 
												probabilities.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) 'Preponderance of the 
												probabilities' means that degree 
												of certainty of belief in the 
												mind of the tribunal of fact or 
												the court by which it is 
												convinced that the existence of 
												a fact is more probable than its 
												non-existence.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Although the Decree makes 
												mention of the 'belief in the 
												mind of the court or the 
												tribunal of fact', it goes 
												without saying that such belief 
												must be founded upon and guided 
												by the totality of the evidence 
												on record.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In explaining the significance 
												of the innovations introduced by 
												the Evidence Decree, 
												particularly in the allocation 
												of the burden of proof in 
												actions, such as this one, for a 
												declaration of title, this 
												court, in Odonkor vrs. Amartei, 
												[1992-93] part 1 GBR, 59, held 
												that the principle that a 
												plaintiff in an action for 
												declaration of title must win on 
												the strength of his case and not 
												on the weakness of the 
												defendant' case no longer held 
												sway in Ghana. Rather, under the 
												Decree, the judge in all civil 
												cases, must consider the 
												relative merits of the case on a 
												preponderance of the 
												probabilities, rather than 'on 
												an archaic principle which might 
												not accord with reason or common 
												sense.'</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The fundamental question before 
												the trial judge was 'who is the 
												owner of the lands in dispute?' 
												The trial Judge concluded that:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;From the totality of the 
												evidence led, I find as a fact 
												that Gwira came from Bantama and 
												belonged to the Defendant's 
												family and he broke the virgin 
												forest. He was said to be Nana 
												Gwira I because he founded the 
												village. That is quite normal 
												since some heads of family are 
												titled &quot;Nana&quot; just like the 
												Plaintiff herein. I find 
												Tseasewa hailed from Anomabu and 
												was married to Kwesi Gwira. I 
												find Tseasewa's people also came 
												from Anomabu and were allowed to 
												occupy the land as caretakers 
												and were to pay annual tolls of 
												a sheep and eighteen shillings 
												cash to the Defendant's family. 
												I also find that the Plaintiff's 
												family were entitled to a 
												one-third share of anything 
												taken from any tenant placed on 
												the land. With this 
												relationship, it appears that 
												the Defendant had allowed the 
												Plaintiff complete control over 
												the land subject to their 
												observing these terms. 
												Therefore, the Plaintiff could 
												not claim absolute ownership of 
												the land however long they had 
												been on the land. In the same 
												vein, the Defendant could not 
												by-pass the Plaintiffs family 
												and without informing them grant 
												portions of the land to other 
												persons.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												So, what was the totality of the 
												evidence as at the close of the 
												trial? It was not in dispute 
												that the original settler of the 
												land was Nana Gwira. The problem 
												was that both parties, although 
												they did not belong to the same 
												family, claimed Gwira as their 
												ancestor. The Appellant, in his 
												evidence-in-chief traced his 
												connection to Gwira as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;My ancestor Nana Kwesi Gwira 
												cultivated the land with his 
												sister Aberewa Aba Tseasewa, and 
												their mother was called Aba Awen. 
												Nana Kwesi Gwira and Aba 
												Tseasewa had other brothers and 
												sisters but they all died 
												leaving only the two survivors. 
												Aba Tseasewa had children 
												namely, Brodwemaba, Amoesiwa, 
												Aba Mansah. Brodwemaba begat 
												Akosua Tawiah, Kweku Ainoo, 
												Kobina Anowa and Ahema. Akosua 
												Amoesiwa begat Adwoa Praba and 
												Kwesi Gwira. Aba Mansah begat 
												Atta Panyin and Atta Kakra and 
												Madam Tawiah. I came from the 
												line of Aba Mansah.&nbsp; Madam 
												Tawiah begat my mother called 
												Nana Amma... On the death of 
												Nana Kwesi Gwira, he was 
												succeeded by Nana Kobina Essuon 
												who was also a member of the 
												family. Nana Kobina Essuon was 
												succeeded by Kwesi Tawiah on 
												whose death E.K. Osei succeeded. 
												E.K. Osei is still alive.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Respondent did not 
												significantly challenge this 
												crucial portion of the evidence 
												on cross-examination. As for the 
												Respondent, apart from his bare 
												assertion that Gwira was his 
												ancestor, nowhere in his 
												pleadings or testimony, did he 
												establish any connection 
												whatsoever between his family 
												and Gwira. Nor did he produce 
												any witnesses to establish any 
												such connection. Thus, the 
												finding that Gwira hailed from 
												the Respondent's family had no 
												support from the evidence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Rather his Lordship, in total 
												disregard of the stipulations of 
												the above-quoted provisions of 
												the Evidence Decree, took the 
												stance that, since P.W.2 
												testified that Aba Tseasewa was 
												from Anomabu and she was 
												doubtlessly the ancestor of the 
												Appellant, then it followed that 
												the Respondent's story was the 
												correct version. In the light of 
												the provisions of the said 
												Decree, this conclusion was, 
												with all due respect to the 
												learned trial judge, a 
												non-sequitor.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Additionally, the judge 
												completely disregarded the 
												glaring fact that:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												a. All the Plaintiffs (owners of 
												adjoining properties, whose 
												claims he found as established), 
												knew only the Appellant's family 
												as the owners of the land, and 
												did not know the Respondent's 
												family as such;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												b. The Respondent clearly had 
												no,knowledge of the boundaries 
												of the subject matter in dispute 
												between him and the Appellant, 
												which lack of knowledge was the 
												catalyst for the joinder of the 
												co- plaintiffs to the suit;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												c. Equally, the Respondent had a 
												total lack of knowledge of who 
												was the current Chief of the 
												village, even though according 
												to him, as a consequence of his 
												family's over-lordship of the 
												land, the installation of such a 
												Chief necessitated the prior 
												consent of his family;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												d. According to P.W.l's 
												testimony, at the swearing in of 
												Nana Gwira IV, (at which time 
												he, the witness, was the acting 
												Omanhin of Edina Traditional 
												Area) the said chief (a member 
												of the Appellant's family) was 
												accompanied only by the elders 
												of his Abiradze stool family, 
												and although, according to 
												custom,&quot; ...The person who gives 
												the permission must also appear 
												before the Omanhin during the 
												swearing-in-ceremony ... nothing 
												of the sort happened, that 
												person has to inform the Omanhin 
												he gave the stool to the person 
												coming to swear the oath.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In such circumstances, the 
												preponderance of the 
												probabilities, clearly, stood in 
												favour of the Appellant and in 
												the absence of any cogent 
												evidence from the Respondent 
												shifting the probabilities in 
												his favour one is hard put to 
												find any justification for the 
												Trial Judge's finding that Gwira 
												belonged to the Respondent's 
												family.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Regarding the payment of tolls 
												to the Respondent, his Lordship 
												relied entirely on the testimony 
												of the Respondent's sole 
												witness, D.W.1, the bulk of 
												whose knowledge was derived from 
												what he was told by his father 
												nearly 90 years previously, even 
												though this witness' testimony 
												varied in many respects with 
												that of the Respondent. Other 
												portions of this witness's 
												evidence worthy of note are:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												All in all, what is most 
												apparent from the record is 
												that, the Judge simply chose to 
												disregard the evidence produced 
												by the Appellant, without any 
												serious evaluation, and 
												accepted, wholesale, the 
												assertions of the Respondent, 
												despite the dearth of adequate 
												supportive evidence. 
												Consequently, there is no doubt 
												in our minds that the Judge 
												erroneously placed the burden of 
												proof solely on the Appellant 
												and virtually assigned none 
												whatsoever to the Respondent. 
												After reviewing the record, it 
												was, therefore, our conclusion 
												that, on a preponderance of the 
												probabilities, the judgement of 
												the trial Judge was not 
												supported by the totality of the 
												evidence and the Court of Appeal 
												erred in confirming the same 
												without any scrutiny of the 
												record.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												We, therefore, set aside the 
												judgement and orders of the 
												trial court and enter judgement 
												for the Appellant on all his 
												claims.</span></p>
