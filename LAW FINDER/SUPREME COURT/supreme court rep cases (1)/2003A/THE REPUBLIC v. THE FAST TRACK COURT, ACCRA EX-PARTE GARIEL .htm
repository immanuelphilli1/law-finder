												PROF. KLUDZE, J.S.C.:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(Read the Opinion of the Court) 
												The Applicant is asking us for 
												two reliefs, either cumulatively 
												or in the alternative. In either 
												case, the result will be to 
												disqualify Mr Justice D. K. 
												Afreh, Justice of the Supreme 
												Court, from sitting as an 
												Additional Judge of the High 
												Court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In seeking to disqualify Mr 
												Justice Afreh, the Applicant 
												argues that on a proper reading 
												of Article 145(2)(b) of the 
												Constitution, he is not 
												competent to sit in the High 
												Court because he has passed the 
												age of 65 which is the 
												prescribed maximum age for High 
												Court Judges.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Applicant also argues that, 
												in any event, having attained 
												the age of 70 years in March, Mr 
												Justice Afreh cannot continue to 
												sit in any Court except for a 
												six month period to complete 
												cases which had been commenced 
												before him pursuant to Article 
												145(2) of the Constitution. In 
												support of this second ground, 
												the Applicant says that, 
												although Mr Justice Afreh had 
												dealt with some interlocutory 
												matters in their case, the 
												proceedings had not actually 
												commenced before him within the 
												intendment of Article 145(4) of 
												the Constitution.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As regards Mr Justice Afreh&quot;s 
												capacity to sit as an Additional 
												Judge of the High Court, the 
												Applicant's contention is that, 
												Article 145(2)(b) squarely 
												catches him and disqualifies 
												him. We are accordingly urged to 
												read Article 145(2)(b) of the 
												Constitution. In our opinion, 
												Article 145(2)(b) of our 
												Constitution is unambiguous and 
												allows for no argument. It 
												expressly states that a Judge of 
												the High Court must retire on 
												attainment of 65 years of age. 
												It means that a High Court Judge 
												must vacate his office upon 
												attainment of 65 years, 
												otherwise, excepting for the 
												grace period of six months to 
												wind up cases by virtue of 
												Article 145(4), anything done by 
												him thereafter is a nullity. It 
												also implies that a person who 
												is 65 years or older cannot be 
												appointed to the office of Judge 
												of the High Court. Therefore, 
												the Applicant extrapolates from 
												these valid premises to contend 
												that, as Mr Justice Afreh had 
												attained the age of 65, his 
												designation as an Additional 
												Judge of the High Court by the 
												Chief Justice is in 
												contravention of a clear and 
												undebatable provision of the 
												Constitution, to wit Article 
												145(2)(b) thereof. The logic of 
												the Applicant's position is 
												that, if Mr Justice Afreh was 
												not qualified to hold the office 
												of a High Court Judge by reason 
												of his age, the Chief Justice 
												cannot appoint him as an 
												Additional Judge of the High 
												Court where he is 
												constitutionally prohibited from 
												sitting. We agree with the 
												Applicant that if Mr Justice 
												Afreh is disqualified from 
												sitting in the High Court, the 
												Chief Justice or the President 
												of the Republic of Ghana must 
												not be allowed to circumvent the 
												Constitution by installing him 
												there under a different guise. 
												The maxim of the law is what 
												Coke stated ages ago that quando 
												a liquid prohibetur fieri ex 
												dirceto prohibetur et obliquum: 
												when a thing is prohibited, it 
												cannot be done either directly 
												or indirectly with the purpose 
												of achieving the prohibited 
												result. The maxim applies even 
												more forcefully when the 
												prohibition is mandated by the 
												Constitution. The Constitution 
												is the fundamental law of the 
												land and every authority is 
												bound by its explicit 
												provisions, such as Article 
												145(2)(b). Therefore, the 
												question is whether the 
												designation of Mr Justice Afreh, 
												who is admittedly over 65 years 
												old, to sit as an Additional 
												Judge of the High Court, is an 
												attempt to circumvent the age 
												restriction imposed on High 
												Court Judges. If it is such an 
												attempt to do directly or 
												indirectly what the Constitution 
												forbids, we must declare it to 
												be unconstitutional and accede 
												to the Applicant's prayer by 
												issuing an order of prohibition 
												to stop him from so sitting.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The foregoing argument, however 
												ingenious, is fallacious. As we 
												understand it, Mr. Justice Afreh 
												is not being appointed a High 
												Court Judge. Therefore, Article 
												145(2)(b), which sets a 
												mandatory retirement age for 
												Justices of the High Court, does 
												not apply to him. In our 
												opinion, the case falls under 
												Article 139(1) of the 
												Constitution. It says:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;139. (1) The High Court shall 
												consist of:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) The Chief Justice;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) Not less than twenty 
												Justices of the High Court; and</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(c) Such other Justices of the 
												Superior Court of Judicature as 
												the Chief Justice may, by 
												writing signed by him, request 
												to sit as High Court Justices 
												for any period.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												That Article empowers the Chief 
												Justice to request, in writing 
												signed by him, a Justice of the 
												Superior Court of Judicature to 
												sit in the High Court. The only 
												requirement of this 
												constitutional provision is that 
												the person so requested must be 
												a Justice of a Superior Court. 
												In this context, it means that 
												the person requested by the 
												Chief Justice to sit in the High 
												Court, of which he would 
												otherwise not be a member, must 
												be a Justice of the Court of 
												Appeal or of the Supreme Court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Applicant, however, is 
												asking us to hold that Article 
												139(1)(c) must be read subject 
												to Article 145(2). In other 
												words, we are being invited to 
												add a proviso to Article 145(2) 
												of the Constitution to say 
												something to the effect that 
												&quot;'the person so requested shall 
												not be 65 years or older.&quot; We 
												know of no authority that 
												confers the power on this Court 
												to amend the Constitution of 
												Ghana. We must decline the 
												invitation.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In conferring authority on the 
												Chief Justice to request 
												Justices of the Court of Appeal 
												and the Supreme Court to sit in 
												the High Court, the framers of 
												the Constitution must be 
												presumed to know that, having 
												regard to the retiring age 
												prescribed for members of those 
												two courts, the Justices 
												receiving the request may have 
												passed the retiring age for High 
												Court Judges. The Constitution 
												nevertheless permits those 
												Justices to sit in the High 
												Court. It does not add any 
												proviso as to the age of any 
												person qualified to be so 
												requested. The only requirement 
												is that the Justice required to 
												sit in the High Court be a 
												Justice of the Superior Court of 
												Judicature.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												We cannot, under the cloak of 
												constitutional interpretation, 
												re-write the Constitution of 
												Ghana. Even in the area of 
												statutory interpretation, we 
												cannot amend a piece of 
												legislation because we dislike 
												its terms or because we suppose 
												that the lawgiver was mistaken 
												or unwise. Our responsibility is 
												greater when we interpret the 
												Constitution. We cannot and must 
												not substitute our wisdom for 
												the collective wisdom of the 
												framers of the Constitution.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Where the words of a statute are 
												unclear or ambiguous, it is only 
												then that we must try to apply 
												the well-known canons of 
												construction to ascertain and 
												enforce the law. Where the words 
												of a statute are clear, our duty 
												is to enforce the statute as 
												written. That is a fundamental 
												rule of constitutional and 
												statutory interpretation. We 
												intend to be faithful to that 
												principle and that tradition of 
												jurisprudence. We must not 
												insert our own words or remove 
												words from the legislation in 
												order to arrive at a conclusion 
												that we consider desirable or 
												socially acceptable. If we do 
												that, we usurp the legislative 
												function which has been 
												consigned to the legislator. 
												That is a prescription for 
												tyranny of the judicial branch 
												and a harbinger of 
												constitutional crisis, if not 
												chaos and anarchy.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the present case, the 
												constitutional provision in 
												Article 139(1) is clear and 
												unambiguous. If we tinker with 
												the words, we may very well 
												create our own self-induced 
												absurdity and internal 
												incoherence. That Article makes 
												the Chief Justice a member of 
												the High Court; but it does not 
												say that the Chief Justice can 
												only be a member of the High 
												Court if he happens to be under 
												65 years of age. In our opinion, 
												the Chief Justice, regardless of 
												his age, remains a member of the 
												High Court and may sit as a High 
												Court Judge for as long as he 
												holds the office of Chief 
												Justice. We do not question the 
												wisdom of that provision. That 
												is what our Constitution says. 
												If we impose an age limit on 
												Justices of the Superior Court 
												of Judicature who are requested 
												to sit in the High Court, 
												although the Constitution itself 
												imposes no such limit, we must 
												also impose an age limit of 65 
												years on a Chief Justice who is 
												a member of the High Court by 
												virtue of his office. We do not 
												have the power to do that; and 
												it would lead to internal 
												inconsistency of the 
												Constitution if we were to 
												embark upon such an adventure.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There are other parts of the 
												Constitution which would be 
												reduced to absurdity if we were 
												to take the Applicant's view 
												that all who perform the 
												functions of a High Court must 
												be below the age of 65. Under 
												Article 137 (3) of the 
												Constitution, the Court of 
												Appeal, when it disposes of an 
												appeal from the High Court, 
												&quot;shall have all the powers, 
												authority and jurisdiction 
												vested in the court from which 
												the appeal is brought.&quot; This 
												means that the Court of Appeal, 
												when it determines an appeal, 
												has all the powers of the High 
												Court. For this reason the Court 
												of Appeal may make appropriate 
												orders without remitting the 
												case back to the High Court. For 
												the purpose of exercising the 
												powers of the High Court, it is 
												not a constitutional requirement 
												that all the members of the 
												Appeal Court panel must be below 
												65 years. The Applicant is 
												asking us to interpret the 
												Constitution in such a way that 
												a decision of the Court of 
												Appeal, to the extent that it 
												involves the exercise of the 
												powers of the High Court as 
												mandated under Article 137(3), 
												shall be void if even one of the 
												three-member panel is 65 years 
												or older. Similarly, if a High 
												Court Judge aged 62 years, on 
												appeal, under Article 140 (5), 
												exercises the powers of a 
												Magistrate who as a judicial 
												officer must retire at age 60 
												under Article 150(2), the 
												decision of the High Court Judge 
												is not void or without 
												jurisdiction.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The other issue canvassed before 
												us is that, in any event, when 
												Mr Justice Afreh turned 70 on 
												March 25, 2003, he attained the 
												mandatory retirement age as a 
												Justice of the Supreme Court 
												and, therefore, could not 
												continue as an Additional Judge 
												of the High Court. The reason is 
												that only a Justice of the 
												Superior Court of Judicature can 
												be requested to sit as an 
												Additional Judge of the High 
												Court. It is conceded that under 
												Article 145(4), Mr Justice 
												Afreh, after his 70th birthday 
												may, if authorised, remain in 
												office to complete cases pending 
												before him. An affidavit from 
												the Judicial Secretary exhibited 
												a letter from His Lordship the 
												Chief Justice, Mr Justice E. K. 
												Wiredu, dated 25th March, 2003, 
												authorising Mr Justice Afreh to 
												remain in office for a period of 
												six months to enable him deliver 
												judgments in cases before him. 
												See Exhibit 2 attached to the 
												affidavit of the Judicial 
												Secretary. In response, the 
												Applicant argues that the Chief 
												Justice has the authority under 
												Article 145(4) to authorise a 
												Judge who had attained the 
												retirement age to remain in 
												office for further six months, 
												but only for the limited purpose 
												of completing pending cases. 
												Such authority cannot be granted 
												to try fresh cases.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												From the above premise, the 
												Applicant seeks Prohibition 
												against Mr Justice Afreh to stop 
												him from hearing the case 
												intituled Speedline Stevedoring 
												Co. Ltd. v. S. M. Kotei and 
												Another, because hearing had not 
												commenced before him prior to 
												his 25th birthday. The Applicant 
												attached Exhibit &quot;A&quot;, being the 
												proceedings in that case, in 
												proof that Mr Justice Afreh did 
												not begin to hear testimony in 
												the case until 27th March, 2003, 
												two days after he had turned 70. 
												The Applicant argues, therefore, 
												that this was not a case the 
												trial of which had commenced 
												before the Judge's compulsory 
												retirement date. If that is 
												true, Mr Justice Afreh lacked 
												the capacity and therefore, the 
												jurisdiction to try the case as 
												an Additional Judge of the High 
												Court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The thrust of the Applicant's 
												case is that the trial did not 
												commence before the Judge's 70th 
												birthday on March 25, 2003, 
												because the first witness was 
												not called until March 27. The 
												Applicant quoted a Statement by 
												Mr Justice Afreh on page 4 of 
												his Exhibit &quot;A&quot;, being the 
												proceedings of 14th March, 2003, 
												which can be interpreted, and 
												which he interprets, to mean 
												that trial had not begun and 
												would begin at a future date. 
												That future date, as Exhibit &quot;A&quot; 
												shows, was March 27th, two days 
												after Mr Justice Afreh's 
												birthday. For this reason, the 
												Applicant and also the 
												Respondent and Interested Party 
												have expended effort in 
												disputations as to when a trial 
												can be said to have commenced.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In popular parlance, we often 
												speak of &quot;part-heard&quot; cases. 
												These are usually cases in which 
												the court has received testimony 
												from some of the witnesses. They 
												are said to be part-heard 
												because the trial has not been 
												completed and judgment has not 
												been delivered. It is presumably 
												because of this conception or 
												misconception that all parties 
												have endeavoured to show that 
												the case of Speedline 
												Stevedoring Co., Ltd. v. S. M. 
												Kotei and Another did not become 
												part-heard until March 27, two 
												days after Mr Justice Afreh 
												turned 70, when the first 
												witness (P.W. 1) was called to 
												testify. If the dispensation for 
												retiring Justices was to permit 
												them to complete &quot;part-heard&quot;' 
												cases, we might devote greater 
												attention to the events that 
												have been related with regard to 
												the course of proceedings in 
												that case.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The constitutional dispensation, 
												however, does not concern 
												&quot;part-heard&quot; cases. In terms of 
												Article 145(4) of the 
												Constitution, a retiring Justice 
												may be permitted to remain in 
												office for a further period of 
												six months &quot;to enable him to 
												deliver judgment or do any other 
												thing in relation to proceedings 
												that were commenced before him 
												previous to his attaining that 
												age.&quot; It does not speak of 
												&quot;part-heard&quot; or &quot;part-tried&quot; 
												cases. The word &quot;trial&quot; and its 
												cognate forms is a terminology 
												of choice fastened upon by the 
												Applicant. It does not appear in 
												Article 145(4) of the 
												Constitution. Its use obfuscates 
												the analysis and establishes 
												nothing as a matter of law.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In our opinion, the operative 
												words are &quot;proceedings that were 
												commenced&quot; before the Judge 
												previous to his attainment of 
												the retiring age. In our 
												judgment, the word 
												&quot;proceedings,&quot; if it be a term 
												of art, encompasses any material 
												progress in the adjudicatory 
												process before the Judge or 
												Court. It may not be part-heard 
												in the sense of taking partial 
												testimony. If the Judge or Court 
												is seized of the matter and has 
												made rulings or determinations 
												or given directives, whether 
												these be interlocutory or not, 
												we would conclude that 
												proceedings have commenced 
												before that Judge or that Court 
												within the intendment of Article 
												145(4). That may not be 
												sufficient to constitute 
												&quot;proceedings&quot; in other aspects 
												of the law, depending on the 
												language that we are to construe 
												or apply. Under Article 145(4), 
												however, the word used is 
												&quot;proceedings&quot; commenced before a 
												Judge. The word is plain and 
												admits of no ambiguity. We will, 
												therefore, not embark upon any 
												exhaustive enquiry to ascertain 
												its meaning.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In Speedline Stevedoring Co., 
												Ltd. v. S. M. Kotei and Another, 
												the Exhibit &quot;A,&quot; tendered by the 
												Applicant, convinces us that the 
												Judge, Mr Justice Afreh, was 
												seized of the matter and the 
												proceedings had commenced before 
												him prior to March 27, 2003, 
												when he took evidence from the 
												first witness. For instance, on 
												14th March, 2003, Mr Justice 
												Afreh had made an order for 
												discoveries. He listened to and 
												dismissed a preliminary 
												objection by one of the parties, 
												for which he gave reasons later. 
												Other matters were dealt with. 
												Our impression, which may be 
												wrong, is that it was Counsel 
												for the Applicant whose conduct 
												contributed in no small measure 
												in the delay in taking evidence. 
												As appears from the Applicant's 
												Exhibit &quot;A,&quot; his Counsel did not 
												seem to have even an address for 
												the service of process which was 
												returned when sent to a Hotel. 
												Whether or not these antics were 
												intended to slow down the 
												proceedings, in anticipation of 
												the retirement of Mr Justice 
												Afreh, it certainly did have at 
												least that partial result. It 
												seems to us that in the 
												circumstances the strictures 
												against the progress of the case 
												are not in the best taste.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												After the motion had been filed, 
												the Applicant sought leave to 
												amend by asking for an Order of 
												Certiorari to quash the 
												proceedings of 5th May, 2003, of 
												the said Fast Track High Court 
												presided over by Mr Justice 
												Afreh. The Applicant refers us 
												to Article 130(2) of the 
												Constitution to buttress his 
												claim. By virtue of Article 132 
												of the Constitution read in 
												conjunction with Article 161, 
												the Supreme Court has the 
												supervisory jurisdiction to 
												quash the proceedings of the 
												High Court, which includes the 
												Fast Track Court. The gravamen 
												of the claim, as we understand 
												it, is that, once the issue of 
												competence and jurisdiction of 
												the Fast Track High Court was 
												pending at the Supreme Court, 
												the Fast Track High Court, in 
												obedience to the mandate of 
												Article 130(2) is obliged to 
												&quot;stay the proceedings.&quot; Having 
												not stayed the proceedings, the 
												Fast Track High Court, as the 
												argument presumably goes, was 
												acting without or in excess of 
												jurisdiction. That would be a 
												basis for jurisdiction in the 
												Supreme court to quash the 
												proceedings in the Fast Track 
												High Court of 5th May, 2003, 
												since prior to that date the 
												Applicant had filed a Motion in 
												the Supreme Court. That is a 
												misconception based upon a 
												misreading of Article 130(2) of 
												the Constitution. The Article 
												only provides that where a Court 
												other than the supreme Court is 
												confronted by a genuine issue of 
												&quot;matters relating to the 
												enforcement and interpretation 
												of this Constitution ... that 
												court shall stay the proceedings 
												and refer the question of law 
												involved to the Supreme Court 
												for Determination. &quot;That is not 
												the factual, legal or procedural 
												situation presented by this 
												case. The Fast Track High Court 
												did not consider that a question 
												of enforcement or interpretation 
												arose which had to be determined 
												by the Supreme Court. The 
												presiding Judge was apparently 
												prepared to proceed with the 
												case, and a dissatisfied party 
												would have a right to appeal in 
												respect of that issue. 
												Therefore, the Fast Track Court 
												did not refer the question to 
												the Supreme Court. It was the 
												Applicant who invoked the 
												jurisdiction of the Supreme 
												Court by way of Motion to 
												interpret the relevant 
												provisions of the Constitution. 
												That being the case, the Fast 
												Track High Court is not 
												obligated by the constitutional 
												provision in Article 130(2) to 
												stay its proceedings. A Motion 
												for other relief, in this case 
												an order of prohibition, does 
												not automatically operate to 
												stay proceedings in the Court 
												whose proceedings are being 
												challenged. It is only when the 
												trial Court refers the question 
												of law to the Supreme Court that 
												the Constitution enjoins it to 
												stay its proceedings until the 
												matter is determined by the 
												Supreme Court. A Motion for an 
												order of prohibition does not 
												come within the ambit of Article 
												130(2), and the Fast Track High 
												Court is perfectly within the 
												law to continue with its 
												proceedings until and unless 
												there is an order from a higher 
												court. That being our view, we 
												consider that the application 
												for certiorari to quash the 
												proceedings of the 5th May, 
												2003, in the Fast Track High 
												Court is wholly misconceived. 
												The amendment ought not to have 
												been brought. Article 130(2) 
												under which the Applicant 
												purports to invoke our 
												jurisdiction is clear and does 
												not require much effort to 
												understand. It does not relate 
												to the present case. We would 
												dismiss the amended claim also 
												as being without any merit.</span></p>
