												This is an appeal against the 
												unanimous judgment of the Court 
												of Appeal dated 14th December, 
												2000 affirming an award made by 
												the trial High Court at Kumasi 
												on 22nd January, 1999. This High 
												Court Judge made the award 
												pursuant to his own previous 
												order for the valuation and 
												sharing of the assets and 
												liabilities of a school owned 
												jointly by the parties. The 
												appellant contends that the 
												properties of the school had not 
												been &#8220;professionally or 
												otherwise valued&#8221; before the 
												award was made by the High Court 
												and that the Court of Appeal was 
												wrong in affirming the said 
												award.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The dispute between the parties 
												was primarily about the 
												ownership of a school 
												established in Kwadaso, Kumasi, 
												in the Ashanti Region and called 
												the Minnesota International 
												School. It was originally 
												established by four men in 1982. 
												In 1984, two of the four 
												founders decided to quit, and 
												the parties herein were left to 
												run the school as joint owners. 
												The plaintiff in the suit is the 
												appellant before us and the 
												defendant is the respondent. I 
												shall hereafter refer to them as 
												Appellant and Respondent. They 
												were the two left behind to run 
												the school. They entered into a 
												partnership agreement and 
												registered the school in their 
												joint names as owners.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellant became the 
												Headmaster of the school, and 
												the Respondent took the office 
												of Financial/Administrative 
												manager, up to 1992.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Troubles started in about 1992 
												when, according to the 
												appellant, the respondent 
												refused to render accounts and 
												claimed to be the sole owner of 
												the school.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												When matters came to a head, the 
												appellant sued the respondent on 
												10th May, 1994 at the High Court 
												in Kumasi, claiming a 
												&#8220;declaration that the plaintiff 
												and the defendant jointly own&#8221; 
												the school.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial High Court Judge gave 
												judgment for the appellant and 
												held that the parties jointly 
												owned the school and that they 
												owned it &#8220;in equal shares based 
												on the capital contribution of 
												¢50,000.00 each&#8221; as provided in 
												the partnership agreement. 
												Exercising his discretion under 
												Order 63, rule 6 of the High 
												Court (Civil Procedure Rules, 
												the learned judge made the 
												following order:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Furthermore, I hold that the 
												assets and liabilities of the 
												parties were to be shared in 
												equal proportions.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												From the evidence above it is 
												quite clear to me that the 
												parties cannot continue to 
												operate as a partnership at will 
												and order that the partnership 
												be wound-up and the assets and 
												liabilities of the partnership 
												shared as provided for under 
												clause 8 of Exhibit I&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Exhibit I is the partnership 
												agreement. In order to ensure a 
												fair sharing of the and 
												liabilities the learned High 
												Court judge further made an 
												order that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The parties are to appoint 
												competent experts to evaluate 
												the assets and liabilities and 
												same be distributed to the 
												parties in equal shares under 
												the supervision of the court&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There is no evidence in the 
												record of proceedings that any 
												valuation of the &quot;assets and 
												liabilities&quot; of the school was 
												ever made by &quot;competent experts&quot; 
												appointed by the parties as 
												envisaged by the court's order.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A valuation properly so-called 
												demands of the valuer to find 
												out the reasonable value of the 
												tangible assets involved in the 
												exercise. There must be clear 
												evidence that each property was 
												valued at a price which it would 
												have fetched at the time of the 
												valuation on a sale in the open 
												market between a notional buyer 
												and a notional seller; the open 
												market in the present case may 
												be confined to Kumasi or the 
												Ashanti Region since the 
												properties are in Kumasi. In a 
												case like the one before us 
												where a valuation is needed for 
												the particular purpose of having 
												the total value of the assets 
												shared equally between the 
												parties, I consider that any 
												valuation must be transparent 
												and prima facie fair.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the instant case, however, 
												there is absolutely no evidence 
												of a valuation. The school's 
												Accountants, Messrs M.A. Darko &amp; 
												Co. filed before the court on 
												29th September, 1998, what 
												purported to be financial 
												statements of the school, which 
												statements are clearly not 
												valuation reports. Prior to the 
												financial statements Nii 
												Quaye-Mensah &amp; Associates on 
												17th November, 1997 had also 
												filed what they themselves 
												labelled an &quot;Inventory&quot;. This 
												&quot;Inventory&quot; merely listed 
												certain properties allegedly 
												owned by the school and did not 
												place any value on them.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellant even took 
												objection to the &quot;Inventory&quot; for 
												reasons that (i) it did not 
												reflect the school's accounts, 
												(ii) it included the defendant's 
												own Peugeot Pick-up which was 
												not the property of the school 
												and (iii) that it did not 
												include text-books and science 
												equipments of the school. This 
												protest by the plaintiff was 
												contained in an affidavit filed 
												before the court on 18th 
												November, 1997.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Before the 20th of November, 
												1997, the Registrar-General had 
												been appointed as the Trustee 
												and official Liquidator. On 17th 
												November, 1997, one Mr. Joseph 
												Tamakloe, an officer of the 
												Registrar-General's Department, 
												acting on behalf, and on the 
												authority, of the 
												Registrar-General, swore to an 
												affidavit in which he deposed 
												that to the best of the 
												knowledge of the 
												Registrar-General &quot;the total 
												school fees for a term is about 
												¢28,000,000.00&quot; and that school 
												fees for the third term of the 
												1996/97 academic year and the 
												1st term of the 1997/98 academic 
												year had already been collected 
												by the teachers of the school. 
												It cannot be doubted that these 
												fees were collected by or at the 
												instance of the respondent.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On 20th November, 1997, the 
												Registrar-General was discharged 
												as the official Liquidator and 
												the Registrar of the court was 
												appointed to divide the assets 
												listed in the &quot;Inventory&quot; filed 
												by Messrs Nii Quaye-Mensah and 
												Associates to the parties in 
												equal shares. Both parties did 
												not permit this division to be 
												carried out. After some time, 
												respondent offered to &quot;pay the 
												appellant out completely in the 
												sum of ¢5,000,000.00 (Five 
												million cedis) cash&quot;. When this 
												offer reached the appellant he, 
												on the other hand, demanded to 
												be paid ¢287,475,352.50 as his 
												half share of the assets.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It was at this stage that the 
												High Court called the case on 
												22nd January, 1999 and ordered 
												that the appellant be paid 
												¢8,000,000.00 as his share. It 
												is clear that when on that 22nd 
												of January, 1999, the High Court 
												judge made the order he had no 
												valuation figure of the assets 
												to guide him, and the record 
												shows that he did not even 
												advert his mind to the valuation 
												he himself had ordered. I think 
												it would be fair to the parties 
												and the Learned High Court Judge 
												as well as the learned Justices 
												of the Court of Appeal to 
												reproduce what the learned High 
												Court judge said:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;By Court:&nbsp; After hearing given 
												the parties ample time to settle 
												the quantum of money payable to 
												the plaintiff an income due to 
												the School up to the date of the 
												judgment. It seems quite clear 
												that the movable items 
												inventoriesed have been 
												apportioned among the parties. 
												The bone of contention that is 
												entitled to ¢9,656,520.00 and a 
												further income of 
												¢256,713,832.50.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There is no evidence whatsoever 
												at the trial or from the audited 
												account in proof of this 
												monstrous demand. Since this 
												court is not a goldmine, I order 
												that the defendant pays the sum 
												of ¢8,000,000.00 to the 
												plaintiff forthwith&quot;. </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The learned High Court Judge 
												might have thought that he had 
												an unfettered power to award the 
												appellant any sum of money he 
												considered proper in the 
												circumstances. But he was 
												mistaken. He had no such power. 
												I would agree with counsel for 
												the appellant when he described 
												the award as &quot;capricious&quot; in the 
												sense that it was arbitrary and 
												unreliable as the actual half 
												share of the assets and 
												liabilities of the school. To 
												that extent the appeal must 
												succeed on ground one of the 
												appeal which is that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The Court of appeal erred when 
												it affirmed the decision of the 
												High Court without critically 
												examining the evidence contained 
												in the record of proceedings&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I myself cannot imagine how the 
												Court of Appeal came to the 
												conclusion that the High Court 
												&quot;took into account the realities 
												on the ground by awarding 
												¢8,000,000.00 as the appellant's 
												share of the assets ...&quot;&nbsp; I will 
												therefore allow the appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellant has urged this 
												court to set aside the award and 
												order a more equitable sharing 
												of the assets of the school 
												based on an effectual valuation. 
												The declared intention and 
												desire of the trial High Court 
												is that the properties be valued 
												by experts and the amount 
												determined be shared between the 
												parties &quot;in equal proportions&quot;. 
												Since no valuation had been 
												done, I think the appellant's 
												request is in order.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appeal is allowed. The

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

												The facts which gave rise to the 
												appeal are as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Plaintiff/Appellant and the 
												Defendant/Respondent, herein 
												after, shall be called the 
												Plaintiff and Defendant 
												respectively, with two other 
												persons, established a school on 
												Plot 15 Block B, Kwadaso, Kumasi 
												sometime in 1982. The land 
												belonged to the Defendant, who 
												already had built an out-house, 
												popularly or locally known in 
												Ghana, as Boys Quarters, on the 
												land. This was rented out to the 
												school and was used as offices, 
												while classes were conducted in 
												wooden structures constructed on 
												the vacant plot.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In 1984, the two other persons 
												who started the school with the 
												Plaintiff and Defendant in 1982, 
												left the school.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the same year, the Plaintiff 
												and Defendant entered into a 
												partnership agreement under Act 
												125 of 1962, to run the school 
												named the Minnesota 
												International School, as a 
												commercial venture. The school 
												was registered with the Ministry 
												of Education and the Ghana 
												Education Service. All the 
												relevant documents with regards 
												to the establishment and the 
												registration of the school were 
												signed by the Plaintiff and 
												Defendant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												For the next 8 years the 
												Plaintiff and the Defendant 
												jointly managed the school; 
												Plaintiff in the role as 
												headmaster, while the Defendant 
												managed the financial and 
												administrative side of the 
												school. As a commercial venture, 
												the income of the school in 1993 
												for the term was over ¢33 
												million.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In 1994, Plaintiff invited the 
												Defendant in his capacity as 
												financial and Administrative 
												Manager of the school, to render 
												accounts of the financial 
												position of the school.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Defendant refused and 
												claimed the school as sole 
												owner. Plaintiff was 
												consequently barred from 
												entering the school by the 
												Defendant from 20th&nbsp; June,1994.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Plaintiff therefore issued a 
												writ at the High Court Kumasi 
												for &quot;a Declaration that the 
												Plaintiff and the Defendant 
												jointly owned the Minnesota 
												International School, Kumasi&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

												JUDGMENT OF THE HIGH COURT</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This case has had a chequered 
												career at the High Court since 
												1994.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												First it came before Justice 
												P.K. Owusu Sekyere on the 11th 
												of July 1994, when he took the 
												summons for Directions and set 
												the case down for hearing on 
												7/12/94.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Thereafter there were series of 
												adjournments until 7/7/95 when 
												counsel for the Plaintiff asked 
												for an adjournment to enable the 
												parties settle the matter. The 
												case was then adjourned to 
												18/10/95.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There was no further hearing 
												till the 16th&nbsp; of January 1996 
												when it was called before a new 
												judge Justice ABADA. He 
												adjourned the case to 14/2/96 
												for hearing.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Finally on 8/3/96, hearing 
												commenced before the new judge 
												Justice ABADA. On the 2nd of 
												July 1996, the trial judge gave 
												judgment for the Plaintiff as 
												follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;In my judgment, the Plaintiff 
												has succeeded in establishing by 
												cogent prima facie evidence, 
												that the parties agreed to form 
												a joint partnership and the 
												object of that partnership was 
												to establish the Minnesota 
												International School. I further 
												hold that the parties own the 
												school in equal shares, based on 
												the capital contributions of 
												¢50,000 each. Furtherance, I 
												hold that the assets and 
												liabilities of the parties are 
												to be shared in equal 
												proportions. From the evidence 
												above, it is quite clear to me 
												that the parties cannot continue 
												to operate as a partnership at 
												will and therefore in exercise 
												of the powers conferred on the 
												court, I order that the 
												partnership be wound up and the 
												assets and liabilities of the 
												partnership shared as provided 
												for under clause 8 of Exh. 1. 
												The parties are to appoint 
												competent experts to evaluate 
												the assets and liabilities and 
												same to be distributed to the 
												parties in equal shares under 
												the supervision of the court&quot;.</span></p>

												LIQUIDATION.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the 27th of August, 1997, the 
												Registrar of the High Court was 
												appointed an Official Trustee. 
												He was to appoint an official 
												liquidator to wind up the 
												partnership under section 47(5) 
												of Act 152.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Then on the 4th of December, 
												1996 the Registrar General was 
												appointed as a Trustee and&nbsp; 
												Official&nbsp; Liquidator, to wind up 
												the affairs of the Minnesota 
												International School.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the 24th of February 1997, 
												the Defendant filed a motion, to 
												compel the official liquidator 
												to expedite the liquidation of 
												the partnership. In his 
												affidavit in support the 
												Defendant averred that the 
												liquidator had abandoned his 
												duty of winding up the 
												Partnership and has constituted 
												himself into a self-appointed 
												proprietor, managing the school.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												But one CHRISS KUMASS of the 
												Registrar General's Department 
												in an affidavit dated 5/3/97 in 
												opposition to the application by 
												the Defendant, swore that it was 
												rather the Defendant who was 
												frustrating the liquidation of 
												the school, by failing to 
												furnish the official liquidator 
												with the proper accounts for the 
												period 1994, 1995 and 1996.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the 23rd May 1997, in the 
												absence of the official 
												liquidator and counsel for the 
												Plaintiff, the court granted the 
												Defendant's application for 
												expeditious liquidation and gave 
												the official liquidator 21 days 
												to complete the liquidation of 
												the school.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the 10th of Nov. 1997, one 
												Tamakloe of the Registrar 
												General's Department filed an 
												affidavit to which was attached 
												an Inventory of the properties 
												of the Minnesota International 
												School. The Inventory included 
												789 Desk Table and 938 classroom 
												chairs.&nbsp; The Inventory also 
												showed that the total fees 
												collected for the 3rd term of 
												the academic year 1996/97 was 
												¢28 million, while the fees for 
												the academic year 1997/98 had 
												been collected by the teachers.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the 18th of Nov. 1997, the 
												Plaintiff filed an affidavit 
												protesting against the inventory 
												filed on 17/11/97. He claimed 
												that the inventory did not 
												include the school text books, 
												the science equipments and the 
												population of the school.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Registrar of the High Court 
												Kumasi was mandated to divide 
												the assets of the school 
												according to the agreed terms of 
												50%-50% between the Plaintiff 
												and the Defendant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Again the Plaintiff protested in 
												another affidavit dated 6/1/98 
												that the inventory did not 
												include, the accounts of the 
												school from 1988 and all the 
												school fees collected at the 
												beginning of the school. 
												Plaintiff claimed that since the 
												school was owned jointly by him 
												and the Plaintiff, all assets 
												including all the school 
												accounts should be divided 
												between them.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												He filed another affidavit on 
												21/1/98 in which he averred that 
												the school fees and the 
												classrooms, particularly, 
												Primary and JSS should be 
												included in the inventory and 
												these should be valued, so he 
												could receive his share.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The parties could not agree on a 
												formula for the distribution of 
												the assets of the Partnership 
												and the matter was adjourned by 
												the court several times, from 
												January to September 1998.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the 22/9/98, the Defendant 
												filed an affidavit in which he 
												offered to buy off the Plaintiff 
												by paying him the sum of ¢5 
												million as a final settlement of 
												his share in the Minnesota 
												International School.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Plaintiff rejected this 
												offer by the Defendant and 
												insisted that the judgment of 
												the court be carried out.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Then on the 7th of Dec. 1998, 
												the Plaintiff also filed an 
												affidavit in which he set out 
												his conditions for the 
												settlement of the matter. These 
												included the following:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Confronted with this avalanche

												matter.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Consequently on 22/1/99, the

												APPEAL</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Plaintiff dissatisfied with

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Court of Appeal on

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Plaintiff dissatisfied with

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												1.&nbsp; That the Court of Appeal

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court of appeal erred

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												MATTERS FOR DETERMINATION</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Before I deal with the grounds 
												of appeal, let me look at the 
												judgment of the trial court and 
												the order which was made by the 
												trial judge. At P.70 line 25, 
												the trial judge said:-</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;From the evidence above, it is 
												quite clear to me that the 
												parties cannot continue to 
												operate as a partnership at will 
												and therefore in exercise of the 
												powers conferred on the court, I 
												order that the partnership be 
												wound up and the assets and 
												liabilities of the partnership 
												shared as provided under clause 
												8 of Exhibit 1.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												From this judgment it is clear, 
												unambiguous and unequivocal, 
												that the assets and liabilities 
												of the school are to be shared 
												in equal proportion between the 
												Plaintiff and Defendant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The question to be answered is 
												whether the award of ¢8 million 
												to the Plaintiff by the court 
												represent 50% share of the 
												assets of the Minnesota 
												International School.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												By this award however the trial 
												court had actually assessed the 
												value of the school to be worth 
												¢16 million.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												But the report on the Financial 
												Statement of the school for the 
												period ending 1994 to July 1996 
												prepared by one Eric Orlando, 
												the Accountant of the High Court 
												Kumasi, indicated that the 
												statements were not complete 
												because the officer did not have 
												access to all the relevant 
												documents he needed to prepared 
												the statements.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On p.121, the report read:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;However the documents provided 
												us by the official liquidator is 
												inadequate and most related to 
												period between 1985-1994. I.e. 
												does not fall within the period 
												in question. No class list to 
												assess the number of pupils in 
												the school and the amount paid 
												as school fees. The amount paid 
												as teachers salaries and other 
												expenses are also not known. 
												However balance sheets relating 
												to the period 1994 to June 1996 
												which were prepared by the Darko 
												&amp; Company Chartered Accountancy 
												firms in Kumasi which were used 
												to prepare the school, accounts 
												were shown to us for study. We 
												therefore attach copies of the 
												said accounts for your study and 
												advice, since the materials used 
												in preparing the said accounts 
												were not made available to us, 
												to enable us prepare our own 
												accounts as requested. In the 
												summary we cannot prepare any 
												meaningful Financial Statement 
												to show the true income and 
												expenditure position of the 
												school for the periods 1994, 
												1995 to July 1996 as requested&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the face of this honest 
												admission by the Accountant that 
												no meaningful financial 
												statement could be prepared to 
												show the true income and 
												expenditure position of the 
												school for period 1994, 1996 and 
												1996, it will be difficult, to 
												put it rather mildly, to resist 
												the argument of the Plaintiff 
												that the award of ¢8 million was 
												not based on any accepted proof 
												and therefore was not fair.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Plaintiff in his affidavit 
												dated 29/8/94, had stated that 
												the Defendant barricaded the 
												door; to his office in August 
												1994, thus preventing him from 
												working in the school as the 
												headmaster.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In response Defendant admitted 
												barricading the door but claimed 
												that he was justified in doing 
												so.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Plaintiff therefore claimed that 
												since he was barred from 
												entering the school in August 
												1994, he had not received any 
												salary or allowance up to the 
												end of 1996. This has not been 
												denied by the Defendant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Since the Plaintiff and 
												Defendant are joint owners of 
												the school, then Plaintiff is 
												legally entitled to his salary 
												and allowances from the period 
												he was barred from entering the 
												school up to 1996.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In awarding the sum of ¢8 
												million to the Plaintiff as a 
												final settlement of his share in 
												the school, did the court take 
												this factor in consideration?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There is no evidence on record 
												to indicate that the trial court 
												took this element into account 
												when making this award.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Court of Appeal said at 
												P.175 of the record, that the 
												trial court took into account 
												the realities an the ground by 
												awarding ¢8 million to the 
												Plaintiff as his share of the 
												assets of the partnership.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												These &quot;realities on the ground&quot; 
												were never defined, nor were we 
												told what element constituted 
												these realities on the ground.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The judgment of the trial court 
												made it abundantly clear that 
												the assets and liabilities of 
												the school were to be shared 
												equally between the Plaintiff 
												and the Defendant. There is 
												therefore no legitimacy for 
												using any other formula as a 
												basis for sharing the assets of 
												the school.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On P.31 of the record, the 
												Defendant stated on Exh. 'M' in 
												an information on Private 
												Schools that the number of 
												pupils on roll was 1042.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Plaintiff claimed in an 
												affidavit on 17/11/97 that the 
												school fees collected per term 
												was ¢28 million. Plaintiff 
												further claimed that Defendant 
												was still running the school 
												with the same pupils, because it 
												was not possible to divide the 
												pupils into two equal shares.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Since Plaintiff was entitled to 
												50% of the pupils, the court 
												ought to have taken this into 
												consideration in making the 
												award for ¢8 million. There is 
												no evidence that the court took 
												this factor into account in 
												making the award.</span></p>

												DISCRETIONARY POWERS</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel for the Defendant 
												submitted that the learned judge 
												was exercising his judicial 
												discretion when he awarded the 
												Plaintiff the sum of ¢8 million 
												as his half share of the school. 
												That being an exercise of 
												judicial discretion, this court 
												ought not to interfere with the 
												decision of the court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is a long settled principle 
												that discretionary powers must 
												be exercised fairly. In general 
												it implies a duty to be fair and 
												to observe the elementary rules 
												of natural justice for a limited 
												purpose in the exercise of the 
												functions that are not strictly 
												judicial but administrative.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is my considered opinion that 
												in the matter before this court, 
												the exercise of the trial 
												judge's discretion was an 
												administrative function which 
												could have been done by the 
												official liquidator if he had 
												been allowed to do his work.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A critical examination of the 
												record shows clearly that the 
												trial judge had not been fair in 
												the award of ¢8 million to the 
												Plaintiff as his share of the 
												assets of the school.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												First, the trial judge failed to 
												take into consideration the fact 
												that the Plaintiff was barred 
												from the school in August 1994 
												and therefore he did not receive 
												any salary or allowance from 
												that time up to the end of 1996. 
												Since the Plaintiff is a joint 
												owner of the school with the 
												Defendant, as the court itself 
												had found, he was entitled to 
												some of the proceeds of the 
												school from 1994 to 1996.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Secondly the total population of 
												the school, 1042 remained with 
												the Defendant even after the 
												winding up. The Plaintiff is 
												entitled to be paid something 
												for this. There is no evidence 
												that this was even remotely 
												considered in the award paid to 
												the Plaintiff.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Thirdly the Financial Statement 
												of the school could not be 
												prepared to reflect the true 
												income and expenditure position 
												of the school for 1994, 1995, 
												1996. That being the situation, 
												the trial judge was not in any 
												position to share the assets of 
												the school equally between the 
												Plaintiff and the Defendant. Any 
												exercise of discretion by the 
												judge in that respect was bound 
												to be arbitrary, capricious and 
												uninformed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Constitution under Article 
												296 states:&#8212;</span></p>

												in any other law discretionary 
												power is vested in any person or 
												authority.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">

												(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; The exercise of the

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is my considered opinion that 
												the award of ¢8 million to the 
												Plaintiff as his share of the

												was not fair and was not based 
												on any clear principles.</span></p>

												the exercise of his discretion

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;In a question of discretion, 
												authorities are not of much 
												value. No two cases are exactly 
												alike and even if they were, the 
												court cannot be bound by a 
												previous decision to exercise 
												its discretion in a particular 
												way, because that would be in 
												effect putting an end to the

												Simon L.C. said&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The law as to the reversal by a 
												Court of Appeal of an order made 
												by a judge below in the exercise 
												of his discretion is well 
												established and any difficulty 
												that arises is due only to the 
												application of well established 
												principles in an individual 
												case. The appellate tribunal is 
												not at liberty merely to 
												substitute its own exercised by 
												the judge. In other words 
												appellate authorities ought not 
												to reverse the order merely 
												because they would themselves 
												have exercised the original 
												discretion, had it attached to 
												them, in a different way. But if 
												the appellate tribunal reaches 
												the clear conclusion that there 
												has been a wrongful exercise of 
												discretion, in that no weight, 
												or no sufficient weight has been 
												given to relevant 
												considerations, such as those 
												urged before us, by the 
												appellant, then the reversal of 
												the order no appeal may be 
												justified&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is my considered opinion that 
												the trial judge did not only 
												misapprehend the evidence, but 
												failed to give critical 
												considerations to relevant 
												issues, in the exercise of his 
												discretion.</span></p>

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">

												things that:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;In an appeal against findings 
												of facts to a second appellate 
												court, like this court, where 
												the lower court had concurred in 
												the findings of the trial court, 
												especially in a dispute, the 
												subject matter of which is 
												peculiarly within the bosom of 
												the two lower courts or 
												tribunals, this court will not 
												interfere with the concurrent 
												findings of the lower courts, 
												unless it is well established 
												with absolute clearness that 
												some blunder or error resulting 
												in a miscarriage of justice is 
												apparent in the way in which the 
												lower courts dealt with the 
												facts&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This principle does not apply to 
												the present case before the 
												court, because the decision of 
												the trial court was not based on

												findings of act by the trial 
												court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The decision or judgment of the

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
