                                              OUR system of criminal justice, a 
                                              British colonial legacy, is 
                                              conceptually based on the general 
                                              principle of fairplay and fair 
                                              trial. With the understanding of 
                                              such basic requirements, the 
                                              system of criminal justice is 
                                              founded on the premise that law 
                                              must be certain, easily 
                                              ascertainable and accessible to 
                                              the body-politic.&nbsp; Hence an act or 
                                              omission which is not proscribed 
                                              by law shall not be punished as a 
                                              crime.1 For this reason to 
                                              safeguard the rights of the 
                                              citizenry and to ensure fair trial 
                                              and fairplay, both the Criminal 
                                              Code, 1960 (Act 29) and the 
                                              Criminal Procedure Code, 1960 (Act 
                                              30), apart from proscribing and 
                                              defining acts which would amount 
                                              to a criminal conduct, also 
                                              prescribe penalties incidental 
                                              thereto.</span></p>

                                              The Criminal Procedure Code, 1960, 
                                              for example, deals with charges or 
                                              indictments,2 the rule against 
                                              duplicity,3 double jeopardy,4 the 
                                              statement of particulars of 
                                              offence, defects in such 
                                              particulars and consequences 
                                              incidental thereto.5 All these 
                                              rules are provided as safeguards 
                                              for ensuring certainty, fairness 
                                              and lack of surprise in the trial 
                                              of criminal cases.&nbsp; For the same 
                                              purpose, the Criminal Code, 1960 
                                              classifies acts into various 
                                              categories with corresponding 
                                              penalties. In such classification 
                                              the legislature would seem to have 
                                              deliberately categorised offences 
                                              according to their nature, gravity 
                                              and similarity. Those crimes which 
                                              are so similar, interconnected and 
                                              interrelated that their 
                                              constituent elements or component 
                                              parts consist of one and the same 
                                              conduct are grouped together in 
                                              one class, so that offences of 
                                              lesser degrees of gravity are 
                                              included in a major one. A classic 
                                              example is provided under chapter 
                                              2 of the Criminal Code, 1960, 
                                              dealing with the offence of 
                                              criminal homicide and similar 
                                              offences.6</span></p>

                                              Thus where an accused person is

                                              aggravated offence, there is no

                                              when the aggravated offence is not

                                              aware of the lesser offence 
                                              because in preparing his defence

                                              considered.7 In consequence, both

                                              Hence in some systems of criminal 
                                              justice administration an accused 
                                              person could not be convicted for

                                              for a felony even though all the

                                              may be present in the charge of 
                                              felony and vice versa.&nbsp; This is 
                                              based on the fact that a felony 
                                              and a misdemeanour are different 
                                              things and that there can be a

                                              it is expressly provided for by 
                                              statute.9 It is however 
                                              permissible for a person to be 
                                              convicted for a less aggravated 
                                              felony or misdemeanour on an 
                                              indictment charging a felony or a 
                                              misdemeanour of greater 
                                              aggravation, provided that the 
                                              indictment or charge contains 
                                              words apt to include both 
                                              offences.10 Thus criminal codes of 
                                              countries whose legal systems have 
                                              their origin in the common law, 
                                              sometimes provide expressly for

                                              misdemeanours, indictable and 
                                              non-indictable offences, but make 
                                              general provisions for conviction 
                                              in the alternative for lesser or

                                              the accused was charged could be 
                                              reduced to the lesser offence.&nbsp; It 
                                              was not the case that the offence 
                                              for which the accused was 
                                              convicted or had to be convicted 
                                              was less serious than the offence 
                                              charged; but that the offence 
                                              charged could be reduced to the 
                                              lesser one.19 Thus in the case of 
                                              a murder charge it has been held 
                                              that the courts had discretion to 
                                              convict the person of manslaughter 
                                              in the absence of a specific 
                                              provision in the Criminal Code 
                                              making it possible to convict him 
                                              of the lesser offence of 
                                              manslaughter.20 At least it has 
                                              been held by the West African 
                                              Court of Appeal in the case of R v

                                              Apart from criminal homicide and 
                                              related offences, the West African 
                                              Court of Appeal decided in the 
                                              case of R v Amos Kanu24 that an 
                                              accused person who was charged

                                              false accounting&quot;- a felony 
                                              punishable by seven years 
                                              imprisonment, could not be 
                                              convicted of the offence of false 
                                              accounting by public officer,&quot; a 
                                              misdemeanour punishable by 
                                              imprisonment of two years. The 
                                              reason for the decision was that 
                                              the aggravated offence could not 
                                              be reduced to the lesser offence.&nbsp; 
                                              Relying on the decision in R v 
                                              Kanu, the Supreme Court of Nigeria 
                                              held in R v Adokwu that upon a 
                                              charge of conspiracy to cause a 
                                              certain person to be charged with 
                                              the offence of unlawfully giving 
                                              an injection though knowing that 
                                              he was innocent contrary to 
                                              section 125 of the Nigerian 
                                              Criminal Code (which carries 
                                              imprisonment for seven years or 
                                              more), the accused person could 
                                              not be convicted of the lesser 
                                              offence of conspiracy to effect an 
                                              unlawful purpose under section 578 
                                              (6) of the Code. It would appear 
                                              from the above decisions that 
                                              before 1960, a trial court could 
                                              only invoke the provisions 
                                              enabling it to convict an accused 
                                              person of a lesser offence when 
                                              the lesser offence was embodied in 
                                              the aggravated offence and could 
                                              be reduced to the lesser one. If 
                                              this view is correct then it is 
                                              submitted that the lesser offence 
                                              must be one for which the trial 
                                              court is capable in law of 
                                              convicting the accused person.&nbsp; 
                                              Otherwise an appellate court 
                                              cannot apply the provision on 
                                              appeal.</span></p>

                                              prosecutor then invited the court

                                              the deceased, he was clearly 
                                              guilty of assault within the 
                                              meaning of section 84 of Act 29.&nbsp;

                                              be substituted for the one of 
                                              murder.&quot;</span></p>

                                              In the case of Moses Tsinowope, 
                                              the appellant was indicted for the 
                                              murder of one Amadu Tunde.&nbsp; The 
                                              facts of the case are that the 
                                              appellant was determined to 
                                              recover from the deceased person, 
                                              money which the deceased had taken 
                                              from the appellant's girl friend. 
                                              As the appellant was walking with 
                                              him towards his house for the 
                                              money, he stopped at a spot and 
                                              refused to go further. The 
                                              appellant held his shirt and tried 
                                              to drag him along and in the 
                                              process, the deceased slapped 
                                              him.&nbsp; The appellant retaliated 
                                              with a slap which felled the 
                                              deceased in a supine position. The 
                                              deceased was led away. The 
                                              deceased was later found in his 
                                              room lying on the ground in a coma 
                                              from which he eventually died. A 
                                              witness for the prosecution gave 
                                              evidence at the trial that shortly 
                                              before the appellant came and 
                                              confronted the deceased, three 
                                              girls had quarrelled and fought 
                                              with the deceased that same 
                                              evening.&nbsp; The pathologist who 
                                              performed the autopsy attributed 
                                              his death to massive subdural 
                                              haemorrhage which could have been 
                                              caused by injury such as a blow on 
                                              the head, a fall, a hit on the 
                                              head with a club or a hard 
                                              object.&nbsp; At the close of the case 
                                              for the prosecution the defence 
                                              made a submission of no case which 
                                              was overruled by the trial judge.&nbsp; 
                                              At the conclusion of the trial, 
                                              the jury returned a verdict of not 
                                              guilty of murder but guilty of 
                                              manslaughter. The rejection by the 
                                              court of the submission of no case 
                                              on behalf of the appellant was the 
                                              main grievance on the appeal.</span></p>

                                              In the light of the medical 
                                              evidence, the Court of Appeal 
                                              found that the offence of 
                                              manslaughter was not established 
                                              as the evidence did not show that 
                                              the slap of the accused resulted 
                                              in his death.&nbsp; The court held, 
                                              therefore, that the trial judge 
                                              erred in putting the appellant to 
                                              his defence on the charge of 
                                              murder.&nbsp; The court went on to hold 
                                              further that the error of the 
                                              trial judge in putting the 
                                              appellant to his defence on the 
                                              charge of murder did not 
                                              necessarily occasion any 
                                              miscarriage of justice in view of 
                                              section 154 (2) of the Criminal 
                                              Procedure Code, 1960 (Act 30).&nbsp; 
                                              The Court of Appeal then proceeded 
                                              to convict the appellant of 
                                              assault on the grounds that if the 
                                              learned trial judge had directed

                                              there was no doubt that the jury 
                                              would have returned a verdict of 
                                              guilty of assault.</span></p>

                                              sections 154 and 271 of Act 30 by

                                              inferentially, disentitled a judge

                                              the jury if he was of the opinion

                                              lesser offence other than the one 
                                              charged, notwithstanding the fact 
                                              that the trial court has no

                                              offence upon the indictment or the 
                                              charge laid before it.</span></p>

                                              The appellate jurisdiction of the 
                                              Court of Appeal in criminal 
                                              matters is limited to appeals from 
                                              decisions of a circuit court in 
                                              cases tried on indictment and 
                                              appeals from judgments, decrees or 
                                              orders of the High Court.36 The 
                                              High Court has original 
                                              jurisdiction in almost all 
                                              criminal matters.37 In practice, 
                                              however, the High Court seldom 
                                              tries cases summarily because such 
                                              cases are rarely brought before 
                                              it. The original jurisdiction of 
                                              the court is therefore exercised 
                                              mainly in respect of the most

                                              indictment. It stands to reason 
                                              that most of the criminal cases 
                                              that come on appeal to the Court 
                                              of Appeal are indictable

                                              not guilty the judge must record a 
                                              judgment of acquittal while if he 
                                              is found guilty the judge must 
                                              pass sentence on him according to 
                                              law.&nbsp; The verdict is the province 
                                              of the jury and the judge has no 
                                              option in the matter.&nbsp; In trials 
                                              with assessors even though the 
                                              judge ultimately decides the 
                                              verdict he must consult the 
                                              assessors for their opinions after 
                                              the summing up.&nbsp; The Criminal 
                                              Procedure Code, 1960, does not 
                                              provide for the procedure to be 
                                              followed on a submission of no 
                                              case, but it can be inferred that 
                                              it is the judge's duty to decide 
                                              on that submission and he can 
                                              uphold the submission, without 
                                              requesting for opinions from the 
                                              assessors.39 In that eventuality 
                                              the assessors will have to be 
                                              discharged if the accused is 
                                              acquitted. It follows from the 
                                              foregoing that after the verdict, 
                                              either on a submission of no case 
                                              or at the close of the case for 
                                              both sides, the Court of Appeal 
                                              can only substitute a verdict 
                                              which the court could have given 
                                              at either stages of the trial.</span></p>

                                              The decisions of the Court of 
                                              Appeal in Sarimbe alias Olala and 
                                              Moses Tsinowope presuppose that 
                                              the provisions of section 154 can 
                                              be invoked by a trial court, even 
                                              in a trial with a jury to convict 
                                              for a lesser offence 
                                              notwithstanding the jury's 
                                              responsibility for returning the 
                                              verdict on-the offence charged on

                                              Secondly, that when a jury returns 
                                              a verdict of not guilty in favour 
                                              of an accused person on a 
                                              submission of no case, the jury 
                                              will not be functus officio but 
                                              can proceed to consider a charge 
                                              of assault which could not be 
                                              lawfully tried on the indictment.&nbsp; 
                                              Should it be accepted upon the 
                                              basis of section 271 of Act 30 
                                              that upon a return of a verdict of

                                              with any indictable offence, then 
                                              the only reasonable interpretation 
                                              to be placed on the Court of 
                                              Appeal's decision in the case of 
                                              Moses Tsinowope will be that after 
                                              the trial judge had put the 
                                              accused to his defence, he would 
                                              have to continue the trial alone 
                                              without the jury.&nbsp; Such a result 
                                              will, it is submitted, be rather 
                                              preposterous as the accused cannot 
                                              be said to have had a fair trial 
                                              and an adequate opportunity to 
                                              prepare his defence.&nbsp; He would in 
                                              such a case have been tried on 
                                              indictment, up to the point when 
                                              his submission of no case is 
                                              upheld, and summarily for assault 
                                              when the jury would have become 
                                              functus officio.41 In view of the 
                                              fact that the jury cannot convict 
                                              of just any offence outside of the 
                                              indictment, a verdict of guilty of 
                                              assault by a jury will clearly be 
                                              ultra vires section 271.</span></p>

                                              The better and rational view would 
                                              appear to be that if after the 
                                              close of the case for the

                                              satisfied the requisite evidential 
                                              burden to warrant calling upon the

                                              manslaughter, the judge is 
                                              obliged, upon returning a verdict 
                                              of not guilty by the jury, to 
                                              acquit and discharge the accused 
                                              person of the charge on the 
                                              indictment. The judge is at 
                                              liberty to advise the prosecution 
                                              to consider charging the accused 
                                              person with the lesser but 
                                              different offence of which he has 
                                              not been charged and could not be 
                                              convicted of on the indictment but 
                                              of which some cogent evidence may 
                                              have been produced against him.&nbsp; 
                                              It should be pointed out that the 
                                              Criminal Procedure Code, 1960, 
                                              section 271 does not empower the 
                                              court to convict an accused person 
                                              of assault on an indictment for 
                                              murder. This means that where an 
                                              accused person is subsequently 
                                              tried and convicted on the lesser 
                                              offence of which he was not 
                                              originally charged, he cannot 
                                              plead &quot;autrefois acquit&quot; at his 
                                              trial.&nbsp; The basis for this 
                                              submission is that by the 
                                              definition of murder and 
                                              manslaughter under sections 47 and 
                                              51 of Act 29 respectively, before 
                                              a person can be convicted of 
                                              murder or manslaughter the 
                                              prosecution must prove that some 
                                              person has been unlawfully 
                                              killed.&nbsp; In the absence of 
                                              establishing that fact, it is 
                                              unnecessary, and in fact, 
                                              impossible for a trial court to 
                                              consider whether the person 
                                              alleged to have been killed was 
                                              killed by the accused under any of 
                                              the circumstances mentioned in 
                                              sections 47 and 51 of Act 29. Thus 
                                              in R v Nta 42 the appellant was 
                                              charged with murder and acquitted 
                                              on that charge.&nbsp; He was 
                                              subsequently charged and convicted 
                                              of the offence of committing an 
                                              act intended to cause grievous 
                                              bodily harm.&nbsp; Counsel for the 
                                              Crown submitted that on a charge 
                                              of murder the accused could have 
                                              been found guilty under section 58 
                                              of the Criminal Procedure Code of 
                                              Nigeria for committing an act 
                                              intended to cause grievous bodily 
                                              harm. Since that conduct formed 
                                              part of the charge of murder, and 
                                              as the appellant had been 
                                              acquitted on the charge of murder 
                                              and had not been convicted of an 
                                              act intended to cause grievous 
                                              bodily harm of which he stood in 
                                              jeopardy on the charge of murder, 
                                              he was entitled to rely on a plea 
                                              of &quot;autrefois acquit&quot; and that his 
                                              conviction was wrong. The West 
                                              African Court of Appeal held that 
                                              on a charge of murder the 
                                              provisions of the Criminal 
                                              Procedure Ordinance of Nigeria did 
                                              not enable the court to convict 
                                              the accused person of an act 
                                              intended to cause grievous bodily 
                                              harm. As the accused was not in 
                                              jeopardy on the lesser charge at 
                                              the first trial, he could not 
                                              plead &quot;autrefois acquit&quot; at the 
                                              trial.43 The court also held that 
                                              on a charge of murder an accused 
                                              person could not have been in 
                                              jeopardy of conviction for rescue, 
                                              nor for serious assault. In fact, 
                                              R v Nta is often referred to as an 
                                              authority for the proposition that 
                                              on a trial for murder a court 
                                              cannot convict of serious 
                                              assaults.</span></p>

                                              It is for good reasons that the 
                                              legislature classified homicide 
                                              offences under a particular PART 
                                              of the Act.&nbsp; Offences of causing 
                                              harm are classified under a 
                                              different PART and it would appear 
                                              that even when a person is charged 
                                              with murder and the prosecution 
                                              fails to prove murder or 
                                              manslaughter he cannot normally be 
                                              convicted of causing harm on the 
                                              same charge.&nbsp; For even though the 
                                              offence of murder embraces causing 
                                              harm, that offence cannot under 
                                              our law, be reduced to causing 
                                              harm because murder or homicide by 
                                              definition must involve the death 
                                              of a human being.&nbsp; When no death 
                                              occurs no offence of 
                                              homicide-murder or manslaughter 
                                              would have been committed. The 
                                              intention to kill is that which 
                                              makes the offence of murder more 
                                              serious than manslaughter and 
                                              hence reduces the former to the 
                                              latter when that intention is 
                                              lacking.&nbsp; It follows therefore 
                                              that without death which is the 
                                              central ingredient of criminal 
                                              homicide, no criminal homicide can 
                                              be reduced to another offence-not 
                                              even of causing harm.44</span></p>

                                              It is an accepted principle of law 
                                              that the legislature does not do 
                                              things in vain and the expression 
                                              of intent in section 52 of the 
                                              Criminal Code, 1960, shows clearly 
                                              that the legislature intended only 
                                              manslaughter to be a reduced 
                                              offence of murder.&nbsp; Even though 
                                              the provisions of section 154 of 
                                              Act 30 was enacted subsequent to 
                                              section 52 of Act 29 the 
                                              provisions of the earlier Act 
                                              being specific enactments, they 
                                              cannot be said to be affected by 
                                              the subsequent enactment of the 
                                              general provisions in section 154

                                              of the offence of murder has led 
                                              to the curtailment of the powers 
                                              of the jury to convict for other 
                                              lesser offences&nbsp; than that charged

                                              this explains why section 569 (2)

                                              It is our view that the 
                                              legislature did not intend to give 
                                              licence to Ghanaian trial courts 
                                              to convict for any lesser or

                                              could easily have catered for 
                                              that.&nbsp; Reading section 154 (1) and

                                              section 154 (2) is supposed to 
                                              complement section 154 (1) and to 
                                              avoid any ambiguity.&nbsp; It is in

                                              case of R v Adokwu as to the

                                              Nigeria seems to be relevant. The 
                                              learned judge in analysing the 
                                              effects of section 179 came to the 
                                              conclusion that:</span></p>

                                              be that there are other cases to 
                                              which it might apply but which

                                              It is trite law that a person 
                                              cannot ordinarily be convicted of 
                                              a different offence other than 
                                              that charged, because an accused 
                                              person must be told with certainty 
                                              of the offence he has committed to 
                                              enable him prepare his defence. 
                                              Thus normally, an accused person 
                                              who is charged with extortion 
                                              cannot be convicted of corruption 
                                              and vice versa; one charged with 
                                              stealing cannot be convicted of 
                                              fraud by false pretences and vice 
                                              versa; one charged with extortion 
                                              cannot be convicted of robbery and

                                              cannot be convicted of kindred 
                                              offences and vice versa, etc.&nbsp; 
                                              These offences, however, have so 
                                              much in common that multiplicity 
                                              of trials on the same facts, could 
                                              result.&nbsp; Legislatures, therefore, 
                                              sometimes make some definite 
                                              exceptions to the general rule to 
                                              enable some or all of these

                                              indictment charging one and not 
                                              the other or vice versa.&nbsp; Thus the 
                                              Ghanaian legislature devotes 
                                              sections 155 to 161 of the 
                                              Criminal Procedure Code, 1960 to 
                                              defining different offences which 
                                              ought to be dealt with on the same 
                                              charge or indictment. It is our 
                                              view that the legislative intent 
                                              was to conform to the general 
                                              principles of legality by giving 
                                              advance warning and ensuring 
                                              fairplay to enable conviction for 
                                              offences which ordinarily could 
                                              not be dealt with on the same 
                                              indictment. For instance, rape is 
                                              a first degree felony whilst 
                                              defilement of female under ten 
                                              years of age is a second degree 
                                              felony; defilement of female 
                                              between ten and fourteen years of 
                                              age is a misdemeanour but they can 
                                              be dealt with on an indictment 
                                              charging rape or defilement of 
                                              female under the age of ten.52</span></p>

                                              that one cannot escape the 
                                              conclusion that section 154 being 
                                              a general provision within the 
                                              context of specific provisions was 
                                              intended by the legislature to be 
                                              limited to offences that are 
                                              reducible to lesser offences 
                                              included in the aggravated ones 
                                              charged. It is in the light of 
                                              this that we think Mr Justice 
                                              Bairamian's analysis of section 
                                              179 of the Criminal Code of 
                                              Nigeria is correct and relevant in 
                                              considering section 154 of the 
                                              Criminal Procedure Code, 1960.&nbsp; 
                                              This is in accord with the 
                                              cardinal principle of our 
                                              Anglo-Ghanaian adversarial system 
                                              of adjudication that a trial 
                                              should be fair, and fairness 
                                              requires sufficient notice of the 
                                              offence alleged so that the 
                                              accused person may be able to 
                                              defend himself.</span></p>

                                              The Court of Appeal in the Moses 
                                              Tsinowope case appears to have 
                                              substituted a conviction of 
                                              assault for the jury's verdict of 
                                              manslaughter, ostensibly on the 
                                              basis that the jury had power to 
                                              have returned a verdict of guilty 
                                              of assault on the indictment 
                                              charged.&nbsp; This would appear to be 
                                              based on the powers of the Court 
                                              of Appeal, in special cases as 
                                              provided for in section 12 (2) of 
                                              the Courts Act, 1971,54 to reduce 
                                              the main charge to a lesser one. 
                                              Having demonstrated that the 
                                              application of sections 154 and 
                                              271 of Act 30 was palpably 
                                              misconceived, because after an 
                                              acquittal under section 271 the 
                                              jury will be functus officio, it 
                                              follows that there was no legal 
                                              basis for the court substituting 
                                              for manslaughter the conviction of 
                                              assault ostensibly under section 
                                              12 (2) of Act 372.&nbsp; This position, 
                                              it should be noted, appears to 
                                              contradict the decision of the 
                                              West African Court of Appeal in R 
                                              v Gyan where the court acting on

                                              for intentionally causing harm for 
                                              one of murder.&nbsp; It is nonetheless 
                                              our view that the court in R v 
                                              Gyan failed to consider the 
                                              specific issue of the scope and 
                                              effect of section 141 in its 
                                              context.&nbsp; If this was done the 
                                              court might have come to the 
                                              conclusion as it did in its 
                                              considered opinion in Awuah V R— 
                                              54a that section 141 did not apply 
                                              to appeals.</span></p>

                                              situations where a trial court may 
                                              exercise a discretion to convict 
                                              an accused person of a lesser

                                              empowers the High Court when it 
                                              considers that no substantial 
                                              miscarriage of justice had 
                                              actually occurred or that the 
                                              points raised consists of a 
                                              technicality or procedural error 
                                              or a defect in the charge but 
                                              there is evidence to support the 
                                              offence alleged in the charge or 
                                              any other offence of which the 
                                              accused could have been convicted 
                                              upon that charge, to dismiss the 
                                              appeal.&nbsp; In doing so the court can 
                                              alter the finding of the trial 
                                              court for the different offence 
                                              for which the accused could have 
                                              been convicted in the charge laid 
                                              in the statement of offence. 
                                              Notwithstanding this provision, it 
                                              is submitted on the authority of 
                                              Awuah v COP that even the High 
                                              Court cannot substitute a lesser 
                                              offence for an aggravated one 
                                              unless the lesser offence can be 
                                              reduced from the aggravated 
                                              offence and the trial court on the 
                                              facts proved could have convicted 
                                              the accused of the lesser 
                                              offence.&nbsp; Furthermore in altering 
                                              a conviction for a different 
                                              offence for which the accused 
                                              could have been tried, the legal 
                                              requirement of fair notice and 
                                              lack of surprise should have been 
                                              met by the substance of the 
                                              charge.61</span></p>

                                              In conclusion it must be 
                                              emphasised that the principle of 
                                              legality requires certainty in the 
                                              criminal law so as to enable the 
                                              citizenry order their lives 
                                              accordingly. It would be safe to 
                                              assume in principle, that in 
                                              responding to law society as a 
                                              whole takes into consideration the 
                                              interpretation which the courts 
                                              would place on statutory 
                                              provisions and order its life 
                                              accordingly.&nbsp; Where the conduct of 
                                              the courts in interpreting their 
                                              powers under a criminal statute is 
                                              consistent with a certain meaning 
                                              or consequences arising from a 
                                              breach of the statute the 
                                              citizenry is entitled to rely on 
                                              the consistent attitude of the 
                                              courts in ordering its affairs.&nbsp; 
                                              We support the American position 
                                              that the legal environment of a 
                                              statute as a means of 
                                              understanding legislation must 
                                              include public response to the 
                                              statute.61a Thus for over 
                                              twenty-five years, in murder 
                                              cases, the summing up and 
                                              direction by judges to the jury 
                                              have never included the

                                              of causing harm, assault or a

                                              The learned author of Criminal 
                                              Procedure in Ghana in a commentary 
                                              on the case of R v Noku states 
                                              that &quot;it is not clear what the

                                              because there is no authority 
                                              either way that on a charge of 
                                              murder the court may convict of 
                                              causing harm.&quot;&nbsp; He however 
                                              concludes that &quot;it would appear 
                                              that opinion favours the argument 
                                              that it is not open to the court 
                                              to convict of causing harm on a 
                                              charge of murder.&quot;62 This 
                                              conclusion was based on the 
                                              consistent trial of cases of 
                                              wounding leading to death.&nbsp; Be

                                              general principle and argument 
                                              contained in the commentary is

                                              that it ought to be accorded its

                                              some person has been unlawfully 
                                              killed. Until that fact has been 
                                              first established it is 
                                              unnecessary and in fact impossible 
                                              for the court to consider whether 
                                              the person alleged to have been 
                                              killed was killed by the accused 
                                              under any of the circumstances 
                                              mentioned in section 316 of the

                                              44. In R v Gyan (1954) 14 WACA 412 
                                              to which we have referred in note 
                                              22 (supra), the West African Court 
                                              of Appeal held that on a charge of 
                                              murder, an accused person could be 
                                              convicted of causing harm.&nbsp; This 
                                              decision is based on section 141 
                                              of the Criminal Procedure 
                                              Ordinance (Cap 10) of the Gold 
                                              Coast which allowed for conviction 
                                              for a &quot;minor offence&quot; of the 
                                              offence charged. Counsel for the 
                                              Crown invited the court to 
                                              substitute the conviction for that 
                                              of causing harm which the court 
                                              adhered to without assigning any 
                                              reasons for accepting counsel's 
                                              proposition and without 
                                              considering that section 141 might 
                                              not be applicable on appeal. It is 
                                              our view that in the light of the 
                                              wording of section 154 of Act 30 
                                              which is in pari materia with 
                                              section 179 of the Criminal 
                                              Procedure Act of Nigeria the 
                                              better view will be that an 
                                              accused person indicted for murder 
                                              cannot be convicted of causing 
                                              harm as causing harm does not 
                                              appear to be appropriate for trial 
                                              by jury or on indictment: see also 
                                              R v Noku (supra), note 43 and the 
                                              comments of Amissah, Criminal 
                                              Procedure in Ghana (1985 reprint) 
                                              at 167-168. However, on a charge 
                                              of attempted murder an accused can 
                                              be convicted of wounding if the 
                                              particulars of offence contain 
                                              words apt to include wounding. 
                                              This proposition is based on the 
                                              particular nature of the offence 
                                              of murder: see R v Nwaogugua

                                              Law Act, 1967, which introduced 
                                              radical changes in British 
                                              Criminal Law in this area is also 
                                              very explicit on the intention of 
                                              the legislature that the jury must 
                                              have wide powers. Section 6 (3) 
                                              states that: &quot;where, on a person's

                                              the jury find him not guilty of 
                                              the offence specifically charged 
                                              in the indictment, but the 
                                              allegations in the indictment 
                                              amount to or include (expressly or 
                                              by implication) an allegation of 
                                              another offence falling within the 
                                              jurisdiction of the court of 
                                              trial, the jury may find his 
                                              guilty of that other offence or of 
                                              an offence of which he could be 
                                              found guilty on the indictment 
                                              specifically charging that other 
                                              offence.&quot; It is important to note 
                                              that the Criminal Law Act, 1967, 
                                              ss 1 and 12 (5) and (6) have 
                                              abolished the distinction between 
                                              felony and misdemeanour including 
                                              the mode of trial attendant upon 
                                              that distinction.&nbsp; Almost all 
                                              trials are now on indictment by a 
                                              jury. See Archbold, Pleadings,

                                              offence&quot; within the context of the

                                              for lesser or included offences as
