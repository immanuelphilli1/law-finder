                                              continuing education of judges 
                                              programmes of 1987 were a seminar 
                                              held for circuit court judges from 
                                              24 to 27 February 1987 and an 
                                              induction course organised for 
                                              newly appointed magistrates 
                                              between 11 and 22 May 1987. The 
                                              majority of the talks and lectures 
                                              were given and delivered by some 
                                              of the most experienced judges and 
                                              legal practitioners. They dealt 
                                              principally with procedure and 
                                              interlocutory matters. Coming as 
                                              they did from the bosom of their 
                                              lordships themselves and the most 
                                              experienced legal practitioners, 
                                              those talks and lectures could 
                                              serve as useful guides to members 
                                              of the Bench themselves as well as 
                                              those of the Bar. The Review is

                                              On 31 December 1981, the PNDC upon 
                                              assumption of power suspended the 
                                              Constitution, 1979, and in its 
                                              place declared that it would rule 
                                              by Proclamation. Section 9 of the 
                                              said Proclamation provided that 
                                              notwithstanding the suspension of 
                                              the Constitution all courts in

                                              Delivery of judgment is in my view 
                                              the most important function of a 
                                              judge. The duty of an adjudicator, 
                                              be he magistrate, a circuit judge 
                                              or a High Court judge, is to hear 
                                              evidence, determine the issues 
                                              upon the evidence and finally 
                                              pronounce his decision or 
                                              judgment. The decision is binding 
                                              upon the parties and their privies 
                                              until a higher court overturns it. 
                                              People usually resort to the 
                                              courts because they want to affirm 
                                              or protect their rights, 
                                              properties and proprietory 
                                              interests. They come to court to 
                                              seek various forms of redress. The 
                                              parties at your level are only 
                                              interested in the justice of your 
                                              judgment. Very soon you will be 
                                              faced with greater responsibility 
                                              as proposals have been made for 
                                              the enhancement of your criminal 
                                              and civil jurisdictions. Whatever 
                                              be the nature of the action before 
                                              you, whether it be simple or 
                                              complicated, the parties are only

                                              the decision.</span></p>

                                              All our judgments are delivered in 
                                              English, unfortunately. I say 
                                              unfortunately, because it would 
                                              have been much easier to give 
                                              judgment in our own native 
                                              languages. However, the official 
                                              language of this country is 
                                              English and proceedings in court 
                                              are conducted in English. 
                                              Therefore our first duty is to 
                                              acquire reasonable command of the 
                                              English language. If a judge can 
                                              attain a higher standard of 
                                              English so much the better for his 
                                              judgment and advancement. It 
                                              should be the aim of every judge 
                                              to endeavour to acquire a very 
                                              high command of English.</span></p>

                                              makes reading of your judgments 
                                              interesting or dull. Each one of 
                                              us has his own style of writing,

                                              improve upon it, if need be. Style

                                              life “a modest dress, neat but not

                                              or Hastings. It is important that 
                                              whatever style you adopt, must

                                              intelligible and interesting. Some 
                                              judges like to be long-winded and 
                                              rambling in their judgments and 
                                              so, wrongly, think that by writing 
                                              pages and pages of judgment they 
                                              display their knowledge of the 
                                              law. If you can do so without 
                                              obfuscation, all well and good;

                                              There are a few cases where the 
                                              demeanour of witnesses may be 
                                              important and may be good guide 
                                              for preferring one piece of 
                                              evidence to the other resulting in 
                                              the judge believing one party and 
                                              disbelieving the other. Perhaps I 
                                              should mention that I have always 
                                              been sceptical of the process 
                                              whereby a judge uses demeanour as 
                                              a yardstick for his judgment. Some 
                                              witnesses may be so timid or 
                                              frightened by the atmosphere of 
                                              the court that their answers 
                                              appear incoherent and convey an 
                                              impression of telling lies, yet 
                                              they may be speaking the gospel 
                                              truth. Such witnesses when told 
                                              that they are liars become very 
                                              aggrieved by being ranked under 
                                              that nomenclature or as a prefix 
                                              to his name. Judges are not 
                                              omniscient, they are all liable to 
                                              the ordinary human frailties 
                                              including fallibility of man. 
                                              Therefore if a judge should find 
                                              it necessary to say of a witness 
                                              that he or she is a liar, the 
                                              judge must support his description 
                                              from the evidence before him. He 
                                              should not say under privilege of 
                                              immunity that which he dares not 
                                              say outside court premises.</span></p>

                                              Before a judge begins to hear 
                                              evidence he should get counsel to 
                                              settle the issues upon which he is

                                              determination. If the parties have 
                                              no counsel, the judge must himself 
                                              be clear what issues he is to 
                                              determine. Settling the issues

                                              unnecessary cross-examination.

                                              To illustrate the point that I am 
                                              driving at; the complainant in a 
                                              criminal case gave evidence for 
                                              the prosecution against his 
                                              steward boy who had been charged 
                                              with theft of his property. 
                                              Counsel’s first question without 
                                              laying any foundation whatsoever 
                                              in cross-examination was whether 
                                              or not a certain woman was not 
                                              complainant’s girl friend? 
                                              Naturally, the witness protested 
                                              and asked for the protection of 
                                              the court. Counsel insisted that 
                                              he was cross-examining and was 
                                              free to ask any question. 
                                              Throughout that cross-examination 
                                              there was not the slightest 
                                              attempt to link the lady with 
                                              theft. It was an attempt to 
                                              embarrass the gentleman in the 
                                              presence of his wife. Such 
                                              cross-examination is an abuse of 
                                              counsel’s privilege and the 
                                              processes of the court, and should 
                                              be discouraged. Cross-examination 
                                              should go to the matters in issue 
                                              and should not be an instrument of 
                                              oppression of a witness.</span></p>

                                              Having said all this there is 
                                              still the need for judges to 
                                              refresh their minds with the basic 
                                              law of the country. I have no 
                                              doubt that you are all aware of 
                                              the doctrine of stare decisis, 
                                              that is, a previous decision of 
                                              the superior courts on the point 
                                              is binding upon all inferior 
                                              courts. You know also that under 
                                              the Constitution and the PNDC 
                                              Proclamation the Supreme Court 
                                              decisions are binding on all 
                                              courts including the Court of 
                                              Appeal Decisions of the Court of 
                                              Appeal are binding on the High 
                                              Court and inferior courts and so 
                                              the chain of obeisance goes down 
                                              the steps of the hierarchy of 
                                              courts.</span></p>

                                              In applying law the court 
                                              sometimes may find that there are 
                                              two or more conflicting 
                                              authorities on the point before 
                                              it. If there is a conflict between 
                                              a decision of the Court of Appeal 
                                              and of the High Court, the Court 
                                              of Appeal decision should prevail. 
                                              If they are decisions of courts of 
                                              concurrent jurisdiction, the judge 
                                              must discuss them in his judgment 
                                              and decide which decision to adopt 
                                              giving reasons for his preference. 
                                              It is not for the court to decide 
                                              which point is correct. The court 
                                              should leave that for a higher 
                                              court to resolve. Having chosen 
                                              your preference on issue of law, 
                                              you then apply it to your findings 
                                              of facts. But there is the rub; 
                                              for if the application of the law 
                                              is wrong the bottom of the 
                                              decision falls apart unless a 
                                              higher court finds that upon 
                                              proper application of the law 
                                              court’s findings can be supported.</span></p>

                                              There are no laid down principles 
                                              for writing judgments. They must 
                                              bear the stamp of the judge. At 
                                              your level, however, I venture to 
                                              think you can learn a lot from 
                                              those who have travelled longer on 
                                              the same road as you are now in 
                                              the process of doing. In writing 
                                              judgment, the judge’s first duty 
                                              in his preface is to give a short 
                                              narrative of the parties, the 
                                              issue which has brought them to 
                                              court, and the statements of claim 
                                              and defence; but he must not 
                                              reproduce the whole statement of 
                                              plaintiff’s claim and statement of 
                                              the defence. This is most 
                                              unnecessary, because they are part 
                                              of the record. It is time 
                                              consuming and unnecessary wastage 
                                              of stationery.</span></p>

                                              The judge then must set out the 
                                              issues both of fact and law. There 
                                              may be ancillary issues, but if 
                                              they do not affect the 
                                              determination of the main issues, 
                                              they must be briefly disposed of. 
                                              The judge should concentrate on 
                                              the main issues and proceed to 
                                              attack the issues arising, firmly 
                                              making his own findings and 
                                              applying the law, and coming to a 
                                              conclusion one way or the other. 
                                              There can be no drawn match in a 
                                              court of law.</span></p>

                                              THE topic is dealing with the 
                                              process of the judicial system by 
                                              which it can be established 
                                              whether a criminal offence has 
                                              indeed been committed or not by a 
                                              person accused of committing it. 
                                              It is therefore necessary to know 
                                              what is involved in the concept of 
                                              crime and the legal means of 
                                              establishing it. A criminal case 
                                              in Ghana is essentially concerned 
                                              with the acts or omissions of 
                                              individuals in the state. These 
                                              acts or omissions are proscribed 
                                              by law and for that reason as

                                              the prescribed law to be punished 
                                              by death, imprisonment, fine1 or

                                              These proscribed acts or omissions 
                                              are in criminal jurisprudence 
                                              technically labelled as actus reus. 
                                              The fundamental principle in 
                                              criminal law is that as a general 
                                              proposition, without fault or 
                                              intention or in-advertence the 
                                              application of punishment 
                                              provisions and other measures are 
                                              considered inexpedient. Therefore 
                                              to establish a crime, unless a 
                                              statute specifically provides to 
                                              the contrary, the act or omission 
                                              must be established together with 
                                              the intention accompanying the 
                                              commission of the act. The said 
                                              intention -the mental element or 
                                              the knowledge of the wrongfulness 
                                              of the act is popularly known to 
                                              the students of the law as mens 
                                              rea. It is often said that the 
                                              mens rea and the actus reus must 
                                              coalesce before a crime can be 
                                              said to have been established and 
                                              this idea is institutionalised in 
                                              the latin aphorism actus non facit 
                                              reus, nisi mens sit rea, properly 
                                              translated this means &quot;an act does 
                                              not make a man guilty of a crime 
                                              unless his mind be also guilty.&quot; 
                                              It is thus not the actus which is 
                                              reus but the accused and his mind 
                                              respectively.2</span></p>

                                              In consequence of this concept of 
                                              crime, proof in a criminal case at 
                                              a trial is legally defined as the

                                              issue relevant to the statutory

                                              admissible evidence of a requisite

                                              The term tribunal of facts or the 
                                              court is used to highlight the 
                                              distinction between jury trials 
                                              and trials without a jury. For in 
                                              jury trials, the jury are the 
                                              tribunal of fact and where there

                                              determinable by the presiding

                                              legislation from the date when 
                                              statutory courts dispensing 
                                              criminal justice started to

                                              to deal with conduct specifically 
                                              defined as crime by the statutory 
                                              law of the country. The result is 
                                              that our courts are not bound by 
                                              the definition of any offence in a

                                              does not mean that our courts 
                                              should be cut off from the

                                              so and the principle here is

                                              This brings us to the second 
                                              matter, namely, facts in issue. 
                                              The facts in issue in a criminal 
                                              trial are all those facts which 
                                              the prosecutor, invariably the 
                                              Republic, must prove in order to 
                                              succeed together with any further 
                                              facts which the accused must prove 
                                              in order to establish a defence 
                                              which is open to him.7 In a 
                                              criminal trial there are generally 
                                              only three types of facts that 
                                              might emerge at various stages of 
                                              the proceedings. The first are the 
                                              facts which the prosecution might 
                                              give before the commencement of 
                                              the actual trial, indicating the 
                                              material they intend to prove by 
                                              admissible evidence.&nbsp; Secondly, 
                                              facts which the accused might, if 
                                              he is minded to do so, lead in his 
                                              evidence in his defence. Finally, 
                                              there are facts which on a 
                                              consideration of the respective 
                                              facts led in evidence by the 
                                              prosecution and the defence, the 
                                              presiding judge or magistrate 
                                              finds as representing in his 
                                              opinion the actual facts.8 If 
                                              these last category of facts tend 
                                              to establish the truth or 
                                              otherwise of the proscribed act 
                                              constituting the ingredients of 
                                              the offence as defined by statute, 
                                              then they are the facts in issue. 
                                              And the facts in issue in a 
                                              criminal trial as in all other 
                                              cases are only provable by 
                                              admissible evidence. The whole 
                                              question of proof therefore is in 
                                              all cases completely covered by 
                                              the law of evidence. What are all 
                                              these cases which the law of 
                                              evidence is designed to cater for?

                                              Generally speaking, there are 
                                              about four classes of cases where 
                                              the law of evidence is applicable. 
                                              These classes are criminal cases, 
                                              quasi-criminal cases, civil cases 
                                              and quasi-civil cases. 
                                              Quasi-criminal cases cover cases 
                                              like enquiries in connection with 
                                              misconduct of persons in public or 
                                              private organisations where the 
                                              result of the enquiry may end up 
                                              in the dismissal, suspension or 
                                              other punishment of a private 
                                              nature. Civil cases involve claims 
                                              by plaintiffs against defendants 
                                              for damages in respect of civil 
                                              wrongs or injury and directed at 
                                              settling the differences between 
                                              the parties by the payment of 
                                              damages or restoring the parties 
                                              to the position they would have 
                                              been in but for the civil wrong 
                                              done or the injury suffered. It 
                                              does not involve punishment. 
                                              Instances of quasi-civil cases are

                                              Theoretically, in the absence of 
                                              specific statutory provisions, 
                                              there are similarities between the 
                                              rules of evidence applicable in 
                                              establishing facts in all these 
                                              cases, but in practice there are 
                                              relevant differences depending on 
                                              the category of case involved.9 
                                              With regard to criminal trials 
                                              there are a number of provisions 
                                              largely made statutory by the 
                                              Evidence Decree, 1975 (NRCD 323) 
                                              which are peculiar to criminal 
                                              cases. For instance, as a general 
                                              proposition, barring statutory 
                                              exceptions, the rules of evidence 
                                              cannot be waived by the agreement 
                                              of the prosecutor and the accused. 
                                              Again the standard of proof is 
                                              higher than in civil and a great 
                                              number of other cases.10 There are 
                                              also special rules governing the 
                                              admissibility of complaints,11 the 
                                              reception of unsworn evidence, the

                                              the accused, and there are special

                                              The whole purpose of these special 
                                              and peculiar rules in the criminal 
                                              justice system is to enable the 
                                              proof of the ingredients of a 
                                              crime to be attained at a very 
                                              high level of relevancy by very 
                                              superior species of judicial 
                                              evidence. Judicial evidence in 
                                              criminal trials consists of the 
                                              testimony of hearsay, documents, 
                                              things and facts which a court 
                                              will accept as evidence of facts 
                                              in issue in a given criminal case. 
                                              When the evidence is so acceptable 
                                              then it is often referred to as 
                                              admissible evidence. And it must 
                                              be evidence of such a nature as to 
                                              make the tribunal of facts to feel 
                                              sure that the ingredients of the 
                                              offence have been proved. This is 
                                              the requisite degree of belief in 
                                              the quality of the evidence 
                                              proffered in proof and it is now 
                                              statutorily described in the 
                                              Evidence Decree confirming the 
                                              traditional description as &quot;proof

                                              The effect of this rather very 
                                              high standard of proof is that if 
                                              inadmissible evidence is 
                                              improperly accepted and a 
                                              conviction has resulted therefrom, 
                                              an appellate court would uphold 
                                              the conviction only on being 
                                              satisfied that if the offending 
                                              evidence were excluded it would 
                                              not affect the conviction, and 
                                              there would be no substantial 
                                              miscarriage of justice.14 When 
                                              counsel objects to the reception 
                                              of evidence on the ground that it 
                                              is inadmissible, he should do so 
                                              at the time the evidence is 
                                              offered15 and the court must 
                                              record and rule on the objection16 
                                              and although the appellate court 
                                              has a discretionary power to allow 
                                              an objection not raised at the 
                                              trial to be raised on appeal, it 
                                              would only do so if it has good 
                                              reason to go upon, in the absence 
                                              of a good reason the objection 
                                              would not be entertained.17 
                                              Improper rejection of evidence is 
                                              subject to the same consideration 
                                              and where the rejection had 
                                              resulted in a grave miscarriage of 
                                              justice, the conviction would be 
                                              quashe18 and if the appellate 
                                              court is satisfied that owing to 
                                              exceptional circumstances, the 
                                              interests of justice require that 
                                              there should be a re-trial, the 
                                              court may order a re-trial upon 
                                              such terms as it may think fit.19</span></p>

                                              One essential feature of proof in 
                                              criminal trials is that it is 
                                              proof solemnly undertaken before a 
                                              tribunal of competent 
                                              jurisdiction. The preliminary or 
                                              committal proceedings before a 
                                              district court is held in a court 
                                              room which may not necessarily be 
                                              open to the public. This is no 
                                              doubt a precaution to ensure

                                              in case an accused person is 
                                              discharged for want of evidence to 
                                              warrant his committal for trial. 
                                              For this purpose, it is provided 
                                              that if the ends of justice will 
                                              be best served by so doing the 
                                              court in committal proceedings may 
                                              order that no person shall have 
                                              access to, or be or remain in the 
                                              room or place without the court's 
                                              express permission.20 This is 
                                              specially so, since in committal

                                              received. In summary trials, 
                                              however, the room or place at 
                                              which the magistrate or judge sits

                                              The essence of a criminal trial is 
                                              proof of facts by the production 
                                              of admissible evidence. The 
                                              fundamental principle governing 
                                              &quot;proof&quot; generally in a criminal 
                                              trial is that he who asserts a 
                                              fact has the initial obligation to 
                                              produce evidence in order to 
                                              establish a requisite degree of 
                                              belief concerning the fact he 
                                              asserts in the mind of the 
                                              tribunal of fact or the Court.22 
                                              This is known in the law of Ghana 
                                              as the burden of persuasion and it 
                                              is often referred to in the books 
                                              as the burden of proof 23 In 
                                              appropriate circumstances, the 
                                              said burden of persuasion may 
                                              require a party to raise a 
                                              reasonable doubt concerning the 
                                              existence or non-existence of a 
                                              fact or that he should establish 
                                              the existence or non-existence of 
                                              a fact by a preponderance of the 
                                              probabilities or standard of proof 
                                              beyond a reasonable doubt.24</span></p>

                                              The burden of producing evidence 
                                              therefore involves the obligation 
                                              of a party to introduce sufficient 
                                              evidence up to a standard of proof 
                                              so as to convince the tribunal of 
                                              fact or the court to avoid a 
                                              ruling against him on the issue.25 
                                              In a criminal trial the said 
                                              standard of proof or the burden of 
                                              producing evidence when it is on 
                                              the prosecution as to any fact 
                                              which is essential to guilt, 
                                              requires the prosecution to 
                                              produce sufficient evidence so 
                                              that on all the evidence adduced 
                                              at the trial a reasonable tribunal 
                                              of fact or court could find the 
                                              existence of the fact beyond a 
                                              reasonable doubt.26 In jury trials 
                                              the jury determines questions of 
                                              fact and in non-jury trials the 
                                              court, ie the presiding judge or 
                                              magistrate decides all questions 
                                              of fact.27 When once a tribunal of 
                                              fact has decided a question of 
                                              fact, then strictly speaking it is 
                                              not the province of an appellate 
                                              court to determine the sufficiency 
                                              of the evidence produced at the 
                                              trial in proof of the fact. The 
                                              duty of the appellate court would 
                                              then be confined to a 
                                              determination as to whether in 
                                              say, the case of a conviction, 
                                              there was any evidence in the 
                                              trial which could support the 
                                              conviction.28</span></p>

                                              issues then the court is bound to

                                              the court and a conviction will 
                                              not be interfered with.30 Material 
                                              issues therefore are necessarily

                                              In this respect, it must be 
                                              reiterated that it is the facts in 
                                              issue that must be proved by 
                                              admissible evidence and that 
                                              evidence of rumours of the 
                                              commission of a crime do not 
                                              constitute evidence of the 
                                              commission of the said crime and 
                                              consequently evidence of rumours 
                                              circulating in the country about 
                                              the complicity of an accused 
                                              person is no proof of his 
                                              complicity in any crime.35 By the 
                                              practice of the courts a plea of 
                                              guilty is not acceptable in a 
                                              murder case and this invariable 
                                              practice and convention has now 
                                              been made statutory. The statutory 
                                              procedure in guilty pleas in 
                                              murder cases is to enter a plea of 
                                              not guilty and to proceed to hear 
                                              evidence in the normal way. It 
                                              would seem that the principle is 
                                              applicable in all capital offences 
                                              carrying the death penalty and the 
                                              policy justification for this must 
                                              rest in the severity of the 
                                              sentences entailing as it does the 
                                              ultimate punishment known to the 
                                              law and implying that an injustice 
                                              committed by a wrong conviction 
                                              can never be rectified after the

                                              In proving the guilt of an accused 
                                              person, the traditional concept 
                                              institutionalised by the decision 
                                              of the House of Lords&nbsp; in the

                                              the defence of insanity and to 
                                              statutory exceptions, the burden 
                                              of proof resting on the 
                                              prosecution to prove the guilt of 
                                              the accused person beyond 
                                              reasonable doubt does not shift. 
                                              It appears however that the rule 
                                              is apparently not as stringent as 
                                              the statement would seem to imply 
                                              and in appropriate circumstances 
                                              the burden of persuading a

                                              guilty of a crime or wrong-doing 
                                              could shift.36 In a charge of 
                                              bigamy involving an accused person 
                                              already married under the Marriage 
                                              Ordinance who contracted a

                                              prosecution proved the celebration 
                                              of the first marriage. They then 
                                              proved the identity of the accused 
                                              as one of the spouses to the 
                                              Ordinance Marriage. The accused 
                                              then merely alleged that his first 
                                              marriage was, in fact, invalid, a

                                              witness is one eligible to testify 
                                              and therefore liable to be called 
                                              to give evidence, but a 
                                              compellable witness is one who is 
                                              not only qualified to be called as 
                                              a witness at a trial but is 
                                              obliged by law to testify. In the 
                                              circumstance a witness may thus be 
                                              competent without being 
                                              compellable.55 The principal 
                                              ground of incompetency is one due 
                                              to defect in intellect of the 
                                              proposed&nbsp; witness. For this reason 
                                              no witness is competent who is&nbsp; 
                                              incapacitated by tender age, 
                                              drunkenness or unsoundness of mind 
                                              from giving rational testimony. 
                                              The incapacity however is 
                                              predicated on the inherent want of 
                                              understanding and appreciation of 
                                              the testimony caused by the defect 
                                              in the reasoning faculty.56 
                                              Consequently, a lunatic is 
                                              competent during a lucid interval, 
                                              a drunken person on his return to 
                                              sobriety, and a child of tender 
                                              years if he understands the duty 
                                              to tell the truth. The position 
                                              therefore is that every person who 
                                              is capable of expressing himself 
                                              so as to be understood either 
                                              directly or through interpretation 
                                              by one who can understand and who 
                                              also understands the duty to tell 
                                              the truth is a competent 
                                              witness.57 Formerly the husband or 
                                              wife of an accused was generally 
                                              not competent to give evidence for 
                                              the prosecution without the 
                                              consent of the accused, but since 
                                              the coming into force of the 
                                              Evidence Decree, 1975 (NRCD 323) 
                                              all pre-existing laws and 
                                              statutory disqualifications for 
                                              witnesses have been abolished.59</span></p>

                                              The oath requirement is generally 
                                              a condition precedent for the 
                                              admissibility of the evidence of 
                                              witnesses, and so any statement 
                                              made by a witness without oath or 
                                              affirmation is not considered as 
                                              evidence in trials of criminal 
                                              cases.60 There are however very 
                                              important exceptions to this rule. 
                                              One such exception is that an 
                                              accused person in a&nbsp; criminal 
                                              trial may make a statement in his 
                                              own defence without first taking 
                                              an oath or making an affirmation 
                                              and without being subject to 
                                              examination of all the parties.61 
                                              Such a statement is admissible to 
                                              the same extent as if it had been 
                                              made under oath and affirmation 
                                              and subject to examination by all 
                                              parties entitled to 
                                              cross-examine.62 The fact that the 
                                              statement was given without oath 
                                              or affirmation or that there was 
                                              no possibility of 
                                              cross-examination, as for 
                                              instance, in case of statements 
                                              from the dock goes only to weight 
                                              and credibility of the statement 
                                              and may be subject to comments by 
                                              the court, the prosecution or the 
                                              defence.63 Secondly, a voluntary 
                                              confession statement of an accused 
                                              person which is not made on oath 
                                              is admissible in evidence as an 
                                              exception to the hearsay rule.64 
                                              Another exception applies by 
                                              practice to children of tender 
                                              years. In criminal proceedings the 
                                              unsworn evidence of such children 
                                              is admissible if the court is 
                                              satisfied that though they do not 
                                              understand the nature of an oath, 
                                              they are possessed of sufficient 
                                              intelligence to express themselves 
                                              so as to be understood and they 
                                              understand the duty to tell the 
                                              truth. Such evidence however needs 
                                              corroboration.65 Furthermore a 
                                              witness merely called to produce a 
                                              document need not be sworn.66 An 
                                              advocate when required merely to 
                                              explain a case in which he had 
                                              acted as counsel or to give 
                                              evidence of the terms of a 
                                              compromise between parties to 
                                              litigation in which he had acted 
                                              need not be sworn and it is 
                                              customary for him to speak from 
                                              his place at the bar.67 A judge 
                                              sitting at a trial and a member of 
                                              the jury in a criminal case are 
                                              incompetent to testify in the 
                                              trial68 but if a judge merely 
                                              appears to explain a case in which 
                                              he had presided, it would seem 
                                              that he need not be sworn.69 Of 
                                              course the judge can ask questions 
                                              of the witnesses, and by the 
                                              practice of our courts, it is 
                                              unthinkable for an objection to be 
                                              raised to his questions, but the 
                                              Evidence Decree in section 68 (4) 
                                              permits it now. Under normal 
                                              circumstances the prosecution 
                                              calls its witnesses to prove its 
                                              case and the defence if it chooses 
                                              or where by law an onus is cast on 
                                              it also leads evidence to rebut 
                                              the case made by the prosecution 
                                              or to discharge its onus. The 
                                              judge, however, is not a mere 
                                              umpire and has statutory 
                                              discretion at any stage of a 
                                              criminal trial to call any person 
                                              as a witness or re-call and 
                                              re-examine any person already 
                                              examined70 but this statutory 
                                              power of the judge to call a 
                                              witness suo motu at the close of 
                                              the prosecution's case must 
                                              according to case law be exercised 
                                              judicially to prevent injustice, 
                                              eg to clarify an obscure or 
                                              ambiguous point in the 
                                              prosecution's case.71 This is 
                                              particularly so where the judge 
                                              calls a witness after the defence 
                                              had closed its case. In such a

                                              has a discretion under statute to 
                                              call a witness not called by

                                              defence and without the consent of 
                                              either of them provided that in 
                                              his opinion that course was 
                                              necessary in the interest of 
                                              justice. Such a witness however, 
                                              it has been held, could not be 
                                              examined or cross-examined either 
                                              by the prosecution or the defence

                                              The judge at a criminal trial has

                                              over the mode and order of 
                                              interrogating witnesses and

                                              to impeach his credibility unless

                                              witness as hostile was said to 
                                              make his evidence in favour of the 
                                              party calling him to be

                                              abolished by section 81(1) of the 
                                              Evidence Decree, 1975 (NRCD 323). 
                                              Under that provision the 
                                              credibility of a witness or any 
                                              part of his testimony may be 
                                              attacked or supported by any party

                                              provision in the Decree that where 
                                              before he calls a witness a party 
                                              has reasonable grounds to believe 
                                              that he will want to attack the 
                                              credibility of the witness or any 
                                              part of his testimony, the party 
                                              shall out of the presence of the 
                                              witness notify the court and every 
                                              other party of his expectation, 
                                              except that if the witness is a 
                                              party, the witness need not be 
                                              notified.78 So obviously an 
                                              accused person need not be 
                                              notified by the prosecution that 
                                              they intend to impeach his 
                                              credibility. This question of 
                                              impeaching the credibility of 
                                              witnesses highlights a perennial 
                                              problem in relation to the 
                                              evidence of witnesses, as to how 
                                              the court is to treat a statement 
                                              or a witness previously made which 
                                              is conflicting or inconsistent 
                                              with his testimony in court. The 
                                              case law on the subject inherited 
                                              from English law in R v Harris79 
                                              would seem to be that once it is

                                              previous statement the contents of 
                                              which are shown to be inconsistent 
                                              with his evidence in court, the 
                                              effect of his testimony on oath is 
                                              said to be negligible. Akainyah

                                              The principle governing

                                              only liable to be rejected 
                                              according to the circumstance of

                                              of proving or disproving guilt is 
                                              the testimony of witnesses. 
                                              Without a witness or witnesses 
                                              therefore it is impossible to

                                              As is obvious from a consideration 
                                              of the structure of our Criminal 
                                              Procedure Code, 1960 (Act 30) and 
                                              the provisions of the Evidence 
                                              Decree, 1975 (NRCD 323), it is 
                                              oral testimony by witnesses and 
                                              not evidence by affidavit or 
                                              depositions which is central to 
                                              our criminal justice system. There 
                                              are two exceptions. The first is 
                                              admission by an accused person 
                                              even if it is contained in an 
                                              affidavit, provided it satisfies 
                                              the well-known requirements of

                                              second is a statutory provision 
                                              meticulously formulated in section

                                              is so important that its terms 
                                              deserve careful study. It is as

                                              Generally speaking, with few 
                                              exceptions, the jurisdiction of 
                                              our courts in criminal cases is 
                                              territorial and does not extend to 
                                              foreign countries unless a statute 
                                              specifically extends it.89 
                                              Furthermore our orders and court 
                                              processes are intra-territorial. A 
                                              judge in Ghana purporting to act 
                                              under section 124 of Act 30 can 
                                              therefore claim no power to order 
                                              a magistrate in a foreign country 
                                              to proceed to any place to take 
                                              evidence under section 124 of Act 
                                              30. It seems therefore that apart 
                                              from admissions of accused persons

                                              competent witnesses to establish

                                              this the prosecution must lead
