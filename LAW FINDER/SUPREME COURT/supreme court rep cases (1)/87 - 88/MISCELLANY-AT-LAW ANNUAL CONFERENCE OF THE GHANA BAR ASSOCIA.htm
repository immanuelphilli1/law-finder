                                              VARIOUS functions and events 
                                              involving the Ghana Bench and the 
                                              Bar occurred almost unnoticed by 
                                              the public during the year 1988. 
                                              The exception was the Annual 
                                              Conference of the Ghana Bar 
                                              Association held at 
                                              Sekondi-Takoradi on 4 October 
                                              1988. Public interest in the 
                                              \conference was aroused by the 
                                              controversial opening address 
                                              delivered by Mr Peter Ala Adjetey, 
                                              the National President of the 
                                              Ghana Bar Association. In his 
                                              speech, he referred to corruption 
                                              by few members of the Bench. This 
                                              aspect of his speech engendered 
                                              such controversy receiving wide 
                                              publicity in both the local and 
                                              the world press, including the BBC 
                                              that the Review deems it wise and 
                                              desirable to present in full the 
                                              text of the President’s speech. We 
                                              also have the pleasure to present 
                                              the full text of the speech made 
                                              by Mr Justice J N K Taylor, who 
                                              deputised for the Chief Justice, 
                                              Mr Justice E N P Sowah, on that 
                                              occasion. Also included in the

                                              The past year has been an 
                                              extremely busy and eventful year 
                                              and I intend as usual to set out 
                                              as briefly as I can some of the 
                                              things that the General Council of 
                                              the Bar has tried to achieve with 
                                              varying degrees of success during 
                                              the year under review. In the 
                                              first place, the national officers 
                                              of the Bar have tried during the 
                                              year to keep up with their 
                                              programme of visits to regional 
                                              Bars. We took the view, however, 
                                              that in view of the financial 
                                              burden necessarily imposed on 
                                              regional tours, it would be 
                                              desirable to leave it to regional 
                                              Bars to invite the national 
                                              officers to visit them in their 
                                              regions. I cannot say that this 
                                              policy has worked to our entire 
                                              satisfaction. Hardly any regional 
                                              branch has found it convenient to 
                                              invite the national officers to 
                                              visit it and those regional 
                                              branches that were visited by 
                                              members of the General Council or 
                                              by the national officers found 
                                              themselves receiving such members 
                                              only because programmes initiated 
                                              by the General Council has to be 
                                              implemented at the regional level. 
                                              In the light of this experience 
                                              the national officers may consider 
                                              drawing up their own programme of 
                                              regional tours which will be 
                                              financed almost entirely from the 
                                              coffers of the national 
                                              secretariat of the Bar. It is 
                                              important that the national 
                                              officers of the Bar should be in 
                                              constant touch with our members at 
                                              the regional and local levels so 
                                              that problems that arise at these 
                                              levels can be discussed and 
                                              attended to, so to speak, in situ. 
                                              The importance of regional tours 
                                              by the national officers, 
                                              therefore, cannot be too strongly 
                                              emphasised.</span></p>

                                              In accordance with our policy of 
                                              seeking to achieve results in all 
                                              our endeavours by consultation, 
                                              co-operation and conciliation, in 
                                              the course of the year, we have 
                                              held meetings with several 
                                              officers of government. As usual, 
                                              we have held very fruitful 
                                              discussions with the Chief Justice 
                                              on the administration of justice 
                                              in the country generally. The 
                                              administration of justice in this 
                                              country continues to be plagued by 
                                              the absence of a judicial council. 
                                              We had assumed that a functioning 
                                              judicial council would be in place 
                                              within a few months of the 1987 
                                              annual conference, but this was 
                                              not to be. The absence of a 
                                              functioning judicial council and 
                                              of security of tenure for judges 
                                              over the past couple of years has 
                                              done incalculable harm to, and 
                                              undermined, all efforts aimed at 
                                              strengthening the judiciary and 
                                              thereby enhancing the quality of 
                                              justice administered by our 
                                              courts. The reason for this is 
                                              obvious. Not many lawyers of 
                                              competence, ability and integrity 
                                              are willing to become members of 
                                              the judiciary when they are liable 
                                              to be dismissed at the whim of the 
                                              executive without being given an 
                                              opportunity of answering any 
                                              charges that may be made against 
                                              them.</span></p>

                                              The conditions of service of 
                                              judges in this country are simply 
                                              a disgrace. It is generally felt 
                                              that judges do not receive a 
                                              living wage and that their 
                                              salaries are inadequate to enable 
                                              them to live in dignity and to 
                                              maintain their families as they 
                                              should. This state of affairs is 
                                              calculated to undermine judicial 
                                              confidence and ultimately to 
                                              undermine the administration of 
                                              justice itself. A strong judicial 
                                              council able to fight for and 
                                              maintain the independence of the 
                                              judiciary and assure reasonably 
                                              tolerable conditions of service 
                                              for judges is an indispensable

                                              the rule of law in this country.</span></p>

                                              It grieves me to say that the Bar 
                                              continues to receive reports which 
                                              show that some judges and 
                                              magistrates are engaged in a 
                                              course of conduct calculated to 
                                              undermine the efforts of the Bar 
                                              to secure for the bench reasonably 
                                              comfortable conditions of service. 
                                              The behaviour of some judges both 
                                              on and off the bench falls far 
                                              below what is expected of them. It 
                                              has been said time and again that 
                                              a judge, like Caesar’s wife, 
                                              should be above suspicion. Reports 
                                              reaching us indicate that a small 
                                              minority of judges and 
                                              magistrates, in spite of all 
                                              appeals, continue to engage in 
                                              corrupt practices, even sometimes 
                                              descending so low as to bargain 
                                              over the amount they should 
                                              receive by way of bribe to give 
                                              judgment in the giver’s favour. It 
                                              is criminally disgraceful that 
                                              justice should be sold to the 
                                              highest bidder. We call upon such 
                                              judges and magistrates to put an 
                                              immediate end to their career of 
                                              corruption before draconian steps 
                                              are taken against them. The 
                                              judiciary and the legal profession 
                                              are self-disciplining 
                                              institutions. It was society that

                                              themselves. If this power of 
                                              self-disciplining is not properly

                                              exercising executive power, will 
                                              take away the right or power of 
                                              self-disciplining given to the

                                              The General Council also held

                                              were greatly heartened by the 
                                              discussions with the 
                                              Attorney-General. Unfortunately,

                                              honourable Attorney-General will 
                                              be much more successful with the 
                                              employment of his powers of 
                                              persuasion with his cabinet 
                                              colleagues so that what he, like

                                              justice in this country would find 
                                              expression in appropriate

                                              prisoners, the physical conditions 
                                              of the prisons in this country and 
                                              matters relating thereto. Anyone

                                              When, several years ago, in a 
                                              debate in the Parliament of Ghana, 
                                              the life of which was cut rudely 
                                              short by some members of our armed 
                                              forces, I tried to impress upon 
                                              the government of the day the 
                                              necessity to improve conditions in 
                                              our prisons; members of parliament 
                                              and especially members of the 
                                              government party, almost laughed 
                                              me to scorn. My words and 
                                              admonition, however, proved to be 
                                              prophetic, for within a few months 
                                              all of us heard on the radio that 
                                              parliament had been dissolved and 
                                              that all members of parliament and 
                                              all ministers and members of the 
                                              government were to report to the 
                                              nearest police station for their 
                                              own safety. Of course, we all know 
                                              what happened to them when they 
                                              reported at those police stations. 
                                              They found themselves in the very 
                                              prisons, the conditions of which I 
                                              had tried to get them to improve 
                                              to no avail and needless to say 
                                              they were not particularly amused 
                                              by the conditions in which some of 
                                              them had to live or exist for 
                                              several years.</span></p>

                                              generally to reduce the prison

                                              custodial sentences only where it 
                                              is absolutely necessary to do so. 
                                              This, of course, requires 
                                              co-operation of the Bench and all

                                              country to examine automatically

                                              those who are in prison or some

                                              minimum since these barriers were 
                                              more calculated to harass innocent 
                                              citizens than to prevent the 
                                              commission of serious crimes. We 
                                              also discussed the illegal

                                              revolutionary zeal within limits 
                                              and to prevent them from harassing 
                                              innocent citizens and using the 
                                              weapons freely made available to 
                                              them for the purpose of settling 
                                              private scores. We again also 
                                              raised the question of the 
                                              establishment of a national parole 
                                              board as well as other issues 
                                              which will be dealt with later in 
                                              this address.</span></p>

                                              In my address to the annual 
                                              conference held in Accra in 1987, 
                                              I indicated that substantial 
                                              progress had been made towards 
                                              making the publication of a house 
                                              magazine or journal for the Ghana 
                                              Bar Association a reality. At that 
                                              time I said that the date for the 
                                              publication of a Ghana Bar 
                                              Bulletin was a matter of weeks 
                                              rather than months. As it turned 
                                              out, I was wrong. There were more 
                                              problems to be surmounted than I 
                                              had imagined, not the least of 
                                              which was the problem of money. As 
                                              you know, the Ghana Bar 
                                              Association cannot boast much by 
                                              way of financial resources. Our 
                                              annual subscriptions are too low 
                                              and are paid, in any case, by only 
                                              some 25 to 30 per cent of our 
                                              membership in spite of the efforts 
                                              that we make to get members to pay 
                                              their subscriptions. The General 
                                              Council has decided that 
                                              subscriptions should be raised 
                                              substantially and this matter 
                                              would be brought before this 
                                              conference. Be that as it may, we 
                                              had serious problems in raising 
                                              the necessary capital to fund the 
                                              publication of the Ghana Bar 
                                              Bulletin. As you all know, we were 
                                              able eventually to overcome these 
                                              seemingly insurmountable 
                                              difficulties and on 16 May 1988, 
                                              at a ceremony at the British 
                                              Council Hall in Accra, which was 
                                              reasonably well-patronised, the 
                                              Ghana Bar Bulletin made its debut 
                                              in the arena of professional 
                                              publications in this country. We 
                                              still have&nbsp; some teething 
                                              problems, the most important of 
                                              which is the problem of 
                                              distribution, but we think that 
                                              these problems will in due course 
                                              be solved so that our house 
                                              magazine will be available the 
                                              length and breadth of this country 
                                              and world-wide. On this occasion 
                                              it is only proper for me to 
                                              congratulate and thank all those 
                                              whose efforts made the publication 
                                              of the Ghana Bar Bulletin a 
                                              reality. We are not yet out of the 
                                              woods and we ask all persons of 
                                              goodwill to support this 
                                              worthwhile publication in a 
                                              practical way. In a climate in 
                                              which we are effectively denied 
                                              access to the media except on 
                                              matters which are regarded 
                                              non-controversial, it is important 
                                              that an organisation such as ours 
                                              should maintain its own organ of 
                                              communication.</span></p>

                                              As you will recall, we had 
                                              expected that a seminar on civil 
                                              procedure and legal aid sponsored 
                                              by the International Bar 
                                              Association would be held in Accra 
                                              in June this year. We had expected 
                                              that this seminar would have been 
                                              followed by the 6th Biennial 
                                              Conference of the African Bar 
                                              Association also in Accra, in the 
                                              same month. Unfortunately, owing 
                                              to a number of factors, it was not 
                                              possible for either the seminar or 
                                              the 6th Biennial Conference of the 
                                              African Bar Association to come on 
                                              as planned. Following 
                                              consultations with the 
                                              International Bar Association and 
                                              some officers of the African Bar 
                                              Association and of its constituent 
                                              organisations, it has been decided 
                                              that the International Bar 
                                              Association seminar on civil 
                                              procedure and legal aid, will be 
                                              held in Accra probably at the 
                                              Kwame Nkrumah at Conference Centre 
                                              on 20 and 21 March 1989, followed 
                                              by the 6th Biennial Conference of 
                                              the African Bar Association 
                                              probably at the same venue in 
                                              Accra from 22 to 25 March 1989. It 
                                              is expected that the theme of the 
                                              6th Biennial Conference of the 
                                              African Bar Association will be

                                              both from and outside Africa is 
                                              being invited to address the 
                                              conference on various topics under 
                                              that general theme. The first

                                              Bar Association is largely 
                                              responsible, are almost ready and, 
                                              as soon as approval is given for 
                                              them, they will be made available

                                              the seminar and the conference can 
                                              start in earnest.</span></p>

                                              The situation with regard to human 
                                              rights in this country has 
                                              improved considerably since the

                                              1982 and 1383 but it still leaves 
                                              much to be desired. Probably one

                                              statute books, human rights 
                                              violations are likely to continue 
                                              without any chance of their being 
                                              effectively challenged. As things 
                                              stand now anyone in this country 
                                              is liable to be picked up at any 
                                              time of the day or night at the 
                                              behest of the executive or 
                                              agencies of the government and can 
                                              literally be kept in detention or 
                                              confinement in whatever conditions 
                                              the executive thinks fit without 
                                              being brought to court for trial 
                                              and without anybody being able 
                                              effectively to do anything about 
                                              it. Such a situation is inherently 
                                              subversive of human rights and 
                                              creates temptations for agencies 
                                              of the government to violate the 
                                              human rights of citizens.</span></p>

                                              The fact that human rights 
                                              violations may not be as common 
                                              now as they were before does not 
                                              derogate from the potential threat 
                                              to human rights of the existence 
                                              on our statute books of the two 
                                              laws I have mentioned and laws of 
                                              a similar hue. Specifically the 
                                              human rights of some of our 
                                              members have been violated in the 
                                              course of the year. Several of our 
                                              members have been summarily 
                                              arrested and detained without so 
                                              much an explanation for their 
                                              detention. One or two of them have 
                                              been released from such detention 
                                              but as long as a single person is 
                                              unfree the rest of us are unfree 
                                              and we cannot therefore say that 
                                              we are happy with the existing 
                                              situation.</span></p>

                                              At the 1987 annual conference, I 
                                              mentioned that the Ghana Bar 
                                              Association, believing that they 
                                              should not engage merely in 
                                              negative criticisms but offer 
                                              constructive advice, accepted an 
                                              invitation from the Board of 
                                              Public Tribunals to submit 
                                              suggestions to the Board on 
                                              measures aimed at enhancing the 
                                              administration of justice by the 
                                              public tribunals. This was in fact 
                                              done in June 1987 when the 
                                              Association submitted a memorandum 
                                              to the Board of Public Tribunals 
                                              on this matter. Up to now the 
                                              Board of Public Tribunals has not 
                                              communicated to the Association 
                                              what it intends to do with the 
                                              suggestions which it invited 
                                              itself from the Association and no 
                                              change appears to have taken place 
                                              in the manner in which public 
                                              tribunals are run and in their 
                                              jurisdiction.</span></p>

                                              It is unnecessary for me to go 
                                              through the exercise of setting 
                                              out again the reasons for our

                                              in their present form, It is 
                                              perhaps pertinent to recall that 
                                              at the Call Dinner held last year 
                                              the Attorney-General indicated 
                                              that the public tribunals system 
                                              would be reviewed to allow for 
                                              some forms of appeals to the 
                                              traditional courts. This promise 
                                              has not yet been honoured and we 
                                              call upon the Attorney-General to 
                                              make good his promise for which he 
                                              received thunderous applause at 
                                              the dinner, as early as possible. 
                                              We of the Ghana Bar Association 
                                              are concerned with ensuring that 
                                              there is one system of justice for 
                                              all people in this country, not 
                                              two as obtained at present: one in

                                              It is necessary that seven years 
                                              after the coup or the events that 
                                              brought the present government 
                                              into power, the system of public 
                                              tribunals should be dovetailed 
                                              into, or merged with the existing 
                                              traditional legal system. I 
                                              understand that in the Soviet 
                                              Union this process did not take 
                                              more than four or five years and 
                                              the USSR is a vast country, 
                                              several times the size of our own 
                                              country and with several times our 
                                              population. Instead of bringing 
                                              about this merger, however, we 
                                              understand that district tribunals 
                                              are also going to be established. 
                                              We can only protest against this 
                                              step. If we are asking for 
                                              investors to come into this 
                                              country, we must be aware of the 
                                              fact that all investors will be 
                                              concerned with the safety of their 
                                              investments and therefore 
                                              necessarily with the type of 
                                              justice that is administered by 
                                              our courts and the extent to which 
                                              our courts and the extent to which 
                                              our courts are free and

                                              recent television programme the 
                                              Acting Director of Prisons was 
                                              said to have expressed the view 
                                              that the introduction of corporal 
                                              punishment could ease 
                                              over-crowding in our prisons. The 
                                              People’s Daily Graphic has taken 
                                              up the matter and in two 
                                              editorials has advocated the 
                                              introduction of corporal 
                                              punishment. It is strange that in 
                                              this day and age, in a society 
                                              which professes to be civilised we 
                                              should be advocating the 
                                              introduction of barbaric and 
                                              degrading forms of punishment.</span></p>

                                              The naivety of the argument that 
                                              corporal punishment should be 
                                              meted out in our schools and by 
                                              parents on their children and by 
                                              implication that this could be 
                                              extended to adult members of the 
                                              population as a punishment for the 
                                              commission of offences is 
                                              self-evident. What this argument 
                                              does is to equate our adult 
                                              population with children.&nbsp; South 
                                              Africa is said to inflict corporal 
                                              punishment in adult black members 
                                              of the population but that is only 
                                              because the apartheid regime 
                                              regards all black people as 
                                              children fit to be flogged in the 
                                              same way as children are flogged 
                                              in schools for various types of 
                                              misdemeanour. To inflict corporal 
                                              punishment on an adult citizen is 
                                              to violate his human rights 
                                              because infliction of corporal 
                                              punishment involves the 
                                              application of cruel and degrading 
                                              punishment which is not permitted 
                                              under international human rights 
                                              treaties and other conventions. It 
                                              is perhaps not insignificant that 
                                              Ghana has not yet seen it fit to 
                                              ratify the African Charter on

                                              If our prisons are over-crowded, 
                                              surely the reasons for this are, 
                                              obvious. In the first place, most 
                                              of our prisons were built scores 
                                              of years ago for a population that 
                                              was about one-third what it is 
                                              now. It must only be expected that 
                                              they cannot accommodate the prison 
                                              population that would necessarily 
                                              be increased by the increase in 
                                              the general population of the 
                                              country all other things being 
                                              equal. In the second place, too 
                                              many custodial sentences are 
                                              imposed these days especially by 
                                              the public tribunals. The answer 
                                              to this is two-fold. In the long 
                                              run more prison accommodation must 
                                              be made available but as an 
                                              additional measure, resort to 
                                              custodial sentences should be had 
                                              more infrequently than hitherto. 
                                              It may be that crimes are on the 
                                              increase but if they are, the 
                                              reasons can be found in the 
                                              existing economic and social 
                                              conditions of our times. The 
                                              solution should be a social and 
                                              humanitarian rather than a 
                                              draconian one. Draconian measures 
                                              cannot solve any problems in the 
                                              long run. A call for the 
                                              introduction of corporal 
                                              punishment is a call for a march 
                                              into the dark past to which we all 
                                              hope we shall never return. It is, 
                                              in fact, a call to a form of 
                                              recidivism from which we must 
                                              recoil with horror. The Ghana Bar 
                                              Association calls upon the Ghana 
                                              Government to reject the 
                                              short-sighted calls made on it to 
                                              introduce corporal punishment as a 
                                              way of punishing adult members of 
                                              this country.</span></p>

                                              adjustment programme yet what we 
                                              would appreciate more would be 
                                              more assistance and that praises 
                                              alone were not enough. He is said

                                              that if we continue at the present 
                                              rate at which we are contracting 
                                              loans, we may find ourselves in a 
                                              position in which, in attempting

                                              indebtedness, we end up by 
                                              accumulating more debts and being

                                              of indebtedness which will persist 
                                              and fall upon the shoulders of our

                                              of debts. If there are legislative 
                                              or other obstacles to such a 
                                              process, surely such obstacles can 
                                              be removed if the will to do so

                                              We may now turn our attention for 
                                              a few minutes to the political 
                                              situation in this country. Last 
                                              year we had occasion to criticise, 
                                              not only the content of the 
                                              proposals for district level 
                                              elections in this country, but 
                                              also the basis of legitimacy of 
                                              the proposals themselves. We said, 
                                              and this must be repeated here, 
                                              that provisions or proposals for 
                                              government at the district level 
                                              form part of the constitutional 
                                              framework of any country and that 
                                              to implement such proposals before 
                                              a constitution has been 
                                              promulgated for the country, 
                                              amounts to putting the cart before 
                                              the horse and depriving the 
                                              exercise of any basis of political 
                                              legitimacy. We had occasion also 
                                              to criticise the large proportion 
                                              of nominations of members of the 
                                              district assemblies that the 
                                              proposals contained. It must not 
                                              be forgotten that nominations were 
                                              an odious feature of colonial rule 
                                              and it is amazing that after 30 
                                              years of independence we should be 
                                              harking back to colonial devices 
                                              for keeping the local population 
                                              in line. No one, of course, paid 
                                              any heed to our objections and we 
                                              have been told that the district 
                                              level elections will take place 
                                              sometime in November this year. 
                                              Voters’ registers have been 
                                              compiled on the basis of 
                                              qualifications which has not been 
                                              approved by the people either 
                                              through their elected 
                                              representatives in a constituent 
                                              assembly or in a referendum. It is 
                                              difficult to imagine what the 
                                              basis of legitimacy of these 
                                              proposals is and one can only say 
                                              that they amount to nothing short 
                                              of an imposition, however 
                                              benevolent, beneficent or 
                                              well-intentioned. In democratic 
                                              constitution-making, good 
                                              intentions alone are not enough.</span></p>

                                              The question that may well be 
                                              asked at this stage is, after the 
                                              district level elections what

                                              and at the centre. Whatever may

                                              district level government, we ask,

                                              representative committee to devise

                                              for this country. It is suggested

                                              itself is seriously engaged in the

                                              say that the people of this

                                              anything less than what the people

                                              difficult to see why it should 
                                              take a vest country like Nigeria 
                                              four years to do what it is taking 
                                              our country almost twice as long

                                              As I have said, this country has 
                                              been under military dictatorship 
                                              since 31 December 1981. Some may 
                                              say that it has been a benevolent 
                                              dictatorship; others may say that 
                                              it has been a repressive 
                                              dictatorship. There is room for 
                                              difference of opinion here. But 
                                              whatever it is, whether benevolent 
                                              or repressive, it is a 
                                              dictatorship. That is one of the 
                                              reasons why it is possible to have 
                                              laws like PNDCL 4 and PNDCL 91 on 
                                              our statute books.</span></p>

                                              During the period that this 
                                              Government has been in power, a 
                                              number of measures have been taken 
                                              which have resulted in a number of 
                                              Ghanaians going into exile for 
                                              political reasons. Some of such 
                                              persons have been convicted in 
                                              absentia and it has become 
                                              extremely hazardous for them to 
                                              return to this country. The Ghana 
                                              Bar Association is of the view 
                                              that the time has come, after 
                                              nearly seven years of ruling by 
                                              the PNDC, for the government to 
                                              declare a general amnesty for all 
                                              Ghanaians whether for those that 
                                              have gone into exile or not, so 
                                              that all may live in peace and 
                                              devote their energies towards the 
                                              re-building of our country. There 
                                              are some Ghanaians who have been 
                                              in exile for some nine years, 
                                              while others have been in exile 
                                              for some seven years. From all 
                                              indications, many of them are 
                                              suffering great deprivations in 
                                              their countries of asylum and it 
                                              does the country no good to have 
                                              so many of its able citizens 
                                              languishing in exile in foreign 
                                              lands. The Ghana Bar Association 
                                              calls upon the PNDC to demonstrate 
                                              political magnanimity and maturity 
                                              by permitting all such Ghanaians 
                                              to return to their native land.</span></p>

                                              against the ordinary laws of this

                                              totally different matter. Until

                                              possible under our law to try a 
                                              person for a serious criminal 
                                              offence in absentia. It is 
                                              strongly urged that our law should 
                                              be so modified that the conviction 
                                              of all persons sentenced in 
                                              absentia would automatically lapse

                                              so that they can be tried afresh

                                              have to show cause why their 
                                              convictions should not stand. We
