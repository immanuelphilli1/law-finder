                                              THE practitioner in Ghana leaves 
                                              the law school persuaded that 
                                              there are but two standards of 
                                              proof—proof beyond reasonable 
                                              doubt, said to apply in criminal 
                                              cases, and proof on a balance of 
                                              probabilities in civil suits. No 
                                              sooner does he start practice than 
                                              he is confronted with a third 
                                              which, he is told, applies to 
                                              actions for declaration of title 
                                              to land. It is this supposedly 
                                              third standard of proof that I 
                                              intend to examine in this paper. 
                                              But first, what do we mean by a 
                                              balance of probabilities or, as 
                                              the Evidence Decree, 1975 (NRCD 
                                              323) now calls it, a preponderance 
                                              of the probabilities? Section 12 
                                              (1) of the Decree defines it as 
                                              &quot;that degree of certainty of 
                                              belief in the mind of the tribunal 
                                              of fact or the court by which it 
                                              is convinced that the existence of 
                                              a fact is more probable than its 
                                              non-existence.&quot;</span></p>

                                              In land suits where the claim is 
                                              laid in trespass, the plaintiff is 
                                              required to prove one of two 
                                              things: either that he is the 
                                              owner of the land, or that prior 
                                              to the trespass complained of he 
                                              had exclusive, long and quiet 
                                              possession of it. Where the 
                                              plaintiff relies on title as the 
                                              basis of his action for trespass, 
                                              or sues for a declaration of his 
                                              title to the land, a higher 
                                              standard of proof is demanded from 
                                              him than that required for proof 
                                              of possession. What our courts 
                                              demand from him is, in fact, proof 
                                              beyond reasonable doubt, but this 
                                              is often couched in the form that 
                                              the plaintiff must rely on the 
                                              strength of his own case and not 
                                              on the weakness of his opponent's 
                                              case. It was not a mere slip of

                                              The pronouncement was a reaction

                                              same terms as Order 40, r 1,

                                              In Amodu Rufai the plaintiff 
                                              sought a declaration of title to 
                                              land being the property of one 
                                              Saogun, deceased. Although he 
                                              pleaded that the land was situated 
                                              at a place called Pakodo Ikorodu 
                                              he did not offer any evidence as

                                              how Saogun came by his portion. He 
                                              relied on three judgments which, 
                                              he said, affected the land, but 
                                              failed to show that the land in 
                                              dispute was within the lands 
                                              covered by those judgments. When

                                              In dismissing the appeal Webber CJ 
                                              said at page 97: &quot;This is a claim 
                                              for a declaration of title to land 
                                              and the onus of proving ownership 
                                              is on the plaintiff. The result 
                                              depends on the strength of the 
                                              plaintiff's and not on the 
                                              weakness of the defendant's case.&quot; 
                                              It seems that the reference to 
                                              &quot;the weakness of the defendant's 
                                              case&quot; was made because it had been 
                                              urged on appeal that the judgment 
                                              of the High Court dismissing the 
                                              claim was against the weight of 
                                              evidence, implying that if the

                                              In Kodilinye the plaintiff sought 
                                              a declaration of title to land in 
                                              Onitsha Province. The trial judge 
                                              found that there was little to 
                                              choose between the rival 
                                              traditional histories and that the 
                                              evidence on both sides was 
                                              &quot;conflicting and somewhat 
                                              confused&quot; and dismissed the 
                                              action. On appeal, the point was 
                                              taken that having regard to Order 
                                              39, r 1 the plaintiff ought to 
                                              have been non-suited. The answer 
                                              of Webber CJ, was that the rule 
                                              did not apply to actions for 
                                              declaration of title to land. He 
                                              said from pages 337-338:</span></p>

                                              &quot;I do not think that this rule 
                                              should be applied in this case 
                                              which seeks for a declaration of 
                                              title. The onus lies on the 
                                              plaintiff to satisfy the Court 
                                              that he is entitled on the 
                                              evidence brought by him to a 
                                              declaration of title. The 
                                              plaintiff in this case must rely 
                                              on the strength of his own case 
                                              and not on the weakness of the 
                                              defendant's case. If this onus is 
                                              not discharged, the weakness of 
                                              the defendant's case will not help 
                                              him and the proper judgment is for 
                                              the defendant. Such a judgment 
                                              decrees no title to the defendant, 
                                              he not having sought the 
                                              declaration. So if the whole 
                                              evidence in the case be 
                                              conflicting and somewhat confused, 
                                              and there is little to choose 
                                              between the rival traditional 
                                              stories the plaintiff fails in the 
                                              decree he seeks, and judgment must

                                              rights. In the West African Court 
                                              of Appeal Mr Bossman, counsel for 
                                              the defendants argued that the 
                                              trial judge had misdirected 
                                              himself as to the real issue in 
                                              the case and that the question 
                                              which ought to have been asked 
                                              was, &quot;The burden of proving their 
                                              title to the land is upon 
                                              plaintiffs. Have they in fact 
                                              discharged it?&quot; and he submitted 
                                              that it was the rule enunciated by 
                                              Webber CJ in Kodilinye which was 
                                              applicable to the case before the 
                                              court, not the principles laid 
                                              down in Addo v Wusu. The court 
                                              consisting of Foster-Sutton P, 
                                              Coussey and Manyo-Plange JJ agreed 
                                              and allowed the appeal. In the 
                                              second case, one of three 
                                              communities which were in 
                                              occupation of an island sought, as 
                                              against the other two, a 
                                              declaration of their title to the 
                                              whole and failed. When on appeal, 
                                              it was urged that the judgment was 
                                              against the weight of evidence; 
                                              the court per Coussey JA answered

                                              There are at least three 
                                              qualifications to the rule in 
                                              Kodilinye v Odu. The first is 
                                              where the plaintiff leads 
                                              satisfactory evidence but the 
                                              court is disabled from granting 
                                              him relief because the boundaries 
                                              of the land in respect of which 
                                              the declaration is sought have not 
                                              been clearly ascertained. The 
                                              point arose in the Gold Coast case 
                                              of Kwadzo v Adjei (1944) 10 WACA 
                                              274, in which judgment was 
                                              delivered in Accra on 14 November 
                                              1944. The action had been

                                              Tribunal, had gone to the Avatime 
                                              State Council on appeal, and then 
                                              to the Provincial Commissioner's 
                                              court. The plaintiff had obtained 
                                              a declaration of title even though 
                                              the boundaries of the land had not 
                                              been ascertained with any degree 
                                              of accuracy. Allowing the appeal,

                                              CJJ, and Coussey J remitted the 
                                              case to the Provincial 
                                              Commissioner's court with a 
                                              direction that that court shall 
                                              re-hear the case entirely de novo 
                                              with the assistance of a plan 
                                              showing the land in dispute. 
                                              Another opportunity for a 
                                              departure from the rule came on 5 
                                              October 1954 when the court 
                                              delivered judgment in Lagos in the 
                                              Nigerian case of Amata v Modekwe 
                                              (1952) 14 WACA 580, where both the 
                                              plaintiffs and the respondents had 
                                              tendered in evidence plans which 
                                              the court found were inaccurate.

                                              Two cases may be cited to 
                                              illustrate this. In Abinah v 
                                              Kennedy [(1921) FC'20-'21, 211] a 
                                              house which originally belonged to 
                                              the family of the plaintiff was 
                                              sold by public auction in 
                                              execution of a judgment debt and 
                                              bought by one Niblett to whom a 
                                              certificate of purchase dated 1883 
                                              was issued. The certificate was so 
                                              vaguely worded that in the opinion 
                                              of the court it was valueless. 
                                              Somehow this certificate came into 
                                              the possession of the husband of 
                                              the defendant who had lived in the 
                                              house, effected repairs and 
                                              received rents for some 30 years 
                                              until his death. It was held on 
                                              these facts that Kennedy must have 
                                              bought the house from a person who 
                                              had a right to sell. In Aidoo v

                                              developed a plot on Jukwa stool 
                                              land. There was no trace of any 
                                              document of sale although it was 
                                              alleged that one had been signed. 
                                              Millers' successor, UAC Ltd, had

                                              sold the land to the plaintiff. In

                                              and obtained a declaration of

                                              possession before trespass, the

                                              advantage of weaknesses in the

                                              disputed land, and this fact

                                              upon this line, but the plaintiff 
                                              in the first instance called

                                              The third qualification arises 
                                              from the second and it is that

                                              occupation of the land, the proper

                                              better title. Two cases which 
                                              illustrate this are Eyo Ita v

                                              from a third party failed to prove 
                                              this, but the evidence showed that 
                                              it was acquired from the 
                                              defendants and had with their 
                                              knowledge and consent remained in 
                                              the possession of the plaintiff 
                                              for over 50 years without any 
                                              acknowledgement of right in the 
                                              defendants. The West African Court 
                                              of Appeal consisting of Kingdon 
                                              and Webber CJJ and Butler-Lloyd J

                                              grant to the plaintiff of a 
                                              declaration of title and 
                                              substituted a right of occupancy 
                                              in accordance with custom. In the 
                                              latter, the precise nature of the 
                                              plaintiffs' title to the land was 
                                              in doubt, but the evidence showed 
                                              that they were entitled to 
                                              exclusive and undisturbed 
                                              possession of the land. On appeal 
                                              a declaration of title in their 
                                              favour was set aside, but the 
                                              injunction restraining the 
                                              defendants from trespassing on the

                                              suits in our courts have, as

                                              of the land. Such a defendant need 
                                              not, and usually does not, seek

                                              on the strength of his own case, 
                                              that is, prove his title, and not 
                                              rely on the weakness of his 
                                              opponent's, that is, lack of title 
                                              in the defendant; so that if the 
                                              plaintiff fails to prove that he 
                                              is entitled to have a declaration 
                                              made of his title to the land, the 
                                              action ought to fail and the 
                                              defendant left in possession of 
                                              the land. In Kwamina Kuma v Kofi 
                                              Kuma (1934) 2 WACA 178, upon proof 
                                              that the ancestors of the 
                                              defendant had been in possession 
                                              of the land for six generations 
                                              without acknowledging the title of 
                                              the plaintiff, a declaration of 
                                              title in favour of the plaintiff 
                                              was set aside and a non-suit 
                                              entered. In Abakam Effiana Family 
                                              v Mbibado Effiana Family [1959] 
                                              GLR 362, CA, the plaintiff family 
                                              sought to prevent the defendant 
                                              family from re-building a house 
                                              which had fallen into ruins, 
                                              claiming that the land belonged to 
                                              them. Delivering the judgment of 
                                              the Court of Appeal, Van Lare JA

                                              &quot;On the plaintiff's own admission 
                                              it was established that the 
                                              defendants had been in long 
                                              undisturbed possession and 
                                              occupation of the land, including 
                                              that portion of the land on which 
                                              the controversial house had been 
                                              built, and were therefore entitled 
                                              to the full protection of the law 
                                              against anyone except a person who 
                                              could affirmatively prove a better 
                                              title. It is clear that the onus 
                                              upon the plaintiffs in this case 
                                              was heavy in the extreme.&quot;</span></p>

                                              The court accordingly restored the 
                                              decision of the trial native court 
                                              dismissing the action. And in 
                                              Azagba v Negov [1964] GLR 450, SC 
                                              where the plaintiffs claimed that 
                                              their ancestors had put the 
                                              ancestors of the defendants on the 
                                              land as caretakers some five 
                                              hundred years before the suit, the 
                                              action for a declaration of title 
                                              failed. Thus, the rule enunciated 
                                              by Webber CJ applies whenever the 
                                              defendant was in exclusive, long 
                                              and quiet possession of the land 
                                              before the suit. Where he was not, 
                                              the case falls to be determined on 
                                              a balance of probabilities, by 
                                              which test the plaintiff's 
                                              possession, if of long duration, 
                                              may prove decisive; for even where 
                                              a plaintiff in possession fails to 
                                              satisfy the court that he is the 
                                              owner of the land he may be 
                                              granted the right of occupancy 
                                              according to custom if he proves 
                                              his entitlement to same.</span></p>
