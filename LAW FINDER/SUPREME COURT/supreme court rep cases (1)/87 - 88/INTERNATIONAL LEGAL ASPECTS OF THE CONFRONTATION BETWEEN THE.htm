                                              ON 27 June 1986, the International 
                                              Court of Justice at The Hague 
                                              delivered an important judgment in 
                                              the Case Concerning Military and 
                                              Paramilitary Activities in and 
                                              against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. 
                                              United States of America).1 This 
                                              decision on the merits of the case 
                                              followed earlier proceedings in 
                                              which the ICJ held that it had 
                                              jurisdiction to hear the 
                                              complaints filed by Nicaragua in 
                                              its application against the United 
                                              States of America and that the 
                                              same were admissible before it.2 
                                              The court's decision at the 
                                              jurisdiction and admissibility 
                                              phase of the proceedings provoked 
                                              the withdrawal of the USA from 
                                              further participation in the case, 
                                              explaining that the court's 
                                              decision was contrary to both law 
                                              and fact.3 This paper examines the 
                                              relationship between the Republic 
                                              of South Africa and the 
                                              neighbouring independent African 
                                              States who since the declaration 
                                              of UDI by the Ian Smith regime in 
                                              Rhodesia, have been recognised by 
                                              the OAU, the UN and other 
                                              international organisations as 
                                              constituting the core frontline of 
                                              states confronting South Africa.4 
                                              By the nature of things, the 
                                              relationship has been 
                                              characterised by South Africa’s 
                                              acts of violence and use of 
                                              coercion combined with the 
                                              adoption of economic policies 
                                              aimed at consolidating existing 
                                              bonds of economic dependence of 
                                              the Frontline States. In certain 
                                              instances, South Africa has 
                                              resorted to direct use of force 
                                              against these states. However, 
                                              mostly it has preferred to 
                                              implement its policies through 
                                              surrogate movements such as the 
                                              MNR and UNITA which have operated 
                                              against the governments of the 
                                              Frontline States with its full 
                                              support. Members of the OAU, the 
                                              Frontline States and the general 
                                              international community have 
                                              consistently condemned the South 
                                              African Government's policy of 
                                              apartheid and South Africa's 
                                              continued illegal occupation and 
                                              administration of Namibia. 
                                              Moreover, the Frontline States 
                                              have expressed the policy of 
                                              giving diplomatic and political 
                                              support to the national liberation 
                                              movements such as the African 
                                              National Congress (ANC), the Pan-Africanist 
                                              Congress (PAC) and the South-West 
                                              Africa Peoples Organisation (SWAPO), 
                                              in their struggle against 
                                              colonialism and apartheid. This 
                                              commitment of the Frontline States 
                                              is in pursuance of successive 
                                              resolutions of the OAU and 
                                              numerous other UN General Assembly 
                                              resolutions condemning the policy 
                                              of apartheid and colonialism and 
                                              urging their elimination and the 
                                              exercise of self-determination by 
                                              all the peoples of South Africa 
                                              and Namibia.</span></p>

                                              between the problems and issues 
                                              arising from the confrontation 
                                              between South Africa and her 
                                              neighbours on the one hand and 
                                              those arising between the Republic 
                                              of Nicaragua and the United States 
                                              of America on the other, it is 
                                              surprising that the ICJ judgment 
                                              of June 1986 has not provoked a 
                                              flood of published and accessible 
                                              commentary on its relevance and 
                                              repercussions on similar events in 
                                              the Southern African region.5 This 
                                              paper is aimed at relating the 
                                              legal issues raised in the 
                                              judgment to the very important 
                                              events unfolding themselves in the 
                                              Southern African region. It cannot 
                                              be claimed that the paper will 
                                              amply fill the perceived lacuna 
                                              referred to but it is hoped that 
                                              it will in a small way shed light 
                                              on the areas of discussion. It is 
                                              further hoped that the paper will 
                                              show that rules of public 
                                              international law have an 
                                              important role to play in 
                                              promoting the cause of national 
                                              liberation, the elimination of 
                                              apartheid as a national policy for 
                                              South Africa and the promotion of 
                                              equality, independence and justice 
                                              and peace between South Africa and

                                              governments culminated in the

                                              apartheid in 1948 after the 
                                              National Party won the whites only

                                              movements such as the ANC, PAC and 
                                              others that the South African 
                                              government had no intention of

                                              Liberation Movements to expand

                                              In the 1960s and the early 1970s, 
                                              a substantial number of countries 
                                              in Southern Africa, ie the 
                                              Portuguese colonies of Angola and 
                                              Mozambique and the British colony 
                                              of Southern Rhodesia were still 
                                              under white colonial domination. 
                                              It must, however, be pointed out 
                                              that in all these territories wars 
                                              of national liberation had been 
                                              started. The tempo of these wars 
                                              had not however reached such a 
                                              pitch as to significantly worry 
                                              the Republic of South Africa whose 
                                              strategy was to hold these 
                                              territories as buffer zones or a 
                                              cordon between it and the states

                                              principal western allies, 
                                              particularly the United States of

                                              not seriously contemplated that

                                              could pose an effective military

                                              and imperialism which on the 
                                              surface seemed so firmly 
                                              established in these territories.6 
                                              In American eyes all those black 
                                              Africans who demanded equal

                                              political process of the white 
                                              dominated countries of Southern 
                                              Africa and who turned to the armed 
                                              struggle after the systematic 
                                              frustration of their aspirations, 
                                              were to be considered dangerous 
                                              destabilising elements. Thus, 
                                              national liberation movements were 
                                              perceived as a threat which could 
                                              open the way for communist 
                                              infiltration of the Southern 
                                              African Region by the USSR and the 
                                              Peoples Republic of China. In 
                                              order to counteract this, NSSM 39 
                                              listed five policy options, two of 
                                              which are pertinent here, and 
                                              which the United States could 
                                              adopt towards Africa. The US was

                                              protection of its economic, 
                                              scientific and strategic 
                                              interests, contain the possibility 
                                              of violence, encourage moderation 
                                              of rigid racial and colonial 
                                              attitudes of the whites and 
                                              minimize the opportunities for the 
                                              Chinese and the Soviets to spread 
                                              their influence in a region 
                                              traditionally considered a safe 
                                              sphere of influence for capitalism 
                                              and the west. The second policy 
                                              option contained in the document 
                                              was founded on the premises that 
                                              whites were in the region to stay 
                                              for good. As their hold on 
                                              economic, political and military 
                                              powers was virtually 
                                              unsurmountable, if any meaningful 
                                              change was to be effected, then it 
                                              had to be through them. It was 
                                              argued that there was no hope for 
                                              the black Africans through their 
                                              political and military 
                                              organisations to gain any 
                                              political rights through armed 
                                              struggle. Such a course of action 
                                              would only create violence, chaos 
                                              and instability, thereby creating 
                                              an opening for communist 
                                              penetration. It is submitted that 
                                              in this period the general 
                                              planning and thinking of 
                                              policy-makers in South Africa 
                                              coincided with the views stated in 
                                              the NSSM 39 document, as the 
                                              Republic of South Africa paraded 
                                              herself as the bastion of Western 
                                              democracy, stability and 
                                              prosperity in the Southern African

                                              In this period, there was a 
                                              dramatic change in the course of 
                                              events in the Southern African 
                                              Region. The intensification of the 
                                              guerrilla war against Portuguese 
                                              colonialism led to the sudden 
                                              collapse of Portuguese colonial 
                                              rule over Guinea Bissau, 
                                              Mozambique and Angola. The 
                                              emergence of Mozambique and Angola 
                                              as independent states proved an 
                                              important boost to the other 
                                              liberation movements in Southern 
                                              Africa especially ZANU-PF which 
                                              was based in Mozambique territory. 
                                              Now both Angola and Mozambique 
                                              joined the independent states of 
                                              Botswana, Tanzania and Zambia to 
                                              form the group of Frontline States 
                                              which effectively gave diplomatic, 
                                              political and material support to 
                                              the prosecution of the liberation 
                                              war in Rhodesia which was 
                                              successfully completed in 1979 
                                              following a negotiated settlement 
                                              and the conduct of national 
                                              elections in 1980. The emergence 
                                              of ZANU-PF as the 
                                              post-independence nationalist 
                                              government committed to joining 
                                              the ranks of the Frontline States 
                                              and giving diplomatic, political, 
                                              moral and material support to the 
                                              liberation struggle in South 
                                              Africa itself served further to 
                                              complicate the picture in South 
                                              African eyes. The initial reaction 
                                              of the government of the Republic 
                                              of South Africa to these new 
                                              developments was to attempt 
                                              deepening the economic dependence 
                                              of these state on South Africa. It 
                                              fashioned a policy of detente 
                                              aimed at bringing the newly 
                                              independent states into what is 
                                              planned as a “constellation of 
                                              states of Southern Africa” with 
                                              the Republic of South Africa as 
                                              the economic, financial and trade

                                              By this strategy, it was hoped 
                                              that South Africa’s economic, 
                                              technological and military might 
                                              would discourage its neigbhours 
                                              from giving any significant help 
                                              to the national liberation 
                                              movements such as the ANC, PAC and 
                                              SWAPO. However, with the 
                                              intensification of the activities 
                                              of particularly, the ANC inside 
                                              South Africa and the accession of 
                                              P W Botha, the former Minister of 
                                              Defence to power, South Africa’s 
                                              strategy changed to one of “total 
                                              onslaught.” According to this line 
                                              of thinking, the Republic of South 
                                              Africa, as the last remaining 
                                              bastion of white rule and 
                                              democracy in the Southern African 
                                              Region, was under an all out 
                                              assault on the communist countries 
                                              which were using the Frontline 
                                              States and organisations such as 
                                              the ANC. The reasoning went thus: 
                                              since the external threat to the 
                                              survival of South Africa was 
                                              total, the Republic’s response 
                                              must necessarily be comprehensive, 
                                              thereby encompassing economic, 
                                              military and where suitable, 
                                              diplomatic measure. Here, it 
                                              should be pointed out that the 
                                              “total strategy” had both domestic 
                                              and regional or international 
                                              aspects. Internally, it was geared 
                                              towards defusing the accelerated 
                                              radicalisation of the mass of the 
                                              peoples of South Africa which 
                                              started in the mid 1970s following 
                                              the Soweto student demonstrations. 
                                              These events created a groundswell 
                                              for the mobilisation of black 
                                              workers in the mines, farms and 
                                              other work places. A detailed 
                                              examination of the municipal 
                                              aspects of the total strategy is 
                                              thought to be beyond the scope of 
                                              this paper and will not be pursued 
                                              any further. It is enough to point 
                                              out that at the regional level, 
                                              the “total strategy” involved the 
                                              total mobilisation of all 
                                              resources against the Frontline

                                              military and diplomatic and has 
                                              come to be known as the policy of 
                                              destabilization which has been 
                                              deliberately planned and is being 
                                              implemented by the Republic of 
                                              South Africa against her 
                                              neighbours. On the military side, 
                                              Pretoria has adopted a two-pronged 
                                              approach, namely direct 
                                              intervention to flush out the ANC,

                                              which help the ANC. These policies 
                                              have become known in Southern

                                              strategy” has meant the increasing

                                              military might and the deployment 
                                              of this might directly against its

                                              South Africa has launched direct

                                              neighbouring countries. In

                                              Lesotho and Swaziland, the South

                                              conducted raids against alleged 
                                              ANC centres of operations almost 
                                              at will. On 14 June 1985, twelve 
                                              people were killed when a force of

                                              raided ten alleged centres of ANC

                                              capital of Botswana. Four houses 
                                              were destroyed and a visiting UN

                                              were killed in two separate raids

                                              October 1983, a group of South

                                              organisation was moved from

                                              In Mozambique, the tactics of the 
                                              MNR extended to the destruction of

                                              their operations to the kidnapping

                                              Yugoslav were killed when the MNR

                                              the Marsa province. In 1985, a

                                              that by January 1985 the 
                                              government had to declare that it 
                                              could no longer guarantee the

                                              arranged a programme of economic

                                              this attitude had changed 
                                              particularly when the new regime 
                                              let it be known that its aim was 
                                              the establishment of

                                              reason for the change of policy 
                                              was the fact that there were 
                                              reports of the involvement of the 
                                              Nicaraguan government in

                                              was cut off and the United States 
                                              commenced giving actively,

                                              armed opposition which grew out of 
                                              various elements, was organised 
                                              into two main groups, namely the 
                                              Fuerza Democratica Nicaraguense (FDM) 
                                              and the Alianza Revolucionaria 
                                              Democratica (ARDE). The Government 
                                              of the United States of America 
                                              advanced a number of reasons apart 
                                              from legal ones for its acts of 
                                              hostility against Nicaragua. These 
                                              range from allegations of the 
                                              undemocratic nature of the 
                                              Nicaraguan government, accusations 
                                              of human rights violations by the

                                              However, the court went on to 
                                              consider its views on the case, 
                                              taking into account as far

                                              which could have been raised by

                                              self-defence advanced by the

                                              the military and paramilitary

                                              Nicaragua.24 The reason for the 
                                              rejection of the defence of 
                                              collective self-defence claimed by 
                                              the United States was that the 
                                              international customary law 
                                              requirements for the exercise of 
                                              collective self-defence were 
                                              absent. As the court itself

                                              “The court must thus consider 
                                              whether, as the Respondent claims, 
                                              the acts in question of the United 
                                              States are justified by the 
                                              exercise of its right of 
                                              collective self-defence against an 
                                              armed attack. The court must 
                                              therefore establish whether the 
                                              circumstances required for the 
                                              exercise of this right of 
                                              self-defence are present and, if 
                                              so, whether the steps taken by the

                                              to the requirements of 
                                              international law. For the court

                                              of collective self-defence, it 
                                              must first find that Nicaragua 
                                              engaged in an armed attack against 
                                              El Salvador, Honduras or Costa

                                              On further examination, the court 
                                              concluded that even though arms 
                                              flowed through Nicaraguan 
                                              territory to the armed opposition 
                                              in El Salvador, this was not 
                                              tantamount to an armed attack on 
                                              that country to justify the 
                                              invocation of collective 
                                              self-defence. In respect of 
                                              Honduras and Costa Rica, the court 
                                              made the same findings.26 
                                              Furthermore, the court noted that 
                                              at the time of the conduct of 
                                              hostilities by the United States 
                                              against Nicaragua, the alleged 
                                              victim states, ie El Salvador, 
                                              Honduras and Costa Rica did not 
                                              complain of an armed attack by 
                                              Nicaragua and did not expressly 
                                              request military assistance from 
                                              the United States. In any case, 
                                              the court observed that the 
                                              conduct of the United States 
                                              itself did not show that it

                                              secondly that the intention of the 
                                              contras themselves was to 
                                              overthrow the present government

                                              responsibility.37 With respect to 
                                              the direct acts of aggression such 
                                              as raids and other acts of 
                                              destabilization against the 
                                              territories of the Frontline 
                                              States, the Republic of South 
                                              Africa will engage international 
                                              responsibility for the use of 
                                              force and violence contrary to the 
                                              norms of customary international 
                                              law. It is an important corollary 
                                              of the twin concepts of 
                                              sovereignty and equality of states 
                                              that every state shall respect the 
                                              territorial integrity of every 
                                              other state.38 However, public 
                                              international law allows for an 
                                              exception to the prohibition of 
                                              the use of force as a policy 
                                              instrument in international 
                                              relations. Where an armed attack 
                                              has been committed against a state 
                                              or group of states, at customary 
                                              international law and under 
                                              Article 51 of the UN Charter, the 
                                              victim states are entitled to 
                                              exercise individual self-defence 
                                              or collective self-defence. In the 
                                              relations between South Africa and 
                                              the Frontline States, the matter 
                                              at issue is whether South Africa 
                                              can plead self-defence in 
                                              justification for its attacks on 
                                              the territories of the Frontline 
                                              States. To succeed, South Africa 
                                              would have to establish a case of 
                                              armed attack against her territory 
                                              by the Frontline States either 
                                              individually or collectively. 
                                              There is no evidence of any of 
                                              these states having engaged either 
                                              individually or collectively in an 
                                              armed attack against the Republic 
                                              of South Africa.</span></p>

                                              Nevertheless, South Africa has 
                                              consistently contended that it is 
                                              entitled to defend itself against 
                                              raids or armed incursions 
                                              conducted by guerrillas of the ANC 
                                              and SWAPO and other national 
                                              liberation movements operating 
                                              from bases allegedly located 
                                              within the territories of the 
                                              Frontline States. The position of 
                                              the Frontline States is that these 
                                              national liberation movements do 
                                              not have any bases in their 
                                              territories. They however maintain 
                                              that they only give political, 
                                              diplomatic, moral and material 
                                              support to the liberation 
                                              movements who are conducting a war 
                                              for the realisation of the 
                                              principle of self-determination in 
                                              South Africa itself and Namibia.39 
                                              Furthermore, in contemporary 
                                              international law, principles of 
                                              customary law outlawing acts such 
                                              as aggression, slavery and racial 
                                              discrimination such as the 
                                              apartheid policies of South 
                                              Africa, are norms of jus Cogens.40 
                                              Indeed, the view has often been 
                                              expressed that apartheid should be 
                                              considered as an international 
                                              crime against humanity on the same 
                                              level as genocide. Thus the text

                                              of the right of self-defence and 
                                              will consequently not avail the 
                                              Republic of South Africa. This is 
                                              because the reason for the 
                                              campaign for national liberation 
                                              by the ANC, SWAPO and other 
                                              organisations is the policy of 
                                              racial discrimination embodied in 
                                              apartheid which is an 
                                              international crime.</span></p>

                                              Another possible defence which 
                                              could be raised by South Africa is 
                                              the right of hot pursuit.42 In 
                                              practice, the Republic of South 
                                              Africa has not explicitly 
                                              justified its raids on targets in 
                                              neighbouring countries by invoking 
                                              the right of hot pursuit on land. 
                                              The obvious reason for this is 
                                              that at customary international 
                                              law, there is no right of hot 
                                              pursuit on land in the absence of 
                                              treaty provisions. The right of 
                                              hot pursuit can only be exercised 
                                              at sea subject to strict legal 
                                              rules.43 An important distinction 
                                              between the case of Nicaragua v. 
                                              USA on the one hand and the South 
                                              Africa and the Frontline States on 
                                              the other is that while the latter 
                                              are neighbours the former are not. 
                                              The United States although sharing 
                                              no borders with Nicaragua supports 
                                              surrogate movements directly or 
                                              indirectly against Nicaragua.</span></p>

                                              The important question here is to 
                                              what extent the destabilization 
                                              campaign of these movements can be 
                                              attributed to the Republic of 
                                              South Africa. In the Nicaragua 
                                              case, the ICJ was faced with the 
                                              same problem concerning the 
                                              relationship between the United 
                                              States of America and the contras. 
                                              Even though there was evidence of 
                                              US diplomatic, military and 
                                              financial support for the contras, 
                                              the court was unable to attribute 
                                              responsibility to it for all the 
                                              actions of the contras violating 
                                              customary international law. 
                                              According to the court, the 
                                              important factor to consider was 
                                              whether the contras were under 
                                              such control and influence of the 
                                              USA that it could be said that it 
                                              planned, and directed their 
                                              policies, strategy and actions. In 
                                              this respect, the court observed:</span></p>

                                              the United States Government was

                                              the contras for legal purposes,

                                              the United States, there is no 
                                              clear evidence of the United 
                                              States having exercised such a 
                                              degree of control in all fields as 
                                              to justify treating the contras as

                                              development of at least the 
                                              insurgent movement in Mozambique, 
                                              namely, the MNR, the South African 
                                              Government was deeply involved in 
                                              its re-location from Zimbabwean 
                                              territory to the Northern 
                                              Transvaal. There is evidence that 
                                              members of the SADF planned and 
                                              directed the policies and strategy 
                                              of this organisations.46 It is

                                              Mozambique, the actions of the MNR 
                                              could be directly attributable to 
                                              the Republic of South Africa, as 
                                              that country exercised the 
                                              requisite control over the 
                                              formulation of the policies, 
                                              strategies and even the choice of

                                              the MNR. After 1984, there is 
                                              clear evidence that South Africa 
                                              has continued to supply arms to 
                                              the MNR and the other surrogate 
                                              movements. This, it is submitted, 
                                              constitutes an unlawful 
                                              intervention in the affairs of its 
                                              neighbours. It should be mentioned 
                                              that although, no clear cut 
                                              evidence has as yet emerged, some 
                                              commentators are of the view that 
                                              South Africa's interference in 
                                              Lesotho's internal affairs 
                                              actually resulted in the overthrow

                                              of the content of the principle of

                                              aggression pacts with the Republic 
                                              of South Africa. The best known of 
                                              these is the one concluded between 
                                              the Peoples Republic of Mozambique 
                                              and the Republic of South Africa 
                                              on 16 March 1984, which has now 
                                              come to be known as the Nkomati 
                                              Accord.52 A similar agreement had 
                                              been secretly signed between the 
                                              Republic of South Africa and the 
                                              Kingdom of Swaziland in February, 
                                              1982.53 South Africa also 
                                              concluded an agreement with Angola 
                                              to formalise a ceasefire on the 
                                              border between Angola and 
                                              Namibia.54 The aim of the 
                                              non-aggression treaties was to 
                                              enhance cross-border security 
                                              among the contracting parties. The 
                                              contracting parties were to 
                                              prevent their territories from 
                                              being used as launching pads for 
                                              attack by armed bands, and other 
                                              irregular force. The contracting 
                                              parties also committed themselves 
                                              to eliminating any camps, bases, 
                                              etc belonging to each armed bands, 
                                              and other irregular forces.55 What 
                                              is important to observe here is 
                                              that in spite of the fact that 
                                              these countries observed their 
                                              commitments by removing ANC 
                                              offices and representatives from 
                                              their territories, South Africa 
                                              never stopped helping the 
                                              insurgent movements, particularly 
                                              the MNR in Mozambique. Thus the 
                                              words of a journalist who 
                                              commented on the possible 
                                              scenarios of the post Nkomati era 
                                              proved prophetic.</span></p>

                                              the Nicaragua v. United States of 
                                              America has been to clarify and 
                                              bring to the forefront of 
                                              international relations, the 
                                              contemporary principles of 
                                              customary international law 
                                              governing the threat or use of 
                                              force by states. A state infringes 
                                              the prohibition of the use of 
                                              force or violence against the 
                                              territory of another state or its 
                                              nationals where it attacks it by 
                                              armed force, or organises, 
                                              finances and directs insurgents or 
                                              armed bands to do so. For the acts 
                                              of such insurgent movements to be 
                                              attributable to the state, there 
                                              must be the exercise of sufficient 
                                              control by that state. In the 
                                              absence of such control, the court 
                                              nevertheless held that the state 
                                              engaged international 
                                              responsibility where it supplies 
                                              and finances such armed bands to 
                                              operate against the territory and 
                                              government of another state. Such 
                                              conduct infringes the customary 
                                              international law principles of 
                                              respect for the territorial 
                                              sovereignty of states and 
                                              non-intervention in the internal 
                                              affairs of states. In all these 
                                              respects, South Africa’s conduct 
                                              towards the Frontline States has 
                                              infringed principles of customary 
                                              international law. If the majority 
                                              of these states had not in the 
                                              past formally presented any claims 
                                              for reparation by South Africa, it 
                                              is not because of doubts in the 
                                              international legal validity of 
                                              these claims but an expression of 
                                              secpticism about South Africa’s 
                                              commitment to the international 
                                              rule of law. This has been 
                                              abundantly borne out by South 
                                              Africa’s subsequent conduct after 
                                              the conclusion of non-aggression 
                                              pacts with some of the Frontline 
                                              States. As the futility of 
                                              pursuing formal legal claims 
                                              against South Africa has become 
                                              clearer, the Frontline States have 
                                              turned to closer co-operation in 
                                              their political, economic and 
                                              military relations. It is this 
                                              policy which has yielded 
                                              co-operation in the form of SADCC, 
                                              the tripartite military 
                                              co-operation between Mozambique, 
                                              Tanzania and Zimbabwe in order to 
                                              protect the ‘Beira corridor” and 
                                              other economic infrastructure 
                                              necessary for trade among the 
                                              Fontline States. It is though not 
                                              far fetched to suggest that the 
                                              same spirit of co-operation led to 
                                              the agreement for the 
                                              establishment of a joint security 
                                              commission between Mozambique and 
                                              Malawi last December.</span></p>

                                              be cited. South African armed 
                                              forces total 83,400, with reserves 
                                              of about 321,000. The air force 
                                              includes about 304 combat aircraft 
                                              and 10 combat helicopters. In 
                                              addition, there are about 145,500 
                                              paramilitary forces such as 
                                              commandos and police. The 1983-84 
                                              estimates of South Africa military 
                                              expenditure totalled about US$2.7 
                                              billion. In comparison, the major 
                                              Frontline States of Angola, 
                                              Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe 
                                              are estimated to have total 
                                              permanent force of about 114,250 
                                              with 188 combat aircraft and 
                                              helicopters. However, these forces 
                                              have a number of weaknesses; they 
                                              are not subject to a unified 
                                              command, they have different 
                                              training backgrounds and they use 
                                              assorted weapons from various 
                                              sources. In terms of military 
                                              expenditure, the total sum of 
                                              US$1.77 billion is spent by the
