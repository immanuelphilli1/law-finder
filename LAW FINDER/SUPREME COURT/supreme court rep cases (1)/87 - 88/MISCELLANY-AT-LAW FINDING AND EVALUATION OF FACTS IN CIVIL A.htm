                                              ONE of the most important elements 
                                              of proof in a civil action is the 
                                              finding which the trial judge 
                                              makes on the facts. A fact cannot 
                                              be considered as proved unless the 
                                              trial judge makes a favourable 
                                              finding .in respect of it. Civil 
                                              actions brought in our courts are 
                                              tried by a judge sitting alone 
                                              without a jury. He is the judge 
                                              both of the law and of the facts. 
                                              He must consider all the facts 
                                              presented to him and then apply 
                                              the law. There are three stages, 
                                              first the trial court must make 
                                              findings of the primary facts, 
                                              secondly, it must draw the proper 
                                              inferences from the facts and 
                                              thirdly, it must apply the law.</span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
                                              <span style="font-family: Arial">
                                              The primary facts in an action are 
                                              facts which are proved by the oral 
                                              testimony of witnesses or by the 
                                              production of a thing, for 
                                              example, a document. Where there 
                                              is no dispute as to the facts the 
                                              trial court will simply accept 
                                              them in so far as they are 
                                              relevant to the resolution of the 
                                              issues before it evaluate them and 
                                              apply the law. In the vast 
                                              majority of cases, however, the 
                                              facts are disputed. Confronted 
                                              with disputed facts, a trial court 
                                              must decide which version it 
                                              accepts as true and which it 
                                              rejects. In other words it must 
                                              make proper findings of facts. The 
                                              finding of facts is a duty which a 
                                              trial court must not evade in any 
                                              case where conflicting facts are 
                                              presented which require 
                                              resolution. Where a trial court 
                                              fails to make findings of fact or 
                                              makes the wrong findings it is 
                                              disabled from applying the correct 
                                              law and therefore giving a right 
                                              decision</span></p>

                                              This duty to make proper findings 
                                              of facts has been stressed in a 
                                              number of cases decided in our 
                                              courts. The principle which 
                                              emerges from these decisions is 
                                              that whenever the question, “what 
                                              are the facts found?” cannot be 
                                              answered with precision, then the 
                                              judgment of the trial court ought 
                                              to be held unsatisfactory. As Van 
                                              Lare JSC put it in Quaye v Mariamu 
                                              [1961] GLR 93, “It is a trial 
                                              judge’s duty to make up his mind 
                                              one way or the other on the 
                                              primary facts and when he has made 
                                              up his mind he should state his

                                              It must be emphasised that the 
                                              duty of the trial court is not 
                                              merely to make findings of fact 
                                              but to make proper findings of 
                                              fact. This means that findings of 
                                              fact must be based on evidence 
                                              which is properly before the 
                                              court. Findings of fact which are 
                                              not based on or supported by 
                                              evidence before the courts are 
                                              wrong and cannot stand. How wide 
                                              or how narrow should be the 
                                              coverage of the trial court in 
                                              making findings of facts? It 
                                              depends on the facts and 
                                              circumstances of each case. There 
                                              are, however, at least two 
                                              imperatives. First, the court must 
                                              consider all the evidence for both 
                                              sides so that it can ascertain the 
                                              areas of conflict if any. 
                                              Secondly, wherever there is 
                                              conflict the court must resolve 
                                              it. It may turn out that the court 
                                              does not accept both versions of 
                                              conflicting facts as true. In that 
                                              case this must be clearly stated 
                                              and the person who bears the 
                                              burden of proof of the particular 
                                              fact must fail.</span></p>

                                              In carrying out these imperatives 
                                              a trial court may have to make 
                                              specific findings on many separate 
                                              facts. On the other hand a 
                                              favourable or adverse finding in a 
                                              particular fact may well imply the 
                                              same finding in respect of other 
                                              related facts. The question is how 
                                              much can be left to inference. In 
                                              Quaye v Mariamu for example, the 
                                              appellate court set aside the 
                                              judgment of the trial court and 
                                              ordered a re-trial. The appellate 
                                              court listed facts on which the 
                                              trial court should have made 
                                              findings but did not. In Reindorf 
                                              v Amadu [1962] 1 GLR 508, the 
                                              complaint made against the 
                                              judgment of the trial court was 
                                              that it had not made definite 
                                              findings of fact on relevant 
                                              important issues. The trial court 
                                              did not deal with the specific 
                                              fact. In a short judgment the 
                                              Commissioner who tried the action 
                                              said he was more impressed by the 
                                              evidence led by the plaintiffs and 
                                              their witnesses and that they had 
                                              proved that they were the owners 
                                              of all that land known as Dome 
                                              land as shown on exhibit C by 
                                              their possession and occupation, 
                                              and trespass had been committed. 
                                              The traditional evidence by the 
                                              co-defendant and their witnesses 
                                              was inconsistent and unreliable 
                                              and in his view did not show any 
                                              evidence of occupation. He visited 
                                              and inspected the land in dispute 
                                              and the physical features as the 
                                              pillar marks supported the case 
                                              for the plaintiff. Korsah CJ and 
                                              Sarkodee Addo JSC refused to set 
                                              the judgment aside and order a new 
                                              trial on the ground that the 
                                              statement “clearly shows that the 
                                              court accepted the evidence of the 
                                              plaintiffs and their witnesses.” 
                                              Further they said that the learned 
                                              Commissioner having come to the 
                                              conclusion that the traditional 
                                              evidence led by the co-defendant 
                                              and their witnesses was 
                                              inconsistent and unreliable and 
                                              also that it did not show evidence 
                                              of possession and occupation, 
                                              there was no need for him to 
                                              discuss what each witness said, 
                                              having found that the plaintiffs 
                                              were in possession and having 
                                              accepted their traditional 
                                              evidence, he had made the basic 
                                              finding upon which he came to the 
                                              conclusion that the plaintiffs 
                                              were entitled to the declaration 
                                              they sought.</span></p>

                                              Cases involving traditional 
                                              evidence and the occupation of 
                                              land may perhaps present some 
                                              problems. Traditional evidence can 
                                              be long and is usually given by 
                                              more than one person. Is it proper 
                                              for the trial court simply to say 
                                              that it accepts one version of 
                                              traditional evidence in preference 
                                              to another, or must it make 
                                              specific findings on every aspect 
                                              of traditional evidence of which 
                                              testimony has been given? 
                                              Similarly in the case where the 
                                              possession of lands is in issue, 
                                              is it enough for a trial court to 
                                              hold that one party is in 
                                              possession or must specific

                                              It is not easy to give a straight 
                                              answer to these questions. Every 
                                              case must be considered on the 
                                              basis of the facts presented and

                                              cases do suggest however, that a 
                                              trial court must make findings on 
                                              all primary facts of which 
                                              evidence has been given and proof 
                                              of which is necessary to resolve a

                                              in assessing the credibility of a 
                                              witness? Section 80(2) of the 
                                              Evidence Decree, 1975 (NRCD 323) 
                                              provides a fairly good guide. The 
                                              section gives a list of matters 
                                              which may be considered in 
                                              deciding on the credibility of 
                                              witness;</span></p>

                                              It will be seen from this list 
                                              that assessing credibility of a 
                                              witness is partly objective and 
                                              partly subjective. The demeanour 
                                              of a witness for example may not 
                                              affect different judges in the 
                                              same way. Any decision based on 
                                              demeanour is largely subjective. 
                                              It is important not to over 
                                              emphasise this subjective element 
                                              in assessing credibility. 
                                              Demeanors of witnesses can be 
                                              great importance in some cases but 
                                              it can also mislead and it is 
                                              always necessary to consider 
                                              demeanour against the background 
                                              of all the evidence. An over 
                                              reliance on demeanour may result 
                                              in important aspects of the 
                                              evidence being overlooked or not 
                                              being given their proper weight. 
                                              It is necessary to bear in mind 
                                              that: </span></p>

                                              This is particularly so where 
                                              there is documentary evidence or 
                                              other evidence which is 
                                              independent of the oral testimony 
                                              of witnesses, eg. the actual 
                                              position of objects or the 
                                              measurements of a physical object 
                                              which is in existence and 
                                              available. Speaking of demeanour 
                                              reminds me of father Andrew. In my 
                                              student days there was a trial at 
                                              the Old Bailey which attracted 
                                              much attention. Two notorious 
                                              gangsters were charged for being 
                                              involved in a violent fight in 
                                              Soho. One of them called as his 
                                              witness an old retired Anglican 
                                              clergyman. This witness almost 
                                              seventy years old and venerable 
                                              looking so impressed the court by 
                                              his demeanour that his testimony 
                                              was believed and as a result the 
                                              accused who called him was 
                                              acquitted. Later the conscience 
                                              striken father Andrew confessed 
                                              that he had given false evidence. 
                                              Apparently he was in very reduced 
                                              circumstances and could not resist 
                                              the inducement offered to him to 
                                              come and tell a false story which 
                                              secured the acquittal of the 
                                              accused for whom he gave evidence. 
                                              The case raised quite a storm in 
                                              the London press. I do not know 
                                              the sequel to father Andrew’s 
                                              confession but it goes to show how 
                                              misleading demeanour can be.</span></p>

                                              Or take the case of a witness who 
                                              gave evidence at an inquiry in 
                                              Accra. He was an old man from 
                                              Kumasi very smart and impressive 
                                              in appearance who spoke with 
                                              impressive lucidity. He was giving 
                                              evidence against a magistrate who 
                                              had been accused of accepting a 
                                              bribe. In cross-examination he was 
                                              quite firm and unshaken. The 
                                              accused informed his counsel that 
                                              the man was one of a breed in 
                                              Kumasi known as professional 
                                              witnesses who for a consideration 
                                              would swear to anything. They were 
                                              usually very neat in appearance 
                                              and had very good memories. It was 
                                              bluntly put to the witness that he 
                                              was a “professional” witness which 
                                              he indignantly denied. His 
                                              evidence being that he was the go 
                                              between for the payment of the 
                                              bribe to the magistrate. He was 
                                              asked whether he thought it was 
                                              right to play such a role. His 
                                              startling answer was “Ye ye daa!” 
                                              The members of the Committee of 
                                              Inquiry were not, of course, 
                                              pleased by this answer and it 
                                              affected their assessment of his

                                              Amadu: “In reaching a decision a 
                                              judge sitting without a jury has a 
                                              dual function to perform. The 
                                              first function is the 
                                              establishment of particular facts, 
                                              that is the perceptive function. 
                                              The second function is an

                                              As already observed, evaluation is 
                                              really a process of deduction 
                                              based upon given facts. The 
                                              problem is that sometimes it is 
                                              not easy to draw a clear line 
                                              between a simple fact and what is 
                                              an inference from that fact. Since 
                                              evaluation is an exercise in 
                                              deduction it can be carried out by 
                                              any intelligent person given the 
                                              facts. The legal issues raised by 
                                              the deduction can, of course, only 
                                              be appreciated by a person trained

                                              When the judgment of a trial court

                                              is satisfied that the foundation 
                                              has been laid by the trial judge

                                              In Addision v A/S Norway Cement 
                                              Co. Ltd the trial judge found that 
                                              there was no contract between the 
                                              plaintiff and the defendants and 
                                              said he could not decide what a 
                                              sum of ¢80,000 mentioned in a 
                                              document represented. The Court of 
                                              Appeal held that there was ample 
                                              evidence from both parties to 
                                              support the existence of an oral 
                                              agreement and the sum of ¢80,000 
                                              was named pursuant to that 
                                              contract. Where there is ample 
                                              evidence on record on record to 
                                              support a fact which was not 
                                              considered by the trial court the 
                                              appellate court may make its own 
                                              findings. In the case of Adjin &amp; 
                                              Co v Kumaning the issue of 
                                              estoppel by long possession and 
                                              acquiescence was raised. The trial 
                                              court did not however consider the 
                                              issue. On appeal the Court of 
                                              Appeal found that there was more 
                                              than sufficient evidence before 
                                              the trial court to support the 
                                              plea estoppel.</span></p>

                                              In Atadi v Ladzekpo [1982-83] GLRD 
                                              15, the Court of Appeal held that 
                                              (i) where documentary evidence was 
                                              tended to make an oral testimony 
                                              improbable, it would be wrong for 
                                              the trial court to reject the 
                                              documentary evidence and to rely 
                                              on demeanour unless there was good 
                                              cause for doing so; (ii) whenever 
                                              the testimony of a party on a 
                                              crucial issue was in conflict with 
                                              the testimony of his own witness 
                                              it was not open to a trial court 
                                              to gloss over such conflict and 
                                              make a specific finding on that 
                                              issue in favour of the party whose 
                                              case contained the conflicting 
                                              evidence. The trial judge must 
                                              direct his mind to the conflict in 
                                              evidence and weigh the different 
                                              versions. If he did this he may,

                                              circumstances of the case make a 
                                              favourable finding notwithstanding 
                                              the conflict.</span></p>

                                              on a question of fact, the Court 
                                              of Appeal has to bear in mind that

                                              Before I conclude, I should like 
                                              to raise some few matters which 
                                              are not matters of law but which I 
                                              consider important because they 
                                              affect the judge’s ability and 
                                              capacity to make the right 
                                              findings and therefore draw the 
                                              correct inferences from the facts. 
                                              The matters referred to in section 
                                              80(2) of the Evidence Decree as 
                                              criteria for assessing credibility 
                                              require that a judge’s perception 
                                              and reasoning should be acute. 
                                              Anything which tends to impair 
                                              such perception and reasoning must 
                                              necessarily impair the quality of 
                                              the judgment. It is common to see 
                                              in judgments such remarks as “I am 
                                              impressed by the demeanour of the 
                                              witness, the “evidence of X had 
                                              the ring of truth.” Such a 
                                              statement pre-supposes a careful 
                                              perception of the witness and his 
                                              testimony. We must, however, 
                                              frankly ask ourselves how acute a 
                                              judge’s perception can be if most 
                                              of the time his face is glued to 
                                              the record book in the drudgery of 
                                              recording the evidence in 
                                              longhand. The answer seems obvious 
                                              to me. Or take a manner in which 
                                              proceedings are recorded in 
                                              different pages of a record book 
                                              so that at the end of the whole 
                                              case the judge has to hop from one 
                                              page to another to put together 
                                              the evidence of the facts on which 
                                              he must make his findings. 
                                              Furthermore, the longer the 
                                              interval between the time evidence 
                                              is taken and the time judgment is 
                                              given, the greater the risk that 
                                              the impressions created may have 
                                              faded or even become distorted.</span></p>

                                              These problems were adverted to 
                                              last year, and I am sure that they 
                                              will be raised by other speakers 
                                              as well as myself. I think the 
                                              time has come for a fitting 
                                              solution to be found. In the case 
                                              of recording evidence if the most 
                                              modern gadgetry cannot be 
                                              procured, it is surely not beyond 
                                              our means and resource to employ 
                                              competent shorthand writers for 
                                              each judge so that the Bench can 
                                              be freed from the drudgery of 
                                              recording in longhand. I am 
                                              informed that the public tribunals 
                                              have shorthand writers. Why can’t 
                                              we? Maybe it is a matter of “ask

                                              case I urge your lordships to ask 
                                              and to ask loudly and 
                                              persistently.</span></p>

                                              should be done to ensure that a

                                              work that sheer fatigue blunts the
