                                              If the Ghanaian legal system 
                                              adopts the same rules, certain 
                                              paradoxes will emerge. Where, by

                                              an issue is to be determined in 
                                              Ghanaian adjudication by reference 
                                              to the English legal system, the 
                                              relevant English rule could not be 
                                              invoked as such unless an expert 
                                              on English law were called to give 
                                              oral testimony. However, if Ghana 
                                              law were applicable, the Ghanaian 
                                              court could, of its own motion 
                                              (and would normally) refer to 
                                              English textbooks and other 
                                              writing, to inform itself of the 
                                              English common law rule in order 
                                              to determine whether to pronounce 
                                              it as Ghanaian law.</span></p>

                                              One way of getting around the 
                                              problem is by arguing that because 
                                              the common law is part of the law 
                                              of Ghana, no common law rule can 
                                              be regarded as a foreign law. This 
                                              would have the consequence that 
                                              rules of American, Nigerian, 
                                              Kenyan and English law (to take a 
                                              few examples) neither need to be 
                                              pleaded nor proved by expert 
                                              testimony. Even though the result 
                                              would be sensible, this route 
                                              would be technically incorrect, 
                                              and would produce its own 
                                              difficulties.&nbsp; Different common 
                                              law jurisdictions differ in the 
                                              formulation of specific rules, 
                                              even as they share a broad 
                                              approach and usually have many 
                                              identical rules,1a Indeed, the 
                                              English rules on proof of foreign 
                                              law assume differences between 
                                              common law jurisdictions: there 
                                              would otherwise be no basis for 
                                              requiring that other common law 
                                              rules be proved by a special 
                                              process. The implication of 
                                              accepting that argument would be 
                                              that every rule of every common 
                                              law jurisdiction would be a part 
                                              of the Ghanaian legal system. That 
                                              would be impossible where, on a 
                                              particular point, there is a 
                                              conflict of rules as between 
                                              common law jurisdictions. It would 
                                              be difficult, on the other hand, 
                                              to make a principled argument to 
                                              the effect that the common law as 
                                              determined in England should have 
                                              a special status in an independent 
                                              legal system.</span></p>
