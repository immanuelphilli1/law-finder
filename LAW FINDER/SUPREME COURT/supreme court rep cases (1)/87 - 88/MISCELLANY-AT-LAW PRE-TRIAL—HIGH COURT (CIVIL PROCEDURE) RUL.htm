                                              initiated and the time an action 
                                              comes on for trial there are many 
                                              important processes. These 
                                              processes which may conveniently 
                                              be described as pre-trial matters 
                                              cover a fairly wide range of 
                                              subjects. In this paper I will 
                                              consider the most important of 
                                              them and my emphasis will be on 
                                              those areas where the court has 
                                              powers and discretion which it may 
                                              be called upon to exercise. The 
                                              matters I will consider are (i) 
                                              parties and causes of action; (ii) 
                                              issue and service of writ; (iii)

                                              The two subjects of parties and 
                                              causes of action are so closely 
                                              related that it is convenient to 
                                              consider them together. Every 
                                              action begins because one person, 
                                              the plaintiff seeks a relief or 
                                              remedy against another person, the 
                                              defendant. Usually there is one 
                                              plaintiff suing one defendant, but 
                                              in appropriate circumstances there 
                                              may be more than one plaintiff or 
                                              more than one defendant. Any 
                                              person who is not under disability 
                                              may sue or be sued in his own 
                                              right or in a representative 
                                              capacity. A person is under 
                                              disability if he is an infant, 
                                              i.e. under the age of eighteen 
                                              years or if he is a patient, i.e. 
                                              by reason of mental disorder or 
                                              infirmity, he is not capable of 
                                              administering or managing his own 
                                              affairs.</span></p>

                                              Every person under disability must 
                                              sue by his next friend or defend 
                                              an action by his guardian ad litem 
                                              and the title of the suit must 
                                              disclose this fact. If an infact 
                                              sues without a next friend the 
                                              court as soon as it becomes aware 
                                              of this fact must stay all further 
                                              proceedings until a next friend is 
                                              added. The defendant in such a 
                                              case may apply to the court for an 
                                              order that a next friend should be 
                                              added or the writ set aside. 
                                              Similarly if a patient sues alone 
                                              without a next friend the court 
                                              must stay proceedings until a next 
                                              friend is added and the defendant 
                                              may apply for a stay of 
                                              proceedings until a next friend is 
                                              added. The same considerations 
                                              apply in the action as though he 
                                              were of full capacity. Proceedings 
                                              will be stayed until a guardian ad 
                                              litem is added. It is not proper 
                                              for the lawyer of a client under 
                                              disability to sue or defend or 
                                              continue proceedings without a 
                                              next friend or guardian ad litem. 
                                              Any lawyer who does so may incur

                                              acting for such a person must 
                                              certify that he is a fit and 
                                              proper person and that he has no

                                              is usually preferred. He must also

                                              of prosecuting the action and

                                              In a simple case one person sues 
                                              claiming a relief or remedy 
                                              against the other. Sometimes, 
                                              however, two or more persons may

                                              more persons may be joined as 
                                              plaintiffs or defendants where (if

                                              or against each of them) some 
                                              common question of law or fact 
                                              would arise (in all the actions) 
                                              and the relief or reliefs claimed

                                              transactions. In the case of 
                                              plaintiffs, for example, several 
                                              plaintiffs may be joined where

                                              result of a tort. Similarly in an

                                              subject-matter. The important 
                                              thing is that the subject-matter 
                                              or complaint against the several 
                                              defendants must involve the same

                                              circumstances. In actions for 
                                              recovery of land all those who are

                                              the land should be made 
                                              defendants. If many persons are

                                              must all be joined as defendants 
                                              in any action to enforce the 
                                              contract. If any of the

                                              as a defendant, those who are

                                              given very wide powers at any 
                                              stage of the proceedings either of 
                                              its own motion or upon application 
                                              to add, substitute or strike out 
                                              parties. If a person who ought to 
                                              be made a party has not been added 
                                              the court may order him to be 
                                              added. If a person has been 
                                              wrongly added the court can order 
                                              his name to be struck out and 
                                              another person substituted. In 
                                              exercising this power the court 
                                              must always take care to ensure 
                                              that neither party is prejudiced. 
                                              The overriding consideration is 
                                              whether a party will suffer 
                                              injustice or prejudice which 
                                              cannot be compensated for in cost. 
                                              A person can be added as plaintiff 
                                              only with his consent. Leave is 
                                              readily given to correct a genuine 
                                              mistake as to the name of a party 
                                              if the court is satisfied that 
                                              there is no reasonable doubts as 
                                              to the identity of the person 
                                              intending to sue or intended to be 
                                              sued. (See Order 15, r 6, GIHOC v.

                                              Ltd v. Attorney-General [1974] 1 
                                              GLR 88, CA. Simply stated a cause 
                                              of action arises whenever a 
                                              person’s legal rights are 
                                              infringed or threatened with 
                                              infringement and he seeks a remedy 
                                              or relief or a declaration of his 
                                              right from the court. A person 
                                              cannot successfully maintain an 
                                              action if he has no cause of 
                                              action. Indeed, it is an abuse of 
                                              the process of the court for a 
                                              plaintiff to initiate proceedings 
                                              when he has no cause of action.</span></p>

                                              The rules permit a plaintiff in 
                                              the same writ to join more than 
                                              one cause of action against the 
                                              same defendant. (See Order 15, r 1 
                                              (LI 1129)). The rules as to 
                                              joinder of parties and joinder of 
                                              causes of action are rules of 
                                              convenience. Where joinder will 
                                              delay or embarrass the defendant 
                                              or otherwise cause inconvenience, 
                                              the court has the power at its 
                                              discretion, to do any of the 
                                              following: (i) order separate 
                                              trials; (ii) confine the action to 
                                              some of the causes of action and 
                                              exclude others; (iii) order the 
                                              plaintiff or plaintiffs to elect 
                                              which cause of action shall be 
                                              proceeded with; (iv) order which 
                                              plaintiff should proceed and which 
                                              should be struck out; and (v) 
                                              prevent a defendant from being

                                              being required to attend

                                              Assuming that there are proper 
                                              parties and there is a reasonable 
                                              cause of action proceedings may be 
                                              commenced by the issue of a writ. 
                                              A writ must bear the title of the 
                                              action. This consists of the names 
                                              and addresses of the parties. If 
                                              the plaintiff sues or the 
                                              defendant is sued in some special 
                                              capacity, this must be indicated 
                                              on the writ. (See Orders 2, 3, 4 
                                              and 5 (1). Every writ of summons 
                                              must have an indorsement on it of 
                                              the plaintiff’s claim. The 
                                              indorsement is a concise statement 
                                              which should disclose the 
                                              plaintiff’s cause of action and 
                                              the relief or remedy sought by 
                                              him. The distinction between an 
                                              ordinary writ and a specially 
                                              indorsed writ is of no practical 
                                              importance because of the 
                                              provisions of the new Order 14 (LI

                                              writ of summons is in force for 
                                              twelve months from the date of 
                                              issue inclusive. It may, however, 
                                              be renewed if the defendant is not 
                                              served within the time. An 
                                              application for leave to renew 
                                              must be made before the twelve 
                                              months expire. The court may grant 
                                              leave to renew the writ for six 
                                              months from the date of renewal. A 
                                              renewed writ must be marked with 
                                              the date, month and year of such 
                                              renewal. The renewal of a writ can 
                                              be a matter of importance 
                                              particularly in a case where the 
                                              plaintiff’s claim may become 
                                              statute-barred after the twelve 
                                              months. In actual practice it may 
                                              be more prudent where there is 
                                              difficulty in serving a defendant 
                                              to apply for substituted service 
                                              before the twelve months expire. 
                                              (See Order 8). A writ must be 
                                              served on the defendant. It must 
                                              be served personally unless the 
                                              court otherwise orders. Order 9 
                                              makes provision for service in 
                                              particular cases and Order 10 
                                              provides for substituted service. 
                                              Service in Ghana is effected by 
                                              bailiffs of the court, who must

                                              the rules require that there shall 
                                              be service the court must make 
                                              sure that such service has been

                                              plaintiff’s claim is for a 
                                              liquidated amount he may ask for 
                                              final judgement. If the claim is 
                                              for general damages or in detinue, 
                                              the plaintiff may obtain

                                              writ shall recover possession of 
                                              the land. In such a case the 
                                              solicitor of the plaintiff must 
                                              give a certificate that the claim 
                                              is not based on a mortgage 
                                              transaction. Where the action is 
                                              based on a mortgage transaction 
                                              the plaintiff must obtain leave of 
                                              the court before entering judgment 
                                              in default of appearance. In all 
                                              other cases where there is default 
                                              of appearance the plaintiff upon

                                              with the writ, may proceed with 
                                              the action as if the defendant has 
                                              appeared.</span></p>

                                              appearance the plaintiff must 
                                              apply to the court for an order 
                                              that some proper person should be 
                                              appointed guardian ad litem to 
                                              appear and defend the action. A

                                              appearance may be set aside or 
                                              varied at the discretion of the 
                                              court. The party seeking to set 
                                              aside the judgment must in an 
                                              affidavit show that he has a 
                                              defence to the action if the 
                                              judgment was regularly obtained. 
                                              It is not necessary to obtain 
                                              leave to enter late appearance 
                                              before applying to have the 
                                              judgment set aside. An application 
                                              to set aside must be made promptly 
                                              and within a reasonable time. The 
                                              court always prefers to pronounce 
                                              a judgment on the merit or by 
                                              consent. It therefore readily sets 
                                              aside judgments obtained in 
                                              default. (See Evans v. Bartlam

                                              Pleadings are the written 
                                              statements which the parties in an 
                                              action serve on each other and in 
                                              which each sets forth in summary 
                                              the material facts on which he 
                                              relies in support of his claim in 
                                              defence. The term pleading 
                                              includes the statement of claim, 
                                              defence, counter-claim, reply and 
                                              defence to counter-claim and 
                                              pleading subsequent thereto and 
                                              particulars of pleadings. It does 
                                              not include a general indorsement 
                                              on a writ. What is the purpose of 
                                              pleadings? Pleadings provide a 
                                              method for stating and resolving 
                                              questions of fact or of mixed law 
                                              and facts in dispute between the 
                                              parties to the proceedings. They 
                                              clearly define the issues or 
                                              questions in dispute between the 
                                              parties which the court is called 
                                              upon to decide. Pleadings give 
                                              fair and proper notice of each 
                                              party’s case to his opponent so 
                                              that the latter can meet it. By 
                                              the pleadings the court is able to 
                                              see the precise matters in issue 
                                              between the parties which the 
                                              court must resolve. The limits of 
                                              the action are thus settled and it 
                                              cannot go beyond the bounds of the 
                                              pleadings except after amendment 
                                              properly made. The pleadings also 
                                              provide a permanent record from 
                                              which the nature of the claim and 
                                              defence and the issues and 
                                              questions raised in the action 
                                              decided may be ascertained. This 
                                              makes it possible in future 
                                              actions to prevent litigation by 
                                              the parties and their privies upon 
                                              matters already adjudicated 
                                              between the parties.</span></p>

                                              In any dispute the court must 
                                              focus its attention on the 
                                              pleadings for the whole case must 
                                              necessarily revolve around them. 
                                              Each party can make his case as is 
                                              disclosed by the pleadings and no 
                                              departure will be allowed except 
                                              after amendment. It is obvious 
                                              that the quality of a party’s 
                                              pleadings has a lot to do with 
                                              whether he wins or loses his case. 
                                              There are certain cardinal rules 
                                              of pleadings, which must always be 
                                              borne in mind. A failure to 
                                              observe any of them can lead to 
                                              serious damage to a party’s case. 
                                              These rules are that:</span></p>

                                              He cannot plead one set of facts 
                                              and at the trial base his case on 
                                              different facts. Any attempt to 
                                              depart from one’s pleadings will 
                                              give rise to objection. If for any

                                              new facts, it is necessary to

                                              The court has wide powers to 
                                              enforce the rules of pleadings and 
                                              strike out or amend pleadings or

                                              which are scandalous, frivolous or 
                                              vexatious or are likely to cause

                                              of the court. This power arises 
                                              under Order 19, rule 29 and Order 
                                              25, rule 4. The power must be 
                                              exercised with great caution 
                                              because its effect is to deprive a 
                                              party of the right to a full 
                                              trial. It will not be exercised 
                                              except in a very clear case. (See

                                              court will, however, stay or even

                                              application is made is that the

                                              evidence is admissible. The court

                                              evidence is, however, admissible 
                                              where the application is based on 
                                              other grounds, eg it is frivolous 
                                              or likely to cause delay or an 
                                              abuse of the process. The power

                                              entails a minute examination of

                                              court amend any pleadings of his 
                                              once at any time before pleadings 
                                              close. If he does so he must serve 
                                              the proposed amendment on his 
                                              opponent who may apply to the 
                                              court to disallow the amendment. 
                                              In practice most amendments are 
                                              made with leave of the court. 
                                              Amendments may be made at any 
                                              stage of the proceedings. The 
                                              power of the court to grant or 
                                              refuse leave to amend is 
                                              discretionary. The discretion must 
                                              be exercised so as to do what 
                                              justice may require in each 
                                              particular case and upon such 
                                              terms as the court may direct. 
                                              Application for leave made before 
                                              trial are more readily granted. In 
                                              such an amendment, the plaintiff 
                                              may add a new cause of action and 
                                              the defendant a new ground of 
                                              defence. Leave to amend is not so 
                                              readily granted at the trial. If 
                                              the amendment is really necessary 
                                              and it will not cause injustice to 
                                              the other party it will be allowed 
                                              subject to costs and the case 
                                              being adjourned to enable the 
                                              other side to plead to the 
                                              amendment. (Even where the 
                                              amendment is such as to change 
                                              completely a plaintiff’s cause of 
                                              action leave to amend may be given

                                              It is essential that when leave to

                                              any pleading as amended. Every

                                              in an action and prepare the 
                                              ground for trial. For the purpose 
                                              the rules give very wide powers to 
                                              the court to give directions as to

                                              list of matters in respect of 
                                              which the court may give 
                                              directions or make orders, eg 
                                              discovery and inspection of 
                                              documents, and how particular 
                                              facts may be proved at the trial. 
                                              If the powers of the court are 
                                              properly exercised on the hearing 
                                              of the summons for directions the 
                                              course of the proceedings can be 
                                              greatly facilitated. Matters like

                                              making orders to plans, ensuring 
                                              that the pleadings are in 
                                              order—whether the matter can be

                                              all the judges ask is whether the 
                                              issues are agreed. If both counsel 
                                              say yes, he proceeds to give a 
                                              date or direct that the registrar 
                                              should fix a date.</span></p>

                                              Sometimes the judge may not 
                                              himself have read the papers. The 
                                              result of all this is that some 
                                              lawyers are actually advocating 
                                              the abolition of the summons for 
                                              directions.</span></p>

                                              It is necessary that judges 
                                              recognise and use the powers they 
                                              have under Order 30 of the Rules. 
                                              An important prerequisite is that 
                                              the judge must himself study all 
                                              the pleadings so that he can be 
                                              sure first that they are in order; 
                                              secondly that there are triable 
                                              issues raised by the pleadings and 
                                              thirdly that these issues have 
                                              been properly set out. If the 
                                              pleadings are defective the judge 
                                              must be ready to deal with them in 
                                              the proper manner, eg by using his 
                                              powers under Order 19, rule 29. 
                                              Sometimes it is apparent on the 
                                              fact of the pleadings that the 
                                              facts are not seriously in issue 
                                              and that the matter can be 
                                              dispossed of by legal argument. In 
                                              such a case a judge should not 
                                              hesitate to so order. It saves 
                                              much time and expense and lightens 
                                              the judge’s own burdens.</span></td>
