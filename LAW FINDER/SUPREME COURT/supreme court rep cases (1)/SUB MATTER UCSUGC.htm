												Subsequent to the allocation but

												one Clifford Cudjoe, was 
												permitted to live in the houe on 
												his return from Burma Campaign

												World War.&nbsp; He lived there with 
												another son of Moses Neequaye.&nbsp;

												Administration of Estate -

												&#8211; <b>Caveat -</b>&nbsp; This is an 
												appeal against the unanimous 
												decision of the Court of Appeal 
												which had dismissed the 
												appellants' appeal and upheld 
												the decision of the trial High 
												Court dismissing their claim for 
												grant of letters of 
												administration in respect of 
												their late father's estate. The 
												trial High Court held that the 
												issue as to whether it was the 
												maternal or the paternal family 
												of the appellants' late father 
												that was entitled to administer 
												the estate of their late father, 
												Edward Daniel Lartey, had been 
												decided earlier in 1955 by the 
												High Court, Accra, in favour of 
												the respondent's predecessor 
												called Ben Quao Mensah. As such, 
												the appellants were estopped per 
												rem judicatam by the said 
												earlier decision from 
												relitigating the matter. That 
												this was so, especially, as the 
												appellants never appealed 
												against the said earlier 
												decision to enable an appellate 
												court set it aside. The 1st, 2nd 
												and 3rd plaintiffs/appellants 
												are the children of the late 
												Edward Daniel Lartey whose 
												estate was the subject of the 
												various actions, and the 4th 
												plaintiff/appellant is the 
												grand-niece of the said 
												deceased. The appellants took 
												this action at the High Court, 
												Accra The defendant/respondent, 
												Abban Otoo, is a member of the 
												deceased's maternal family. In 
												an action which immediately 
												preceded the action now before 
												us, the appellants sued the 
												respondent's predecessor, Ben 
												Quao Mensah, in respect of the 
												same estate of their said late 
												father. When the said Ben Quao 
												Mensah died in the course of 
												that litigation, the respondent 
												herein was appointed by the 
												maternal family to apply to be 
												substituted for the said Ben 
												Quao Mensah. This action was, 
												however, later struck out. The 
												appellants then applied for 
												letters of administration to 
												administer their late father's 
												estate. The respondent, 
												obviously on the authority of 
												the maternal family, caveated. 
												This resulted in the present 
												action being taken.- <b>

												- It is the jurisdiction of the 
												High Court to entertain this 
												writ which is at the heart of 
												the application before this 
												Court.&nbsp; The applicant initially 
												made an application to the High 
												Court (Commercial Division), 
												seeking the dismissal of the 
												action on the ground that it was 
												an abuse of the judicial 
												process, since the High Court 
												had already ruled on the 
												matter.&nbsp; Her Ladyship Torkornoo 
												J. dismissed this application, 
												explaining that the High Court 
												becomes <i>functus officio</i> 
												only in relation to matters that 
												it had already dealt with.&nbsp; She 
												was of the view that the entry 
												of judgment filed was a manifest 
												misrepresentation of the 
												agreement reached by the parties 
												and which had been recorded by 
												her sister in her ruling of 20<sup>th</sup> 
												June 2006.&nbsp; Accordingly, she 
												dismissed the application in a 
												ruling dated 28<sup>th</sup> 
												February 2008 Dissatisfied with 
												that outcome, the applicant bank 
												has filed the present 
												application seeking to invoke 
												the supervisory jurisdiction of 
												the Supreme Court over the court 
												below for an order of certiorari 
												to quash the ruling of the 
												learned trial judge dated 28<sup>th</sup> 
												February 2008 and prohibiting 
												her from continuing with 
												proceedings in this suit.&nbsp; The 
												ground on which this application 
												has been brought is that the 
												High Court has no jurisdiction 
												to entertain the interested 
												parties&#8217; fresh action, since to 
												allow the court below to 
												exercise jurisdiction would mean

                                                damages awarded were on the low 
                                                side. The appeal was dismissed.

												Armed Forces - Court Martial - 
												Good order and discipline</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial">- 
												The complainant in this case was 
												an officer in the Ghana Armed 
												Forces. He was the Provost 
												Marshall. His duties touched on 
												security and discipline within 
												the armed Forces. The appellant 
												on the other hand was a 
												corporal. He had had 19 years 
												military service to his 
												credit.On the night of 19th 
												November, 1996, the appellant 
												was alleged to have done 
												something very strange. The 
												appellant who was then living in 
												barracks in the Burma Camp in 
												Accra had earlier in the day 
												left the barracks to town. He 
												spent much time in town. At the 
												time he was driving back to the 
												barracks at about 11.30 p.m. the 
												Provost Marshall was also 
												driving into the Burma Camp. 
												According to the prosecution the 
												Provost Marshall stopped at the 
												Burma Camp traffic light because 
												the red light was on, meaning 
												all vehicles must stop. But as 
												he waited, a car from behind 
												drove past him, ignoring the red 
												signal. When the green light 
												came on, the Provost Marshall 
												decided to find out the person 
												who drove through the red light. 
												He therefore followed the other 
												car and found it parked near a 
												house. The owner came out and 
												was about to enter his room when 
												the Provost Marshall walked up 
												to him and, recognizing the 
												appellant, the Provost Marshall 
												asked why he drove through the 
												red traffic light. The appellant 
												said the red light was not on. 
												The denial surprised the 
												complainant and he asked for the 
												appellant&#8217;s identity card. 
												According to the prosecution the 
												appellant produced the card; but 
												when he realized that the 
												complainant intended to keep the 
												card and also lodge a complaint 
												against him he decided to 
												collect back his card. During 
												the struggle he was alleged to 
												have hit the complainant in the 
												face with a blow. The 
												complainant fell down and the 
												appellant sat over him and 
												rained blows on him. Some people 
												who were around the scene went 
												to the rescue of the 
												complainant. When freed, the 
												complainant rushed to the 
												military police and reported the 
												incident. Men were sent to 
												arrest the appellant but the 
												appellant was combative and 
												engaged them in a fight. It took 
												a three-man reinforcement to 
												overpower the appellant and 
												confine him to cells. He was 
												later charged with the typically 
												military offences of (1) 
												striking a superior officer, (2) 
												use of violence against a 
												superior officer and (3) conduct 
												prejudicial to good order and 
												discipline. The appellant denied 
												the offences.- <b>

												</span></b>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The quintessence of the 
												Respondent&#8217;s case against the 
												Appellant is that as a result of 
												its negligence in opening a bank 
												account at its Liberia Road 
												Branch, Accra, with the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Defendant, as well as its 
												further negligence in paying 
												over the &#8220;colossal sum of 
												$82,000&#8221; to the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Defendant, the Respondent has 
												sustained loss of similar 
												magnitude and the Appellant 
												should make good that loss. This 
												submission of negligence was 
												based on section 81 of our Bills 
												of Exchange Act 1961 (Act 55) 
												hereinafter &#8220;BEA&#8221;. The courts 
												below accepted it and gave 
												judgment for the Respondent. The 
												Appellant says the Court of 
												Appeal erred and invites Your 
												Lordships to reverse that Court.<b>
												</b>In the very first paragraph 
												if its judgment the Court of 
												Appeal noted: &#8220;It (the case) 
												dramatizes the horrors of some 
												of the sophisticated banking 
												frauds often heard of in these 
												days. They are mostly 
												technically designed criminal 
												offences capable of detection 
												only through the same lenses of 
												high technology typical of our 
												current computer age. The 
												emphasis here is that modern 
												criminals have left the streets 
												and are using high technology to 
												infiltrate our banking and other 
												financial institutions for their 
												fraudulent operations. It is 
												within this background that the 
												facts of this case must be 
												scrutinized and analysed.&#8221;<b>
												</b>My Lords, this appeal deals 
												with an important aspect of 
												modern banking; ie. 
												international funds transfer. 
												The payment message in this case 
												was communicated by electronic 
												means. A few centuries ago, the 
												world mercantile community 
												invented negotiable instruments 
												to facilitate international 
												trade. The bill of exchange was 
												also developed to obviate the 
												necessity of carrying large sums 
												of money across international 
												frontiers. Laws were ultimately 
												enacted to cover their use and 
												new nomenclature was devised to 
												distinguish various parties to a 
												bill,&nbsp;As a special function of 
												banking, foreign trade was 
												financed by commercial 
												documentary credits (popularly 
												known as &#8220;letters of credit&#8221;).&nbsp;<b><a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="../2006A/VICTORIA%20ISLAND%20PROPERTIES%20LTD%20%20&%20ANZ%20GRINDLAYS%20BANK%20LTD%20%20%20v%20STANDARD%20CHARTERED%20BANK%20GH%20LTD%20&%20E.%20O.%20EFFIONG.htm"><span style="text-decoration: none">VICTORIA

												Building contract &#8211; Agreement &#8211;

												The Plaintiff&#8217;s story, as set 
												out in his statement of claim, 
												was that he owned a piece of 
												land near Achimota, Accra, and, 
												around 1991, agreed with the 
												Defendant that he should 
												construct a building for the 
												Plaintiff on that piece of 
												land.&nbsp; The agreed price for this 
												service was 17 million cedis.&nbsp; 
												The Plaintiff paid, in 1991, 
												through his father, 14 million 
												cedis out of this agreed price 
												to the Defendant.&nbsp; The Plaintiff 
												claimed that by 1994 the 
												building had been roofed and he 
												put a caretaker into it, pending 
												the final completion of the 
												construction.&nbsp; When at this 
												point the Defendant demanded 
												payment of 3 million cedis, 
												being the balance of the agreed 
												contract price, the Plaintiff 
												rejected the demand, arguing 
												that by the terms of the 
												agreement the balance was to be 
												paid when the building had been 
												completed and the keys handed 
												over to him.&nbsp; The Defendant then 
												threatened to sell the building, 
												started showing prospective 
												purchasers around the property 
												and harassed the Plaintiff&#8217;s 
												caretaker.The Defendant&#8217;s 
												version of events was 
												different.&nbsp; He averred that the 
												land near Achimota belonged to 
												him and that he was developing 
												it into a dwelling house when 
												the Plaintiff requested to buy 
												it through his father.&nbsp; He 
												averred further that the 
												building was completed in 1994, 
												but the Plaintiff failed to pay 
												the balance of the contract 
												price, namely the 3 million 
												cedis referred to above, in 
												spite of repeated demands.&nbsp; 
												Therefore, after waiting for a 
												long period without receiving 
												payment, he agreed with the 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s father, who acted as 
												agent for the Plaintiff in the 
												transaction, to rescind the 
												contract and refund the 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s money to him.&nbsp; In 
												accordance with this agreement, 
												he refunded 4 million cedis by 
												cheque to the father on 12th 
												September 1994.&nbsp; The Defendant 
												had subsequently offered to 
												refund the balance of 10 million 
												cedis to the Plaintiff&#8217;s 
												father.&nbsp; Although, he was 
												willing to accept the refund, he 
												had been prevailed upon by the 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s mother, who was the 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s lawful attorney in 
												this suit, to refuse the refund

												<b>transfer -</b> The facts in 
												this case are undisputed and 
												relatively simple.&nbsp; The 
												Interested Party in this case 
												applied to the High Court to 
												dismiss an action that had been 
												brought by the applicant and 
												other plaintiffs in this case.&nbsp; 
												Its reason for bringing that 
												application was that because of 
												the opinion expressed by the 
												Supreme Court on 23<sup>rd</sup> 
												July 2008 on certain 
												constitutional issues referred 
												to it by the High Court in this 
												case, no cause of action 
												survived that the applicant 
												could legitimately pursue.&nbsp; 
												Although the reference had been 
												made by His Lordship Justice 
												Abada, the Interested Party&#8217;s 
												application was placed before 
												His Lordship Justice Edward 
												Amoako Asante, by an order of 
												transfer made by the Chief 
												Justice.&nbsp; Justice Asante ruled 
												on 20<sup>th</sup> August 2008 
												upholding the Interested Party&#8217;s 
												application and characterising 
												the applicant&#8217;s suit in the 
												court below as &#8221;unmeritorious 
												and an abuse of the judicial 
												process to unlawfully challenge 
												a legally sanctioned act.&#8221;&nbsp; 
												Aggrieved by this outcome, the 
												applicant filed an appeal and 
												filed an application for an 
												interim injunction on 21st 
												August 2008, which was fixed for 
												hearing on 3<sup>rd</sup> 
												September 2008.&nbsp; On 3<sup>rd</sup> 
												September 2008 the case was 
												called before Asante J, who 
												adjourned it to 22<sup>nd</sup> 
												October 2008 for hearing.&nbsp; 
												However, on the 22<sup>nd</sup> 
												October, when the applicant and 
												the other plaintiffs in the suit 
												appeared in the High Court, Fast 
												Track 1, Justice Asante was not 
												available and so his clerk 
												adjourned the case to 6<sup>th</sup> 
												November 2008.&nbsp; On the same day, 
												however, the case was also 
												called in the High Court, Fast 
												Track 2, presided over by 
												Justice Ofori-Atta.&nbsp; He heard 
												submissions by counsel for the 
												Interested Party, in the absence 
												of the applicant and its 
												counsel, and fixed 4<sup>th</sup> 
												November 2008 for his ruling.On 
												4<sup>th</sup> November, the 
												applicant and its counsel 
												appeared before Ofori-Atta J and 
												raised an objection to his 
												delivering a ruling in the case 
												on the ground that the case had 
												not been transferred to him by 
												the Chief Justice.&nbsp; Justice 
												Ofori-Atta nevertheless 
												proceeded to give his ruling, 
												dismissing the application for 
												interim injunction.&nbsp; The 
												applicant contends that this 
												ruling and the hearing of the 
												application on 22<sup>nd</sup> 
												October should be quashed by 
												this Court as having been made 
												without jurisdiction by 
												Ofori-Atta J, since there was no

												- <b>Kingmakers -</b> he facts 
												of the case are as follows: At 
												the election meeting, the Second 
												Respondent invited all 
												contestants to the vacant Wa 
												skin to identify themselves, 
												whereupon the Petitioner and the 
												First Respondent/Appellant/ 
												Appellant, subsequently referred 
												to in this judgment as the First 
												Respondent, identified 
												themselves. The Petitioner and 
												the First Respondent both made a 
												presentation to the meeting of 
												their &quot;manifesto&quot;, setting out 
												the reasons why they should be 
												elected to the vacant skin of Wa. 
												In his presentation, the 
												Petitioner averred that he had 
												reminded the meeting that in 
												1951 during the reign of Wa Na 
												Mumuni Koray of Jonyuobi, the 
												Wala Traditional Council had 
												decided and resolved that there 
												were four gates to the Wa 
												Paramountcy and that since that 
												declaration by the Traditional 
												Council in 1951 only the Nakpaha 
												gate had not had its turn in 
												providing a chief for Wa. He 
												contended therefore that, in 
												fairness, it was now the turn of 
												the Nakpaha gate to present a 
												candidate to the vacant Wa skin. 
												After the presentations by the 
												candidates, the Kingmakers 
												retired into an inner room. At 
												this point, the Froko, Alhaji 
												Iddrisu, delegated his brother (Hamaru 
												Froko) to act for him in the 
												proceedings in the inner 
												room.The central controversy in 
												this case revolves round what 
												took place in the inner room. 
												The Petitioner averred that in 
												the inner room he was elected by 
												the Tendaana and this was 
												concurred in by the Yeri Na and 
												Froko. He further averred that 
												the Tendaana made it plain that 
												his election of the Petitioner 
												was based on the fact that it 
												was now the turn of Nakpaha 
												gate's nominee to be elected Wa 
												Na in the interest of fairness. 
												The Petitioner's contention was 
												that, since he was the nominee 
												of Nakpaha Gate and had their 
												vote, in addition to the three 
												other Kingmakers already 
												referred to, he had the majority 
												support of the Kingmakers. The 
												Petitioner claimed that he 
												emerged from the inner room to 
												where the observers of the 
												election were seated and clapped 
												his hands and started 
												jubilating. The Tendaana also 
												came out and made the 
												declaration that the Petitioner 
												had been chosen as Wa Na.Next, 
												according to the Petitioner, to 
												his utter shock and disbelief, 
												the Second Respondent announced 
												to the observers that five of 
												the Kingmakers had elected the 
												Busa Na, who had, in turn, 
												transferred his election to the 
												First Respondent and that the 
												Second Respondent had further 
												announced that two of the 
												Kingmakers were not sure of 
												which candidate to choose. The 
												Petitioner contended that the 
												Busa Na was not a candidate for 
												the Wa skin and thereforehis 
												purported election was null and 
												void.- <b>

												In this case an order was on the 
												2nd day of November, 1988 made 
												by the Brong-Ahafo Regional 
												House of Chiefs in Chieftaincy 
												proceedings before it as appears 
												at page 26 lines 18-24 of the 
												Record of Appeal, as follows: 
												&#8220;We order the lst petitioner 
												Nana Kofi Mensah, the 3rd Nana 
												Kwasi Wuromo the Krontihene of 
												Banda, the 4th petitioner Nana 
												Sodoyi the Oyokohene of Banda 
												and Nana Sie Nyomo the 
												Akyeamehene to convey the black 
												stool to the Petelli Royal 
												House, Kabrena not later than 
												15/11/88.&#8221; (emphasis supplied) 
												The Appellant belongs to the 
												Kralongo Royal House of Banda 
												from which the Black Stool was 
												to be returned to the other 
												royal House of Banda, namely, 
												the Petelli Royal House. An 
												Appeal from the judgment and 
												said order the of Brong-Ahafo 
												Regional House of Chiefs was 
												dismissed on the 29th day of 
												March, 1991 by the National 
												House of Chiefs.&nbsp; A further 
												appeal to this court was 
												dismissed on the 6th day of 
												June, 1995.The application for 
												attachment for contempt against 
												the appellant was filed in the 
												High Court, Sunyani on the 26th 
												day of January, 1999. It is 
												alleged that the appellant 
												indulged in acts contemptuous of 
												the order as from 23rd day of 
												December, 1997; and the Court of 
												Appeal so found and held.&nbsp; It is 
												however, admitted that the Banda 
												Stool was returned to the 
												respondent&#8217;s family on the 15th 
												day of September, 1998. Several 
												arguments had been addressed to 
												us as to whether the application 
												for contempt against the 
												appellant was or was not a cause 
												or matter affecting 
												Chieftaincy.&nbsp; However, on 
												perusal of the record of appeal 
												we felt that the matter was not 
												a cause or matter affecting 
												chieftaincy but that if the 
												order of the Brong-Ahafo 
												Regional House of Chiefs had 
												lapsed before the alleged acts 
												of contempt by the appellant 
												then the question of contempt 
												could not arise. <b>

												- Later in 1928, the Chief of 
												Duakwa, Nana Amuakwa I, offered 
												the land to Nana Kofi Antwi I 
												for sale. Nana Kofi Antwi I 
												accepted the offer, and the land 
												was sold to him for #465.10. 
												When the money was paid a 
												receipt was issued to 
												acknowledge payment. This was 
												tendered at the trial as Exhibit 
												A. The plaintiff tendered 
												Exhibit B dated 1930 prepared to 
												evidence the sale, to prove his 
												assertion of the sale of the 
												land to his predecessor in 
												title. The plaintiff traced the 
												sequence of succession that when 
												Nana Kofi Antwi I died in 1930; 
												he was succeeded by Nana Kofi 
												Antwi II, till it got to the 
												turn of Nana Kofi Antwi V, the 
												present plaintiff at the 
												trial.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It was in 1976 when 
												Nana Kofi Antwi II died that a 
												faction of the Ayensuako elders 
												enstooled one Kwaku Arhin, a 
												grand-child of Osimpo, as the 
												chief of Ayensuako. Ofinam&#8217;s 
												successors brought an action at 
												the Awutu Traditional Council 
												seeking an order to destool 
												Kwaku Arhin. Kwaku Arhin himself 
												conceded that he was not a chief 
												of Ayensuako and therefore 
												withdrew his claim. Accordingly 
												Nai Awulabi was enstooled as 
												Nana Kofi Antwi IV and 
												controlled the lands of Ofinam 
												until he died in 1997. In 2000, 
												the plaintiff was enstooled as 
												Nana Kofi Antwi V and one 
												Akyeampong slaughtered a sheep 
												to claim the land in dispute, 
												for it had been jointly 
												purchased by Ofinam and Osimpo 
												and he had come to claim the 
												portion that went to Osimpo his 
												ancestor. His action was opposed 
												by the plaintiff who reported 
												the matter to the Police. It was 
												after these events that it came 
												to light that the second 
												defendant had felled fifty palm 
												trees on the land; it was 
												further revealed it was the 
												first defendant who authorized 
												him to do that. The result was 
												the institution of the suit that

												This is an appeal from the

												of Chiefs. On 3rd February, 
												1989, the 
												Petitioners/Respondents herein 
												(some of whom are admitted to be 
												kingmakers of the Owusu-Asare 
												Paramount Stool of Atebubu) 
												petitioned the Brong-Ahafo 
												Regional House of Chiefs for the 
												removal of the 
												Respondent/Appellant herein as 
												the Omanhene (Paramount Chief) 
												of the Atebubu Traditional Area. 
												They sought &#8212; . A declaration 
												that the Respondent herein as 
												occupant of Owusu-Asare Stool '(Atebubu 
												Paramount Stool) has violated 
												customs and taboos of Atebubu' 
												which violations render him 
												liable to be destooled in 
												accordance with Atebubu 
												Customary Law and Usage.&nbsp; An 
												order of destoolment of the 
												Respondent herein Nana Owusu 
												Akyeaw Brempong II as Omanhene 
												of Atebubu&quot;. In all, twelve (12) 
												charges were preferred against 
												the Respondent. On these 
												charges, the Petitioners led 
												evidence and called witnesses in 
												support. They concluded that the 
												Respondent, &quot;does not heed the 
												advice of the kingmakers. He 
												does what pleases him. He has 
												not been observing our custom. 
												The Respondent's behaviour has 
												led to quarrels and tribulations 
												throughout the Atebubu 
												Traditional Area&quot; and must 
												therefore be removed. The 
												Judicial Committee of the 
												Brong-Ahafo Regional House of 
												Chiefs found the 
												Respondent/Appellant herein 
												guilty on two of the charges and 
												ordered his destoolment. The 
												Respondent appealed to the 
												National House of Chiefs which 
												dismissed his appeal and 
												affirmed the decision of the 
												lower tribunal. It is against 
												this decision that this appeal 
												has been brought.- <b>

												As a result of a war between 
												Juaben in Ashanti, and the rest 
												of Ashanti, in or about 1875, 
												the Juabenhene and some of his 
												people migrated to the present 
												Eastern Region, settled in the 
												Koforidua area and created New 
												Juaben. The land acquired by 
												Nana Asafo Agyei, the Omanhene 
												who led his people to New Juaben, 
												included Suhyen, where&nbsp;&nbsp; some of 
												his subjects had settled. In or 
												around 1915, a successor 
												Omanhene of New Juaben, Nana 
												Kwaku Boateng I, while on a tour 
												of Suhyen, appointed an Odikro 
												for the town, purportedly 
												because of its strategic 
												importance as the boundary 
												between the Stool lands of New 
												Juaben and Akyem. This first 
												Odikro, Nana Kwaku Amofa Diatuo, 
												belonged to the Asona Clan. He 
												was succeeded by his maternal 
												brother, Nana Ankam, who, with 
												the permission of the New Juaben 
												Omanhene, blackened the Stool of 
												his predecessor. Thus a black 
												Stool for the ruling family of 
												Suhyen came into being. The 
												position of Odikro continued to 
												be held by the Asona family of 
												Nana Diatuo, until after the 
												reign of Nana Obiri Nyebi, when 
												members of other clans including 
												the Ekuona, Aduana and Agona, 
												began to sit on the Stool.&nbsp; Thus 
												Nana Frimpong Manso I, an Ekuona, 
												occupied the Stool in 1954. The 
												Respondents insist that anytime 
												someone outside the Asona Clan 
												sat on the Stool, he did so with 
												the prior consent or approval of 
												the Asona ruling family. During 
												the reign of Frimpong Manso I, 
												the Omanhene of New Juaben Nana 
												Akrasi elevated the Suhyen 
												Odikro Stool into an Mponua or 
												Divisional Stool. The occupant 
												of the new elevated Stool then 
												created the queen mother Stool, 
												whose first occupant was also an 
												Ekuona. Nana Frimpong Manso I 
												was followed by Frimpong Manso 
												II, also an Ekuona. The dispute 
												that has found its way to this 
												Court arose after the latter was 
												destooled and the Elders 
												embarked on a search for a 
												successor - <b>

												The Osu Stool, the appellant 
												herein purportedly acting 
												through its lawful attorney, Nii 
												Ako Nortei II, the Mankralo of 
												Osu brought an action in the 
												High Court Accra in respect of 
												some Lands in Accra.&nbsp; However, 
												Nii Nortey Owuo III intervened 
												in the said suit by motion 
												praying to be substituted as the 
												sole person who can represent 
												the Osu Stool in that litigation 
												on the ground that he is the Osu 
												Mantse.&nbsp; The High Court 
												dismissed his application.&nbsp; When 
												his application for Review 
												failed he successfully appealed 
												to the Court of Appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
												Mankralo has appealed to this 
												court.
												The Mankralo&#8217;s counsel submits 
												that the 
												applicant/respondent/respondent&#8217;s 
												application for substitution, in 
												his stead, as the sole and 
												proper person to represent the 
												Osu Stool in the aforementioned 
												suit in the High Court was 
												fought on affidavit evidence, 
												which showed that the 
												intervener&#8217;s claim to be the Osu 
												Mantse (Chief of Osu) was 
												challenged by him.&nbsp; In the 
												circumstances, so the argument 
												goes, this was a cause or matter 
												affecting chieftaincy over which 
												the High Court has no 
												jurisdiction to determine On the 
												facts of this case no real or 
												genuine question arose 
												concerning chieftaincy.&nbsp; The 
												intervener attached to his 
												motion, exhibit NNOI from the 
												National Register of Chiefs 
												evidencing his status as the Osu 
												Mantse. The appellant sought to 
												nullify the effect of exhibit 
												NNOI by resort to exhibit JKI 
												and a publication in the Local 
												Government Bulletin No.158 dated 
												15<sup>th</sup> August 1986.&nbsp; 
												Exhibit JKI is a letter from the 
												Greater Accra Regional 
												Administrative Officer, dated 5<sup>th</sup> 
												August 1986 stating inter alia 
												that in accordance with 
												&#8220;Government directive as 
												announced on Friday 1<sup>st</sup> 
												August, 1986 regarding the above 
												subject,&#8221;&nbsp; government had 
												withdrawn recognition from the 
												intervener as Osu Mantse and 
												that all processes leading to 
												the acquisition of his status as 
												a chief had been utterly 
												nullified.&nbsp; In the court of 
												Appeal the appellant&#8217;s counsel 
												fastened on this and with 
												ingenuity contended that as this 
												was an act of the PNDC 
												government the same is rendered 
												inviolable by the transitional 
												provisions of the 1992 
												Constitution - <b>

												- This case started when two 
												contestants were vying to be 
												installed as the queenmother of 
												Asante Mampong. One will be 
												described as the nominee of the 
												first appellant. The other 
												contestant was Nana Yaa Adwubi, 
												the third respondent. The case 
												of the appellants was that first 
												appellant&#8217;s nominee intimated to 
												the Mamponghene, the first 
												respondent, that she was 
												interested in being considered 
												for installation as the 
												queenmother of Asante Mampong. 
												When the nominee&#8217;s supporters 
												realized that the first 
												respondent was bent on 
												nominating the third respondent 
												in preference to her, they filed 
												a petition in the Ashanti 
												Regional House of Chiefs The 
												petition was filed on 22 
												February, 2000. On the next day 
												of 23 February, a motion for 
												injunction was filed to restrain 
												the first and second respondents 
												from installing the third 
												respondent as the queenmother of 
												Mampong. The appellants 
												contended further that 
												notwithstanding the motion, the 
												first and second respondents 
												went ahead and installed the 
												third respondent as the 
												queenmother of Asante Mampong on 
												29 February 2000. On 5<sup>
												</sup>April 2000, they filed a 
												motion in the High Court to 
												attach the three respondents for 
												contempt of the Ashanti Regional 
												House of Chiefs. According to 
												the appellants, the basis of the 
												allegation of contempt was that 
												on 7<sup>th</sup> February 2000 
												there was a meeting of the 
												Mamponghene and the Mampong 
												Traditional Council at which the 
												issue of nomination of the 
												queenmother was discussed: The 
												actual enstoolment was conducted 
												on 29 February 2000 while the 
												petition and motion for 
												injunction were already pending. 
												The enstoolment therefore 
												constituted contempt of the 
												Ashanti Regional House of Chiefs 
												that made the injunction order. 
												The respondents on the other 
												hand contended that on 7<sup>th</sup> 
												February 2000 the nomination and 
												installation took place before 
												the appellants filed their

												Let me now briefly deal with the 
												facts leading to the issuance of 
												the writ of summons.&nbsp; The 
												plaintiff claimed he was the 
												chief (Mantse) of Nungua in the 
												Ga Traditional Council, having 
												been enstooled as such in 1958, 
												to be precise on 25/03/58.&nbsp; 
												However, by an Executive 
												Instrument E. I. already 
												referred to, he was prohibited 
												&#8220;from purporting to exercise the 
												functions of a chief.&#8221;&nbsp; 
												According to him, the reasons 
												for the prohibition as stated in 
												the Instrument were entirely 
												false.&nbsp; :Following the 
												publication of E. I. 18 the 
												plaintiff fled the country and 
												went into exile as he alleged he 
												was persistently harassed by 
												cadres of the then Provisional 
												National Defence Council, 
												Government of the day. He denied 
												he was ever destooled as the 
												&#8220;Mantse&#8221; of Nungua in 1967 as 
												contained in the Instrument, 
												hence the institution of his 
												action against the 
												Attorney-General to challenge 
												the validity of the Executive 
												Instrument. <b>

												</b>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Towards the latter part of the 
												1980's John K. Dolphyne took out 
												a writ of summons at the Sekondi 
												Circuit Court against Speedline 
												Stevedoring Co. Ltd. and S. E. 
												Brenya seeking damages for 
												fraud, and a declaration that he 
												is a member and Director of 
												Speedline Stevedoring Co. Ltd. 
												In the accompanying Statement of 
												Claim, Dolphyne averred that 
												sometime in October 1976, he and 
												three other named persons agreed 
												to established the Speedline 
												Stevedoring Company Ltd (herein 
												after referred to as the 
												Company). They invited Mrs. 
												Brenya to attend a company 
												meeting but she designated her 
												husband, Mr. Brenya to attend 
												instead. At that meeting, Mr. 
												Brenya was appointed company 
												secretary. The four Founders 
												were appointed the company's 
												Directors/Shareholders. He 
												averred further that he paid 
												¢15,000 for the company's 
												licence. The registration of the 
												company was entrusted to Mr. 
												Brenya. It was averred that Mr. 
												Brenya failed to carry out these 
												instructions and rather 
												fraudulently registered the 
												company without the inclusion of 
												Mr. Dolphyne's name as 
												shareholder. Besides he 
												fraudulently put down the names 
												of only himself and his wife as 
												the directors of the company. He 
												Dolphyne, was appointed to 
												oversee the company's operation 
												in Takoradi. It turned out that 
												when he discovered the fraud 
												committed by Mr. Brenya, two of 
												the company's founders namely 
												Messrs Oduro and Arthur made a 
												report to the Registrar General 
												who set up the one man Ntrakwah 
												committee. This committee 
												confirmed Mr. Brenya's fraud. 
												Hence the Circuit Court writ and 
												the reliefs sought. The Circuit 
												Court gave him judgement. There 
												was an appeal to the Court of 
												Appeal, and finally to the 
												Supreme Court, which on 29th 
												January 1997 set aside the 
												reliefs for a director and 
												membership of the company on 
												grounds that a Circuit Court had 
												no jurisdiction to deal in 
												company matters. The Supreme 
												Court however confirmed the 
												damages of ¢3,000,000.00 for 
												fraud. <b>-

												In this judgement the 
												Plaintiff/Appellant/Respondent 
												herein will be referred to as 
												&#8216;the Respondent&#8217;, and the 
												Defendants/Respondents/Appellants 
												will be referred to as &#8216;the 
												Appellants&#8217;. The 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Appellant will also be referred 
												to as &#8216;the Company&#8217;. The brief 
												facts underlying this appeal are 
												that the Company was 
												incorporated sometime in April 
												1991 as a limited liability 
												company with 1,000,000 shares of 
												no par value. Exhibit 1, the 
												Regulations of the Company, 
												shows that the subscribers to 
												the Company were the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Appellant, who subscribed to 
												600,000 shares for which the 
												consideration payable in cash 
												was ¢600,000.00, and Nana Osei 
												Afriyie and the Respondent, each 
												of whom subscribed to 200,000 
												shares for which the 
												consideration payable in cash, 
												in each case, was ¢200,000.00. 
												According to Exhibit 1, the 
												first Directors of the Company 
												were the three subscribers and 
												one D. Patrick Ewusi Sekyi. 
												Sometime after the Company 
												commenced its operations, 
												problems developed between the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Appellant and the Respondent the 
												nub of which was that, whilst 
												the Respondent claimed that he 
												was a fully paid-up member of 
												the Company and entitled to 
												participate in the day to day 
												running of the Company, the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Appellant insisted that the 
												Respondent had not paid for any 
												of his shares. Matters came to a 
												head when, by a letter dated 1<sup>st</sup> 
												November, 1995 (Exhibit Q), the 
												solicitors for the Company 
												informed the Respondent that he 
												(the Respondent) was only a 
												&#8216;nominal shareholder&#8217; of the 
												Company. The letter also 
												purported to offer to the 
												Respondent 20% shares in the 
												Company, in consideration of 
												which he must pay an unspecified 
												sum of money that he was to 
												ascertain by contacting the 
												office of the Managing Director 
												within 14 days, failing which 
												the shares would be offered to 
												someone else. This letter was 
												immediately followed by another 
												communication from the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Appellant, dated 3<sup>rd</sup> 
												November 1995 (Exhibit R), 
												referring to the solicitors&#8217; 
												letter and informing the 
												Respondent that, according to 
												the Company&#8217;s auditor&#8217;s report, 
												the net value of the Company&#8217;s 
												assets was ¢237,051,291.00. The 
												letter also informed the 
												Respondent that, &#8216;as a nominal 
												shareholder&#8217;, he had not paid 
												for his shares and, in order to 
												become a fully-fledged 
												shareholder, he must pay an 
												amount of ¢47,410,258.20, being 
												20% of the current net value of 
												the company&#8217;s assets. The 
												Respondent referred the matter 
												to his solicitors. The record 
												shows further, per Exhibit 3, 
												that on 31<sup>st</sup> October 
												1995, the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Appellant filed at the Companies 
												Registry a form of Notification 
												of Change of Directors which 
												notified the Registrar of 
												Companies of the appointment of 
												5 new Directors. No 
												shareholders&#8217; resolution was 
												exhibited and there is no other 
												evidence that these appointments 
												were made by the shareholders in 
												general meeting, as required by 
												sections 181 and 272 of the Code 
												and regulation 59 of the 
												Company&#8217;s Regulations. - <b>

												The first plaintiff played a 
												leading role in shaping the 
												course of a successful 
												implementation of the second 
												defendant&#8217;s dream of 
												establishing a viable and 
												profitable oxygen-manufacturing 
												plant in Ghana.&nbsp; The first 
												plaintiff and the two other 
												plaintiffs made contributions 
												towards the setting up of the 
												defendants&#8217; oxygen production 
												business upon an understanding, 
												reached with the second 
												defendant, that forty percent of 
												the shares in the first 
												defendant company would be 
												allocated to the plaintiffs.&nbsp; 
												The second defendant admitted in 
												his pleadings that he was the 
												Managing-Director, Governor and 
												Financial Controller of the 
												first defendant.&nbsp; The defendants 
												had, however, failed to honour 
												the agreement concluded with the 
												plaintiffs. &#8220;It is my opinion 
												therefore that there was a valid 
												agreement between the plaintiffs 
												and the defendants whereby the 
												plaintiffs rendered services and 
												provided monies towards the 
												setting up of the oxygen 
												manufacturing plant in 
												expectation of allocation to 
												them of forty per cent shares in 
												the first defendant company.&nbsp; 
												Failure by the second defendant 
												to allocate forty per cent 
												shares to the plaintiffs would 
												therefore amount to breach of

												Company Law &#8211; Director &#8211; Removal 
												- </span></b>
												<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">
												The Statement of Claim filed 
												with the writ was, with the 
												leave of the learned trial judge 
												granted on 25<sup>th</sup> 
												February, 1993, amended.&nbsp; The 
												amended Statement of Claim 
												admitted that the Defendant was 
												until 13<sup>th</sup> September 
												1991 a director of the first 
												Plaintiff.&nbsp; It, however, averred 
												that on or about 31<sup>st</sup> 
												July 1991, the second plaintiff 
												set in motion a process which 
												led to the convening of an 
												Extraordinary General Meeting of 
												all the Directors and members of 
												the first Plaintiff for 13<sup>th</sup> 
												September 1991.&nbsp; The Statement 
												of Claim asserted that on or 
												about 13<sup>th</sup> September 
												1991, an Extraordinary General 
												Meeting of the first Plaintiff 
												took place at which the 
												Defendant was removed as a 
												Director of the first 
												Plaintiff.&nbsp; The Plaintiffs 
												averred that on or about 30<sup>th</sup> 
												September 1991, they instructed 
												their solicitor to demand from 
												the Defendant all properties of 
												the first Plaintiff in his 
												possession and to warn him to 
												desist from holding himself out 
												as a director of the first 
												Plaintiff.&nbsp; The Defendant, in 
												response, wrote to the 
												Plaintiffs&#8217; solicitor 
												challenging the basis of the 
												instructions given by the 
												Plaintiffs and refusing to 
												comply with the instructions.&nbsp; 
												Finally, the Plaintiffs pleaded 
												that the Defendant had exerted 
												undue influence over the second 
												plaintiff to sign documents in 
												his favour and that he had 
												committed various fraudulent 
												acts as a director of the first 
												Plaintiff. In response to the 
												Plaintiffs&#8217; averments, the 
												Defendant&#8217;s defence was that he 
												remained a director of the first 
												Plaintiff and that he had never 
												been validly removed as a 
												director in accordance with 
												section 185(2) of the Companies 
												Code 1963 (Act 179).&nbsp; He also 
												averred that share certificates 
												evidencing his ownership of 
												shares in the first Plaintiff 
												had been issued to him.&nbsp; He 
												counterclaimed that &#8220;by a power 
												of attorney dated 7<sup>th</sup> 
												April 1986 he was mandated to 
												run the affairs of 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Plaintiffs as acting Managing 
												Director since 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Plaintiff is old and weak and 
												could not manage the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Plaintiffs.&#8221;&nbsp; He averred that by 
												virtue of the powers vested in 
												him, he managed the affairs of 
												the first Plaintiff from 1<sup>st</sup> 
												June 1986 up to 31<sup>st</sup> 
												October 1991, as Managing

												Contract &#8211; Agreement &#8211; Breach - 
												&nbsp;</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial">The 
												gist of the case for the 
												plaintiff was that it agreed to 
												give its piling hammer and an 
												Audi saloon car in exchange of 
												the defendant&#8217;s Toyota Hilux 
												pick-up and crushing machine.&nbsp; 
												Whereas it honoured its 
												obligation and delivered the 
												equipment to the defendant, the 
												latter failed to deliver the 
												crushing machine to the 
												plaintiff. The plaintiff 
												thereafter wrote to levy charges 
												for the use of the piling 
												hammer. On the other hand, the 
												defendant denied there was any 
												agreement to hire the equipment 
												and asserted it was only an 
												agreement to swap them for each 
												other. The defendant therefore 
												denied liability and rejected 
												invoices the plaintiff submitted 
												for payment, for the reason that 
												it made the piling hammer 
												available for collection by the 
												plaintiff, but it (plaintiff) 
												refused or failed to go for it. 
												The trial judge found in his 
												judgment there was a contract of 
												hiring equipment by the parties 
												which, the defendant breached 
												and proceeded to award damages 
												for the plaintiff.&nbsp; He also 
												ordered the defendant to deliver 
												the piling hammer to the 
												plaintiff at its premises or pay 
												for the cost of the plaintiff 
												retrieving it itself, awarded 
												$300.00 (or its equivalent) per 
												day chargeable from 18<sup>th</sup>

												- The brief facts in this matter 
												are that the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Plaintiff (suing by one Sarah 
												Chinebuah who describes herself 
												as his lawful attorney) is the 
												son of the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Plaintiff. The 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Plaintiff was at all material 
												times normally resident in the 
												United States of America and his 
												declared intention was to 
												purchase the property for the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Plaintiff. Sometime in or about 
												January 1989, the Plaintiffs 
												expressed to the Defendant an 
												interest in purchasing the 
												property and commenced 
												negotiations with her. According 
												to the Plaintiffs&#8217; pleadings, 
												the negotiations resulted in an 
												agreement that the purchase 
												price would be ¢19,000,000.00. 
												According to the Defendant, 
												however, there was a tentatively 
												agreed price of ¢22,000,000.00 
												(now GH¢2,200.00), the final 
												price being subject to the 
												outcome of a valuation to be 
												conducted. The agreement was 
												never reduced into writing and, 
												whatever the agreed price, the 
												understanding was that the same 
												would be completely paid by May 
												1989. In April 1989, however, 
												the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff 
												sent to the Defendant a tape 
												recorded message informing her 
												that, owing to the outbreak of 
												the Gulf War, he was unable to 
												complete the payment of the 
												purchase price as promised and 
												he then put the Defendant to her 
												option of either selling the 
												property to any other person or 
												waiting till the end of the said 
												war when the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Plaintiff would be able to remit 
												the money. As it transpired, 
												although the Defendant did not 
												communicate to the Plaintiffs 
												any particular choice, she did 
												not sell the property to any 
												other person and when, in July 
												1991 the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Plaintiff, through the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Plaintiff, commenced paying 
												various amounts to the Defendant 
												she accepted such payments. 
												These payments continued, 
												sporadically, until December 
												1993; by which time, as admitted 
												by the Defendant, a total amount 
												of ¢19,000,000.00 had been 
												received from the 1<sup>st</sup>

												Contract Oral - Specific

												</span></b>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In July, 1977 the Respondent 
												company purchased from the 
												Appellant company an IBM Copier 
												II Machine for an amount of 
												¢33,000.00. That same month the 
												Appellant company installed the 
												machine for the Respondents in 
												Cape Coast. It is quite clear 
												that up to about 1984 the 
												engineers of the Appellant 
												company serviced the said 
												machine for the Respondents, but 
												thereafter the Appellants 
												declined to do any further 
												servicing. The Respondents claim 
												that when the machine broke down 
												again in February, 1986 they 
												made several demands on the 
												Appellants to effect the 
												necessary repairs but the 
												Appellants wrongfully refused to 
												do the repairs which resulted in 
												the Respondents' inability to 
												function in their business. They 
												claimed they suffered loss. 
												Accordingly, on 17th March, 1987 
												the Respondents sued the 
												Appellants at the High Court&nbsp; 
												The Respondent took pains to set 
												out in their statement of claim 
												various particulars of the 
												alleged oral agreement. I need 
												to set out two paragraphs of the 
												statement of claim in order to 
												make for a clear appreciation of 
												the basis of the Respondents' 
												claims. The Appellants denied 
												having made any oral agreement 
												with the Respondents; they 
												claimed that the Respondents 
												declined to enter into a 
												maintenance service agreement 
												with the Appellants and insisted 
												that whatever maintenance 
												service they rendered to the 
												Respondents was on a case by 
												case basis under a scheme 
												described as &quot;On Call Basis&quot; 
												which did not create any 
												standing contract binding the 
												Appellants. In effect the 
												Appellants claimed that they 
												were not bound by any contract 
												which the Respondents could call 
												upon them to specifically 
												perform.<font color="#FF0000">

												The Defendant/Appellant,(Appellant 
												herein) a contractor, was 
												awarded a contract by Ghana 
												Telecom to build Payphone 
												Shelters and Telephone Stand 
												structures in the Wa District. 
												As the Appellant&#8217;s company was 
												cash strapped he approached the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent, 
												(Respondent herein) to assist 
												him financially to execute the 
												contract. The Appellant made a 
												statutory declaration to jointly 
												execute the contract and share 
												the profit from the contract 
												sum. The Appellant claims in 
												Paragraph 4 of his statement of 
												defence that the statutory 
												declaration was between 
												Franksali Enterprise Ltd of 
												which the Appellant is the 
												Managing Director and the 
												Respondent.Upon completion of 
												the contract a total sum of 
												¢137,286,033.50 was paid to the 
												Appellant Company. The 
												Respondent claimed he alone 
												financed the entire project to 
												the tune of 
												¢107,627,000[Paragraph 8 and 9 
												of the Statement of claim] and 
												this was denied by the Appellant 
												[Paragraph 8 of the statement of 
												defence]. The Appellant stated 
												that the Respondent informed one 
												Mr. Ibrahim Sefa that he spent 
												an amount of ¢95,000,000 on the 
												execution of the project. 
												Despite the respondents refusal 
												to give receipts to the 
												Appellants to show how much he, 
												Respondent, actually spent the 
												appellant paid an amount of 
												¢94,074,631 to the Respondent.On 
												the appellant&#8217;s failure to pay 
												what the respondent deemed to be 
												due him on the agreement he 
												brought an action at the High 
												Court claiming a number of 
												reliefs.&nbsp; After the appellant 
												had entered appearance and filed 
												a defence&nbsp; the Respondent 
												applied for summary judgment 
												claiming the Appellant had no 
												defence to the action. To the 
												affidavit supporting the 
												application for summary judgment 
												was annexed a document titled 
												CONTRACT/AGREEMENT in which the 
												defendant was admitting 
												liability and promising to pay 
												certain sums of money within a 
												certain period. The application 
												for summary judgment was 
												granted. The appellant&#8217;s appeal 
												to the Court of Appeal against

												The facts of the case may 
												briefly be stated as follows: On 
												21 February 2002, the President 
												of the Republic wrote to the 
												Speaker of Parliament, informing 
												the Speaker that the President 
												would be travelling to Australia 
												to attend the Commonwealth Heads 
												of Government Meeting, scheduled 
												to take place from 2 to 5 March 
												2002 and that he would be away 
												from Ghana from 24 February 
												until 10 March.&nbsp; He further 
												informed the Speaker that during 
												that period, because the 
												Vice-President would also be 
												absent from the country from the 
												24 to 27 February, the Speaker 
												was, pursuant to article 60(11) 
												of the Constitution, to act as 
												President for those four days.&nbsp; 
												Accordingly, on 24 February, the 
												Speaker swore the Presidential 
												oath and acted for the President 
												from the 24 to 27 February.&nbsp;On 
												28 February, the plaintiff, in 
												his capacity as &#8220;a concerned, 
												private Ghanaian citizen, who is 
												interested in upholding the 
												respect for, and compliance 
												with, the Constitution and the 
												rule of law&#8221;, as he declares in 
												his writ, filed a writ at the 
												Supreme Court, invoking the 
												original jurisdiction of the 
												court and seeking the following 
												reliefs:A declaration that upon 
												a true and proper interpretation 
												of article 60(11) of the 1992 
												Constitution, the purported 
												swearing-in of the Speaker of 
												Parliament, the Right&nbsp;Honourable 
												Mr Peter Ala Adjetey, as 
												President of Ghana, on or about 
												Monday 24 February 2002, is 
												inconsistent with, or is in 
												contravention of the said

												Constitution - Interpretation of

												- On&nbsp; 15th July,&nbsp; 1997, 
												Constable Yebbi and Cpl. Avalifo 
												were arraigned before the 
												Greater Accra Regional Tribunal 
												on charges of conspiracy to 
												steal and stealing 
												¢100,000,000.00 contrary to 
												section 23(1) and 124(1)&nbsp; 
												respectively of the Criminal 
												Code 1960 (Act 29). The money is 
												said to belong to the National 
												Democratic Congress (NDC), a 
												political party registered under 
												the Political Parties 
												Registration Law 1992, (PNDCL 
												281). In the course of the trial 
												the accused challenged the 
												jurisdiction of the tribunal. 
												They pointed out that under 
												Article 143(1) of the 1992 
												Constitution, a regional 
												tribunal has jurisdiction to try 
												such offences against the state 
												and public interest as 
												Parliament may by law prescribe. 
												But the offences they were 
												facing could not be said to be 
												against the state or public 
												interest since the money 
												involved was admitted to belong 
												to a political party which 
												obviously is not a state 
												institution, neither is the 
												theft of a political party's 
												money, an offence against public 
												interest. A Regional Tribunal 
												can therefore not try such an 
												offence. The prosecution sought 
												to resist the objection by 
												contending that once Parliament 
												has exercised its discretion by 
												enacting in the Court's Act 1993 
												(Act 459) section 24(1) thereof, 
												that a regional tribunal has 
												jurisdiction in all criminal 
												matters, it follows that the 
												tribunal was seised with 
												jurisdiction in the matter. But 
												the accused in reply submitted 
												that section 24(1) of Act 459 is 
												not consistent with Article 
												143(1) of the 1992 Constitution 
												and consequently null and void. 
												The trial Regional Tribunal 
												accordingly referred the 
												following issues to this court

												August 2006, the Registrar of

												The Plaintiff&#8217;s case is simply 
												that under the 1992 
												constitutional arrangement on 
												finance, there are two broad 
												ways in which moneys can be 
												withdrawn from the consolidated 
												fund as provided under article 
												178 (1), the first being 
												expenditure that is charged on 
												the fund by either&nbsp; the 
												constitution or by an Act of 
												Parliament.&nbsp; On this premise, 
												his argument is that 
												parliamentary approval is not 
												required for payments 
												specifically charged to the 
												consolidated fund as provided 
												under the articles 178 (1) (a) 
												and 187 (14).&nbsp; Furthermore, he 
												contends that, since by virtue 
												of article 187 (14), the 
												administrative expenses of the 
												office&nbsp; Auditor- General, 
												including all salaries, 
												allowances, gratuities and 
												pensions payable to and in 
												respect of persons serving in 
												the audit service is a direct 
												charge on the consolidated fund, 
												when the Audit Service Board, 
												acting in consultation with the 
												Public Services Commission as is 
												mandated under article 189 (3), 
												determines the terms and 
												conditions of its serving 
												officers and employees, these 
												become automatically due for 
												implementation on the effective 
												date(s) and no person or 
												authority has power to vary any 
												part of the conditions of 
												service so determined. Even more 
												forcefully, he urged that in 
												terms of article 179(2), once 
												the administrative expenses of 
												the Service, have been 
												determined in compliance with 
												articles 189 (1), (2) and (3) of 
												the 1992 constitution, the 
												payment of these estimates are 
												not in any way subject to a 
												downward review by the executive

												<b>Committee of investigation</b> 
												- The brief facts of this case 
												are that the Plaintiff was 
												appointed as Deputy Chairman of 
												the National Commission on Civic 
												Education (NCCE), by the 
												President in accordance with 
												Article 232(2) of the 1992 
												Constitution on the 6th July 
												1993 till 28th August 1999 when 
												he was removed from office in 
												accordance with Articles 236 and 
												146 of the Constitution. Under 
												Article 236 the procedure for 
												the removal of the Deputy 
												chairman of NCCE shall be the 
												same as provided for the removal 
												of a Justice of the High Court 
												under Article 146(1) which says 
												&quot;A Justice of the Superior Court 
												or a chairman of the Regional 
												Tribunal shall not be removed 
												from office except for stated 
												misbehaviour or incompetence or 
												on ground of inability to 
												perform the functions of his 
												office arising from infirmity of 
												body or mind&quot;.The procedure 
												provided for the removal of a 
												High Court Judge was that when 
												the President receives a 
												petition for the removal of a 
												High Court Judge or Chairman of 
												a Regional Tribunal he refer 
												same to the Chief Justice whose 
												duty it is to determine whether 
												there is a prima facie case or 
												not.If there is, the Chief 
												Justice is empowered to set up a 
												Committee to investigate the 
												allegation of 'stated 
												misbehaviour' against the person 
												accused and then, if proved, to 
												make final recommendation to the 
												Chief Justice who would then 
												forward same to the President. 
												In this case the President 
												received a petition containing 
												complaints of stated 
												misbehaviours against the 
												Plaintiff and consequently the 
												requisite procedure referred to 
												above was set in motion. The 
												Justice George Acquah Committee 
												i.e. 2nd Defendant herein, was 
												appointed which investigated the 
												alleged stated misbehaviour and 
												thereafter made findings of fact 
												and recommendations to the 
												President on account of which 
												the Plaintiff was removed from 
												office. <b>-

												<b>Law - Article 145(2)(b) - 
												Maximum age for High Court 
												Judges - </b>The Applicant is 
												asking us for two reliefs, 
												either cumulatively or in the 
												alternative. In either case, the 
												result will be to disqualify Mr 
												Justice D. K. Afreh, Justice of 
												the Supreme Court, from sitting 
												as an Additional Judge of the 
												High Court. In seeking to 
												disqualify Mr Justice Afreh, the 
												Applicant argues that on a 
												proper reading of Article 
												145(2)(b) of the Constitution, 
												he is not competent to sit in 
												the High Court because he has 
												passed the age of 65 which is 
												the prescribed maximum age for 
												High Court Judges.The Applicant 
												also argues that, in any event, 
												having attained the age of 70 
												years in March, Mr Justice Afreh 
												cannot continue to sit in any 
												Court except for a six month 
												period to complete cases which 
												had been commenced before him 
												pursuant to Article 145(2) of 
												the Constitution. In support of 
												this second ground, the 
												Applicant says that, although Mr 
												Justice Afreh had dealt with 
												some interlocutory matters in 
												their case, the proceedings had 
												not actually commenced before 
												him within the intendment of 
												Article 145(4) of the 
												Constitution. As regards Mr 
												Justice Afreh&quot;s capacity to sit 
												as an Additional Judge of the 
												High Court, the Applicant's 
												contention is that, Article 
												145(2)(b) squarely catches him 
												and disqualifies him. We are 
												accordingly urged to read 
												Article 145(2)(b) of the 
												Constitution. In our opinion, 
												Article 145(2)(b) of our 
												Constitution is unambiguous and 
												allows for no argument. It 
												expressly states that a Judge of 
												the High Court must retire on 
												attainment of 65 years of age. 
												It means that a High Court Judge 
												must vacate his office upon 
												attainment of 65 years, 
												otherwise, excepting for the 
												grace period of six months to 
												wind up cases by virtue of 
												Article 145(4), anything done by 
												him thereafter is a nullity. It 
												also implies that a person who 
												is 65 years or older cannot be 
												appointed to the office of Judge 
												of the High Court. Therefore, 
												the Applicant extrapolates from 
												these valid premises to contend 
												that, as Mr Justice Afreh had 
												attained the age of 65, his 
												designation as an Additional 
												Judge of the High Court by the 
												Chief Justice is in 
												contravention of a clear and 
												undebatable provision of the 
												Constitution, to wit Article 
												145(2)(b) thereof. The logic of 
												the Applicant's position is 
												that, if Mr Justice Afreh was 
												not qualified to hold the office 
												of a High Court Judge by reason 
												of his age, the Chief Justice 
												cannot appoint him as an 
												Additional Judge of the High 
												Court where he is 
												constitutionally prohibited from 
												sitting. We agree with the 
												Applicant that if Mr Justice 
												Afreh is disqualified from 
												sitting in the High Court, the 
												Chief Justice or the President 
												of the Republic of Ghana must 
												not be allowed to circumvent the 
												Constitution by installing him 
												there under a different guise. 
												The maxim of the law is what 
												Coke stated ages ago that quando 
												a liquid prohibetur fieri ex 
												dirceto prohibetur et obliquum: 
												when a thing is prohibited, it 
												cannot be done either directly 
												or indirectly with the purpose 
												of achieving the prohibited 
												result. The maxim applies even 
												more forcefully when the 
												prohibition is mandated by the 
												Constitution. The Constitution 
												is the fundamental law of the 
												land and every authority is 
												bound by its explicit 
												provisions, such as Article 
												145(2)(b). Therefore, the 
												question is whether the 
												designation of Mr Justice Afreh, 
												who is admittedly over 65 years 
												old, to sit as an Additional 
												Judge of the High Court, is an 
												attempt to circumvent the age 
												restriction imposed on High 
												Court Judges. If it is such an 
												attempt to do directly or 
												indirectly what the Constitution 
												forbids, we must declare it to 
												be unconstitutional and accede 
												to the Applicant's prayer by 
												issuing an order of prohibition 
												to stop him from so sitting.- <b>

												This is an appeal from the 
												decision of the Court of Appeal, 
												affirming the decision of the 
												High Court. The appeal was heard 
												and adjourned to 31st March, 
												2000 for judgment. The court 
												realised later that a legal 
												point which had been raised when 
												an application for stay of 
												execution was brought and which 
												legal issue had more or less 
												influenced the granting of an 
												order of stay of execution, had 
												not been repeated in the 
												subsequent submissions made 
												during the hearing of the 
												substantive appeal by either 
												party. Since we considered that 
												issue to be fundamental to the 
												resolution of the appeal, we 
												gave the parties reasonable 
												opportunity to be heard under 
												Rule 6(8) of the Supreme Court 
												Rules, 1996 (C.I. 16). Counsel 
												for the parties have accordingly 
												submitted their argument for 
												consideration in the appeal.Her 
												Lordship Miss Justice Aryee, 
												from the official records of the 
												Judicial Service, retired from 
												the Service on 12th September, 
												1992.Article 145(2) of the 
												Constitution provides,(2)&nbsp; A 
												Justice of a Superior Court or a 
												Chairman of a Regional Tribunal 
												shall vacate his office (a)&nbsp;&nbsp; in 
												the case of a Justice of the 
												Supreme Court or the Court of 
												Appeal, on attaining the age of 
												seventy years; or(b)&nbsp; in the 
												case of a Justice of the High 
												Court or a Chairman of a 
												Regional Tribunal, on attaining 
												the age of sixty-five years; 
												or(c)&nbsp; upon his removal from 
												office in accordance with 
												article 146 of this 
												Constitution&quot;.Sub-clause (4) of 
												this article however, provides 
												that&#8212;&quot;(4)&nbsp; Notwithstanding that 
												he has attained the age at which 
												he is required by this article 
												to vacate his office, a person 
												holding office as a Justice of a 
												Superior Court or Chairman of a 
												Regional Tribunal may continue 
												in office for a period not 
												exceeding six months after 
												attaining that age, as may be 
												necessary to enable him to 
												deliver judgment or do any other 
												thing in relation to proceedings 
												that were commenced before him 
												previous to his attaining that 
												age&quot; (emphasis supplied).This 
												provision allows a retired 
												Superior Court judge who 
												otherwise would have retired at 
												the compulsory retiring age, to 
												continue in office for a period 
												not exceeding six months as may 
												be necessary for him to deliver 
												judgment or do any other thing 
												in relation to proceedings that 
												commenced before him previous to 
												his attaining that age. It is 
												not the intention of the framers 
												of the Constitution that the 
												retiring judge should 
												automatically continue for the 
												maximum period of six months; 
												the retiring judge may be given 
												less than the six months but any 
												period given him shall not 
												exceed six months.The evidence 
												before us shows that the 
												judgment of the High Court was 
												delivered outside the 
												constitutionally permissive 
												period, albeit by another judge 
												who was a sitting judge. Outside 
												the six months period no judge 
												had jurisdiction to deliver the 
												judgment on behalf of the 
												retired judge. Since the 
												judgment was delivered about two 
												years after the judge had 
												retired, the proceedings after 
												the six months period were a 
												nullity: delivering that 
												judgment by a sitting judge 
												could not validate the otherwise 
												unlawful proceedings. 
												Accordingly, we would allow the 
												appeal and set aside the 
												judgment of both the Court of 
												Appeal and the High Court 
												together with all costs awarded, 
												if any. We would order that the 
												case be remitted to the High 
												Court to be expeditiously tried 
												de novo. <b>

												in the Supreme Court by articles 
												2(1) and 130(1) of the 1992 
												Constitution to interpret and 
												enforce the provisions of the 
												Constitution, is a special 
												jurisdiction meant to be invoked 
												in suits raising genuine or real 
												issues of the interpretation of 
												a provision of the Constitution 
												or&nbsp; the enforcement of a 
												provision of the Constitution, 
												ora question whether an 
												enactment was made ultra vires 
												Parliament, or any other 
												authority or person by law or 
												under the constitution. This 
												special jurisdiction is not 
												meant to usurp, or to be 
												resorted to in place of, any of 
												the jurisdictions of a lower 
												court. In other words, where our 
												said jurisdiction has been 
												invoked in an action which 
												properly falls within a 
												particular course of action at a 
												lower court, this court shall 
												refuse to assume jurisdiction in 
												that action, notwithstanding the 
												fact that it has been presented 
												as an interpretation and/or 
												enforcement suit. For a large 
												number of actions which fall 
												within specific causes of action 
												can be presented in the form of 
												interpretation and/or 
												enforcement actions. For 
												example, if someone goes to farm 
												or commences building on another 
												person&#8217;s land, the latter can 
												file a suit at the Supreme Court 
												invoking its original 
												jurisdiction for a declaration 
												that the said entry unto his 
												land, constitutes an invasion of 
												his right to his property under 
												article 18 of the 1992 
												Constitution, damages for such 
												violation, and an order to 
												recover his property.&nbsp; But it is

												Articles 2 (1) (b) and 130 of 
												the 1992 Constitution as well as 
												under Rule 45 of the Supreme 
												Court rules 1996 (C.I. 16) by 
												filing an affidavit verifying 
												facts and particulars and 
												statement of plaintiffs case on 
												the 14/9/99 without a Writ.&nbsp; On 
												the 30/9/99 he filed a Writ 
												together with a Supplementary 
												Affidavit in which he stated in 
												Par 2 - 4 thereof as follows: 
												That on the 14th day of 
												September 1999 I filed an 
												Affidavit Verifying Facts and 
												Particulars, together with 
												Statement of Plaintiffs case but 
												inadvertently did not attach the 
												Writ to it. At the hearing the 
												Defendants raised a preliminary 
												objection to the Plaintiffs 
												action and applied for same to 
												be struck out on the ground that 
												the Plaintiff did not initiate 
												any action as required under by 
												the mandatory provision of Rule 
												45 (1) C.I. 16. &#8220;Except as 
												otherwise provided in these 
												Rules, an action brought to

												of this Court shall be commenced 
												by a writ in the form 27 set out 
												in Part III of the Schedule to 
												these Rules which shall be 
												signed by the Plaintiff or his 
												Counsel &#8221;The above requirements 
												were not complied with and 
												therefore no action having been 
												initiated by a Writ the other 
												documents filed on 14/9/99 were 
												of no consequence and null and 
												void. The Plaintiff&#8217;s request in 
												the Supplementary Affidavit 
												filed on 30/9/99, that the said 
												invalid documents to attached to 
												the Writ filed on 30/9/99 is 
												misconceived. It is not for the 
												Registrar of this Court to 
												rectify any lapses in the filing 
												of papers for parties who fail 
												to comply with Rules of 
												procedure nor has been given any 
												power to do so.&nbsp; Neither can

												Constitutional Law - Removal of 
												Judicial office - Chief justice 
												- </span></b>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The events which have provoked 
												this action may be stated as 
												follows: By a letter from the 
												office of the President, dated 
												20th March, 2000 and addressed 
												to the Plaintiff, the plaintiff 
												was informed as follows: H.E. 
												the President has accepted the 
												recommendation of the Judicial 
												Council, given in accordance 
												with L.I.319, Section 28(2) of 
												the Judicial Service 
												Regulations, 1963 and has 
												directed your immediate 
												redeployment out the Judicial 
												Service for displaying a high 
												degree of incompetence in the 
												discharge of your duties&#8221;. By 
												his writ herein, the Plaintiff 
												seeks from this Court a 
												declaration that his removal 
												from the Judicial Service as a 
												Judicial Officer by the 
												President, for the reasons 
												stated, is contrary to Article 
												151(1) of the Constitution.&nbsp; In 
												his Statement of Case in support 
												of his claim, the Plaintiff, who 
												until the said letter held the 
												position of 2nd Deputy Judicial 
												Secretary, contended that: a. 
												The effect of the President&#8217;s 
												letter was to remove him from 
												his judicial office b. Such 
												removal was in punishment for 
												allegations made against him and 
												which he was not given any 
												opportunity to be heard in his 
												defence, contrary to Section 25 
												of the Judicial Service Act&nbsp; c. 
												Since the coming into force of 
												the Constitution, the provisions 
												of Regulation 28(2) of the 
												Judicial Service Regulations 
												either ceased to apply for the 
												purposes of removing a judicial 
												officer, or its application must 
												be with such modifications as 
												are necessary to bring those 
												provisions in conformity with 
												Article 151 of the Constitution 
												d. By virtue of Article 151, it 
												is only the Chief justice who 
												has the power to remove a 
												Judicial Officer from office and 
												such removal may only be upon 
												the grounds and pursuant to the 
												process stipulated therein. The 
												Honourable Attorney-General, in 
												his Statement of Case, contended 
												that the holding of the position 
												of 2nd Deputy Judicial secretary 
												did not make the Plaintiff a 
												Judicial Officer, since the 
												position of a Judicial Officer 
												is a creature of the law and is 
												one which cannot be created 
												outside Article 161 of the 
												Constitution of Section 32 of 
												the Judicial Service Act.&nbsp; - <b>

                                                Constitution, the

                                                compulsory retiring age which is 
                                                comparable to that of a Justice

                                                the 1992 Constitution omits to 
                                                state the exact retiring age of 
                                                the Auditor &#8211;General, whereas

                                                same class have had &nbsp;their 
                                                constitutionally compulsory 
                                                retiring ages pegged to that of

                                                It was urged that the correct 
                                                constitutional &nbsp;position in 
                                                context, is that on a true and 
                                                proper construction of the 
                                                constitutional provisions

                                                age seventy. The corollary 
                                                argument is that the s. 10 of 
                                                the &nbsp;Audit Service Act 2000 (Act 
                                                528), which sets the retiring 
                                                age at 60, basing itself on 
                                                articles 190, 195, and 199 is 
                                                clearly inconsistent with the 
                                                constitution, void to the extent 
                                                of the inconsistency, and the 
                                                same must be struck down. -

												This is a motion invoking the&nbsp; 
												supervisory jurisdiction of the 
												Supreme Court, under Article 132 
												of the Constitution for the 
												Order of Certiorari directed to 
												the High Court Accra to quash 
												its judgment given on 25th 
												January 2002 in Suit 
												No.C398/7.The ground for this 
												application is that:&#8220;The 
												judgment is null and void 
												because at the time it was 
												given&nbsp; the six week period 
												prescribed by the rules for it 
												to be delivered had elapsed.&#8221;The 
												facts are that the present 
												applicant was Defendant in the 
												High Court case Suit No. 
												C898/97. The plaintiff therein 
												instituted an action against the 
												applicant seeking the following 
												reliefs:&#8212;a) The export value of 
												sea food assessed at 
												FF.88,318,50 or its equivalent 
												.b) Interest at the commercial 
												bank lending rate calculated&nbsp; 
												from the date of 1st demand 
												until the date of payment and c) 
												Damages for breach of contract. 
												After the hearing of evidence 
												in&nbsp; the case had been completed, 
												the plaintiff filed its address 
												on 8th December 1999 and 
												Defendant also filed its address 
												on 28th January 2000. The case 
												was then adjourned for judgment 
												by the trial High Court which 
												was eventually delivered on the 
												25th January 2002 in favour of 
												the Plaintiff for all the 
												reliefs sought. According to the 
												applicant since the judgment was 
												delivered almost 2 years after 
												the&nbsp; close of the case in the 
												High Court, instead of the 
												stipulated 6 weeks as contained&nbsp; 
												in Order 63 (2A) of L.N. 140A as 
												amended by L.I 1107 the judgment 
												is null and void and ought to be 
												so declared and quashed by 
												certiorari. The relevant rule 
												relied on is L.I 1107 which 
												amends&nbsp; Order 63 by adding rule 
												2A to Order 63 as contained in 
												the High Court (Civil Procedure) 
												(Amendment) Rules 1977 L.I 
												1107.- <b>

                                                The plaintiff&#8217;s response to this 
                                                application was to argue that 
                                                section 30 of Act 32 was 
                                                inconsistent with Article 17(1) 
                                                of the 1992 Constitution and 
                                                therefore not binding.&nbsp; It was 
                                                as a result of this argument

												According to the Applicants, 
												they are registered members of a 
												company limited by guarantee 
												called the Kejetia Traders 
												Association, also known as 
												Mighty 18. The 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Respondent is the Chairman of 
												the Association. Sometime in 
												1993, the Kumasi Metropolitan 
												Assembly (KMA) ordered the 
												members of the Association, who 
												were legitimately carrying on 
												their business in Kejetia to 
												quit their place of business as 
												the Government of Ghana wanted 
												to redesign and develop the 
												area. Consequently, the 
												Association in collaboration 
												with the KMA managed to secure a 
												commercial property belonging to 
												the State Housing Corporation at 
												North Suntreso, Kumasi, for the 
												construction of stores. It was 
												agreed that the construction 
												would be pre-financed by members 
												of the Association who were 
												interested in acquiring the 
												stores by paying the sum of Two 
												Million One Hundred Thousand 
												cedis each at the time.
												For one reason or the other, the 
												KMA was unable to meet its part 
												of the bargain to allocate the 
												stores to the members of the 
												Association which resulted in 
												the successful institution of a 
												suit against the KMA. The KMA 
												was compelled by an order of 
												specific performance to allocate 
												the stores to the paid up 
												members of the Association whose 
												names were contained in a list 
												prepared by the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Respondent, then the Plaintiff 
												in that matter. Some members of 
												the Association who had taken 
												possession of some of the stores 
												but it was alleged had not 
												contributed towards its 
												construction were ejected by the 
												orders of the court. Feeling 
												aggrieved by this decision, the 
												Applicants herein instituted 
												another suit in the High Court 
												Kumasi against the Chairman of 
												the Association. They were 
												successful in that attempt but 
												it was overturned on Appeal in 
												the Court of Appeal. The 
												Applicants armed with their 
												victory in the High Court had in 
												the mean time taken possession 
												and occupation of twenty-eight 
												of the forty four stores whilst 
												the matter was on Appeal. Not 
												long afterwards, the Government 
												of Ghana compulsorily acquired 
												the property on which the block 
												of stores was situate to allow 
												for the construction of the 
												Sunyani-Kumasi road.The 
												Association was duly compensated 
												for the acquisition in the sum 
												of GH¢392,062.90, which cheque 
												was drawn up in the name of the 
												Association and by an order of 
												the High Court deposited at the 
												Kumasi Central Branch of the 
												National Investment Bank, 
												pending the outcome of the 
												Appeal.On the 22<sup>nd</sup> of 
												May 2008, the Court of Appeal 
												gave judgment in favour of the 1<sup>st</sup>

												proceeded to go into execution 
												by filing an entry of Judgment. </span>

												for the hire or purchase of a

												had been declared redundant as a 
												result of a manpower 
												rationalization exercise by the 
												company.&nbsp; The letter stated that 
												his services would no longer be 
												required from 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												December 1996, but that he would 
												be paid up to that day and also 
												be paid three months salary in 
												lieu of notice.&nbsp; The letter 
												further informed him that he 
												would receive a severance award 
												of two and a half months pay for 
												each year of service, commencing 
												from 1<sup>st</sup> January 
												1991.At the meeting with the

												</b>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Appellant who carries on 
												business in Ghana as civil 
												engineers had secured a contract 
												from Glahco Hotels &amp; Tourism 
												Development Co. Ltd, owners of 
												the Golden Tulip Hotel, to do 
												civil engineering works in the 
												new Executive Wing of the hotel. 
												Their contract permitted 
												subcontracting. The Respondents 
												are renowned refrigeration 
												engineers. They are based in 
												Cyprus. The Appellants invited 
												them to be Sub-Contractors, for 
												the supply, engineering and 
												installation of a Heating 
												Ventilation and Air-Conditioning 
												System (HVAC) in the Executive 
												Wing of the Hotel.Between May 
												and November 1996, discussions 
												took place between the 
												Appellants and the Respondents 
												about the subcontract, but 
												nothing concrete materialised 
												from those discussions. The 
												Appellants themselves signed 
												their agreement with Glahco 
												Hotels, etc, in September 1996. 
												According to the Respondents, 
												the Appellants warned them in 
												November 1996 not to expect any 
												sub-contract. However, on or 
												about the 26th of November 1996 
												the Appellants informed the 
												Respondents that the 
												sub-contract was available and 
												that if they were still 
												interested they should come down 
												to start the job immediately. 
												This urgency was probably due to 
												the fact that according to the 
												Appellants their own contract 
												with the owners required them to 
												have an air-conditioning 
												engineer on the site by October 
												1996. The Respondents replied, 
												accepting the offer, and 
												prepared feverishly to move to 
												the site. The Respondents' 
												Managing Director testified that 
												he came to Ghana on 7th December 
												1996, expecting to sign a 
												sub-contract but the Appellants 
												contract Manager was busy and 
												did not have time to go through 
												the details of the sub-contract 
												with him. Between 19th and 21st 
												December 1996, the Respondents 
												held discussions with the 
												Appellants on the terms of the 
												subcontract and on 23rd December 
												1996, minutes of their meeting 
												were signed. The minutes were 
												tendered in evidence as Exhibit 
												G. It contained the main terms 
												of their contract. The parties 
												further considered a draft 
												sub-contract. It was a standard 
												form contract used in the 
												building industry. They made 
												several changes there-to, by way 
												of additions, outright 
												cancellations or substitution.-

												marked HCN 2, the said agreement 
												was terminated by the first 
												applicant.Following the

												party instituted an action in 
												the High Court (Commercial

												following reliefs against the 
												first applicant: a declaration 
												that the notice of intention to 
												terminate the&nbsp; dealership

												defendant company does not 
												amount to a termination of the

												is vague, unreasonable and

												declaration that the conduct of

												tantamount to an undue 
												interference in and a disruption 
												of the plaintiff's business;a 
												further declaration that the

												companies smacks of racial 
												discrimination and such is 
												entitled to protection under the 
												Protection Against Unfair 
												Competition Act, 2000 (Act

                                                demand an amount of ¢100,000.00 
                                                (now Gh¢10.00) as the amount 
                                                spent by her on the abortion and 
                                                that his failure to pay led to 
                                                verbal insults by P.W.1 with a 
                                                threat by P.W.1 on their lives. 
                                                This incident is alleged to have 
                                                happened at about 
                                                11.00am.According to the 
                                                accused, PW1 returned later at 
                                                about 1.30pm with two other 
                                                friends and with more venom in 
                                                her, continued the verbal 
                                                assault on them and that it was 
                                                this noise which woke up PW5 
                                                Adeline Dzomeku who was asleep 
                                                in a nearby room opposite where 
                                                the rape allegedly took place. 
                                                The accused therefore denied in 
                                                its entirety the rape charge 
                                                against them. As was stated much

												Criminal Law - Narcotic Drugs &#8211; 
												Bail - </span></b>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is an appeal against the 
												refusal of the Court of Appeal 
												to grant an application for bail 
												to the appellants. The six 
												accused persons were arraigned 
												before the Greater Accra 
												Regional Tribunal on 28 January 
												2004 on narcotics-related 
												charges based on sections 56 
												(c), 1(1) and 2 of the Narcotic 
												Drugs (Control, Enforcement and 
												Sanctions Law), 1990 (PNDC 236). 
												The Tribunal as trial court 
												granted bail on 3rd February 
												2004 to all the accused on 
												specified conditions. The 
												Attorney-General&#8217;s Office 
												appealed against the grant of 
												bail to the Court of Appeal,&nbsp; 
												which delivered a ruling on 3<sup>rd</sup> 
												March 2004 upholding the appeal 
												and thereby rescinding the grant 
												of bail in respect of all the 
												accused. This matter came before 
												us on further appeal by all <u>
												but </u>one of the accused 
												persons, namely, the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												accused. The grounds of appeal 
												were set out in their respective 
												Notices of Appeal as follows: 
												The decision by the Court of 
												Appeal to allow the appeal 
												against the grant of bail to 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Accused/Appellant was 
												unreasonable having regard to 
												all the circumstances of the 
												case. The decision by the Court 
												of Appeal to allow the appeal 
												against the grant of bail to 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Accused/Appellant resulted in a 
												gross miscarriage of justice to 
												1<sup>st</sup> 
												Accused/Appellant, the reason 
												being that the basis of the 
												appeal before the Court of 
												Appeal and the reasons given by 
												the said Court for the 
												revocation of the bail granted 
												to 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Accused/Appellant warranted, at 
												the very least, a review of the 
												conditions upon which 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Accused/Appellant was granted 
												bail and not an outright refusal 
												of same. The Court of Appeal 
												erred in its interpretation of 
												the applicable provisions of the 
												Criminal Code 1960((Act 30) as 
												against the relevant provisions 
												of the Constitution 1992 of the 
												Republic of Ghana on the grant 
												of bail to accused persons, the 
												reason being that it downplayed 
												the constitutional provisions 
												providing for the pretrial 
												release of an accused person on 
												bail in favour of the guiding 
												(not mandatory) principles 
												governing the grant of bail as 
												contained in section 96 of Act 
												30. - <b>

												The Appellant is the former

												serve 4 years in jail on each 
												count plus a fine of 
												¢10,000,000.00 or, in default, 
												12 months in jail on count two. 
												Additionally, the Appellant was

												that on 21 Jan 1993, the 
												deceased Amegbor Amedorme took 
												John Narteh Amergbor (PW2) to 
												Adornukedzi Island to inspect 
												some palm trees that PW2 wanted

												but he did not respond. On their 
												way back the deceased was in the 
												lead followed by PW2 and then 
												PW3. According to PW2, the 
												appellant emerged from the back 
												of a palm tree and slashed the 
												neck of the deceased with a 
												cutlass and he staggered and 
												fell. The appellant turned on 
												him and he parried the blow and

												fingers. The appellant tried to 
												slash his stomach and once again 
												he tried to block the cutlass 
												and he had a cut on his right

												scene leaving the deceased 
												behind. His evidence was

												the appellant was that the land 
												belonged to his family and he 
												was on it to harvest palm fruits 
												to sell to pay his school fees. 
												His family and the deceased&#8217;s 
												family have been litigating over 
												the land. When he saw the 
												deceased and two others he asked 
												them their mission and the 
												deceased who was holding a 
												cutlass slashed him on the wrist 
												and left knee. He became furious 
												so he started brandishing the 
												cutlass he was holding and it 
												cut &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PW2 on his arm and 
												the neck of the deceased. The 
												deceased fell and the others 
												then fled and he decided to make

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The brief facts of the case on 
												appeal are that the plaintiff 
												obtained a customary grant of 
												the land in dispute from the 
												Manche Ankrah family sometime in 
												1962. He went into possession 
												almost immediately. Sometime in 
												1980 the defendant entered that 
												land and started putting up a 
												wooden structure. The plaintiff 
												promptly pulled down and 
												destroyed the wooden structure. 
												A complaint of this fracas was 
												made to the Ghana Police. The 
												Ghana Police did not pursue the 
												complaint and did not 
												investigate it. In the opinion 
												of the Ghana Police, the real 
												issue in dispute is the 
												ownership of the plot of land 
												therefore advised the rival 
												parties to seek redress in a 
												civil&nbsp; court. None of the 
												parties acted on the advice of 
												the Ghana Police. Sometime in 
												1981, the defendant commenced 
												building operations on the plot 
												of land. The plaintiff again 
												made a complaint of trespass 
												against the defendant. In the 
												meantime the plaintiff sued the 
												defendant in the High Court 
												Accra and claimed&nbsp; the reliefs 
												stated in the writ. The 
												defendant resisted the claim on 
												the ground that the plot of land 
												was originally allocated to his 
												mother on the occasion 30 
												members of Manche Ankrah family 
												were allocated plots of land, 
												including the plot in dispute, 
												by the Manche Ankrah family. He 
												pleaded that his mother had 
												remained in possession of the 
												plot since the said allocation. 
												In due course, one Nii Ayi 
												Ankrah applied to be joined as 
												co-defendant. He gave two main 
												reasons to support his 
												application. The first was that 
												the plot of land in dispute was 
												part of Manche Ankrah family 
												land. The other reason was that 
												the plot of land was customarily 
												granted to defendant's mother by 
												Manche Ankrah family. - <b>

												The basic facts giving rise to 
												this dispute are that Madam Wood 
												was the mother of the late 
												Sylvia Garshong) who died 
												intestate on 22<sup>nd</sup> 
												May, 1987, survived by three 
												children namely the Plaintiffs 
												and their younger sister, Sheila 
												Derban. Upon Sylvia&#8217;s death, 
												Madam Wood and the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Plaintiff obtained letters of 
												administration to administer 
												Sylvia&#8217;s estate which, according 
												to their declaration of the 
												immoveable property of Sylvia, 
												consisted, solely, of the 
												abovementioned property; it was 
												also her fixed place of abode at 
												the time of her death. After the 
												grant of the Letters of 
												Administration on 11<sup>th</sup> 
												November, 1987, Madam Wood, on 
												31<sup>st</sup> January 1989, 
												deposed to an &#8216;Affidavit as to 
												Change of Names on Housing 
												Records&#8217; wherein she declared, 
												inter, alia that she was the one 
												who financed the purchase of the 
												property and that she has made 
												extensions to the house. In the 
												Plaintiffs&#8217; Statement of Claim, 
												they asserted that since Sylvia 
												was not survived by a spouse, 
												the property devolved wholly to 
												her three children, pursuant to 
												the provisions of section 4(a) 
												of PNDCL 111. Hence, the said 
												children having become of full

												must join the 2<sup>nd</sup>

												The Plaintiff avers that she is 
												the head of her maternal family 
												and that she brought the action 
												on behalf of her said maternal 
												family. She alleges that 
												Defendants are the children of 
												the late Kwabena Asante alias 
												Kwabena Dan, her granduncle. 
												That late Kwabena Asante was one 
												of the four children of her 
												great grand mother the late 
												Ateakosuaa, and that her family 
												lived at Old Ampabame in 
												Kumasi.It is her case that the 
												Old Ampabame Township was 
												relocated from its old site to 
												its present site, to give way to 
												the Owabi head-works. The then 
												Gold Coast Government paid a 
												compensation of £30 to each 
												household for each house lost as 
												a result of the re-location. 
												Unspecified sums of money were 
												also paid as compensation for 
												each farm lost. Plaintiff&nbsp; 
												alleges further that the late 
												Kwabena&nbsp; Asante&nbsp; received the 
												compensation paid for their 
												family house at Ampabame, as 
												well as the&nbsp; unspecified sums of 
												money paid for the&nbsp; cocoa farm 
												of the late Kojo Mosi the then 
												deceased brother of&nbsp; Kwabena&nbsp; 
												Asante. That it was those sums 
												of money received by Kwabena 
												Asante as compensation for the 
												family house and Kojo Mosi&#8217;s 
												farm that Kwabena Asante applied 
												to the building of the disputed 
												house. The defendants denied the 
												plaintiff&#8217;s capacity and her 
												claim that the house in dispute 
												is her maternal family property. 
												For their part it is their case 
												that no compensation was paid to 
												any household for any house lost 
												and that Kwabena Asante did not 
												receive any compensation on 
												behalf of the plaintiff&#8217;s 
												family, which he could have 
												applied to the building of the 
												disputed house. <b>

												filed a petition at the High 
												Court in Kumasi for dissolution 
												of the marriage on the ground 
												that the Appellant had exhibited 
												a behavior of which she cannot 
												be expected to live with him and 
												that the appellant has caused

												The case arises out of the 
												decision of the Final Award 
												Committee of the West African 
												Examinations Council 
												(hereinafter referred to as the 
												council) not only to cancel the 
												entire results of the appellants 
												but also to ban them from taking 
												part in any examinations 
												conducted by it for three years. 
												The facts, which in my view are 
												essential for the determination 
												of this matter, are briefly that 
												the council is established by a 
												convention between 
												English-speaking West African 
												countries which was later 
												incorporated in the laws of 
												Ghana by the West African 
												Examinations Council Law, 1991 (PNDCL 
												225), with the sole authority to 
												conduct, in member countries, 
												such examinations as the council 
												may think appropriate and to 
												award certificates and diplomas 
												based on the results of such 
												examinations. The council, 
												therefore, is the sole 
												authority&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;responsible in 
												Ghana for the conduct of both 
												the Junior Secondary Basic 
												Education Certificate 
												Examinations (BECE) and Senior 
												Secondary School Certificate 
												Examinations (SSSCE). Between 
												October and December 2000, the 
												council, as it normally does 
												every academic year, conducted 
												the Senior Secondary School 
												Examinations throughout the 
												country.&nbsp; The appellants were 
												all candidates at this 
												examination with their parent 
												school, the Notre Dame Minor 
												Seminary in Navrongo in the 
												Upper East Region as their 
												examination centre.&nbsp; While 
												waiting for their results, the 
												appellants were informed through 
												the headmaster of the school 
												about the cancellation of their 
												entire result on the grounds 
												that they had been involved in 
												some examination malpractices or 
												irregularities in relation to 
												Mathematics (Core) Paper 2.&nbsp; The 
												nature of the irregularities the 
												appellants were said to have 
												indulged in was that they had 
												foreknowledge of the paper and 
												colluded among themselves in 
												solving the questions. Upon 
												receipt of the letter informing 
												him of the cancellation of the 
												results of the appellants and 
												the imposition on them of a 
												three-year ban from taking any 
												examinations under the auspices 
												of the council, the headmaster 
												of the Notre Dame School 
												petitioned the council to review 
												its decision.&nbsp; He advanced a 
												number of reasons why he felt 
												the sanctions needed a review.&nbsp; 
												The most important and relevant, 
												in my view, is his objection to 
												the procedure adopted by the 
												council in its investigations, 
												culminating in the punishment of 
												his students. He urged upon 
												the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; council 
												that the claim that the 
												appellants had foreknowledge of 
												the Mathematics (Core) Paper 2 
												is only an allegation and the 
												invocation and &#8220;application of 
												rule 56 without further 
												investigation to ascertain the

												allegation is a bit harsh on the 
												poor&nbsp;&nbsp;students. - <b>

												The appellant, who was employed

												recover what he thought he was 
												entitled to under the section

												redress, rightly in my view, 
												identified only one key issue 
												for determination. It was this:

												language of the CBA, an 
												occupational ill-health.The 
												trial court gave an affirmative

												Elections to be held in 
												December, 2004.&quot; The Plaintiff's 
												writ was supported by a 
												Statement of Case, and the 
												written submissions of his 
												counsel. There was no affidavit 
												by the plaintiff verifying facts 
												and particulars in his statement 
												of case, as required by Rule 
												46(2) (a) of C.I. 16. And 
												although the plaintiff's action

												the NDC, neither the NDC nor the 
												EC are made parties to the 
												action, nor even served with 
												copies of the writ and the 
												supporting papers. The

												stems from the hue and cry by 
												sections of the public in 
												reaction to the EC's decision to 
												feature the proposed 30 new 
												constituencies in the December 
												2004 Presidential and 
												Parliamentary Elections. There 
												were varied views. Some 
												contended that the newly created 
												constituencies should not 
												feature in the December 2004 
												General Elections but rather in 
												the 2008 elections. There were 
												still others who held that the

												should take place on 7th January

												seeking a declaration that the

												Jurisdiction - Out of time &#8211; 
												Nullity - </span></b>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is an application for an 
												order of certiorari directed to 
												the High Court, Accra presided 
												over by Nana Gyamera-Tawiah, J, 
												to quash its judgment given on 
												29th January, 2001 in the suit 
												entitled Jupiter Airlines vrs. 
												Continental Cargo and Trade 
												Service Inc., Suit No. MISC 
												258/2000.The only ground for the 
												application is that the judgment 
												is null and void because the 
												court lacked jurisdiction in the 
												suit the subject matter of this 
												application. The main reason for 
												this contention is that both the 
												Plaintiff and the Defendant in 
												the suit sought to be quashed 
												were outside the jurisdiction of 
												the court and the alleged 
												contract for sale as well as the 
												subject matter of the sale, an 
												aeroplane, also were all outside 
												the jurisdiction and had no 
												connection with Ghana.The 
												interested party has raised a 
												preliminary objection to the 
												application. His reason is that 
												the application is woefully out 
												of time: the judgment sought to 
												be quashed was delivered on 29th 
												January, 2001; and the instant 
												application was filed on 15th 
												May, 2002, some 15 months 
												later.&nbsp; Rule 62 of the Supreme 
												Court Rules, C.I. 16, requires 
												that an application to invoke 
												the supervisory jurisdiction of 
												the court must be filed within 
												90 days of the date of the 
												decision sought to be 
												quashed.The applicant&#8217;s answer 
												to the preliminary objection is 
												that since the decision of the 
												High Court was a nullity it can 
												be set aside at any time.In 
												applications for an order of 
												certiorari lawyers for 
												applicants are fond of 
												saying,&#8220;Where an act is void, 
												then it is in law a nullity. It 
												is not only bad but incurably 
												bad. There is no need for an 
												order of the court to set it 
												aside. It is automatically null 
												and void without more ado, 
												though it is sometimes 
												convenient to have the court 
												declare it to be so. And every 
												proceeding which is founded on 
												it is also bad and incurably 
												bad. You cannot put something on 
												nothing and expect it to be stay 
												there. It will collapse&#8221; - <b>

												&nbsp;Land&nbsp; -&nbsp; Recovery of

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The background to this appeal is 
												that, the appellant, on his own 
												behalf and as the Head of the 
												Aburadze family of Gwira 
												Akyinimu, claimed against the 
												respondent for declaration of 
												title to two pieces of land 
												known as Gwira Akyinimu, in the 
												Edina Traditional Area, and 
												orders for recovery of 
												possession and perpetual 
												injunction.The appellant's case 
												was to the effect, that the 
												disputed lands were originally 
												broken and settled by his 
												ancestor Kwesi Gwira, the first 
												Odikro, who had been accompanied 
												by his sister, Tseasewa. In the 
												course of time, according to the 
												appellant, a member of the 
												defendant's family married the 
												niece of the Odikro and, as a 
												result of the marriage, Gwira 
												promised that farming land would 
												be made available to members of 
												the respondent's family who 
												wished to farm, and this became 
												an established practice. Also, 
												according to the appellant, when 
												the respondent himself needed 
												land for a salt industry, he had 
												approached Nana Gwira III and 
												requested an allocation, which 
												request had been granted after 
												the&nbsp; performance of custom. 
												However, the respondent had, 
												without the consent of the 
												Odikro, attempted to extend the 
												area of his allocation, and, 
												moreover, had been claiming 
												ownership of the entire land and 
												purporting to sell portions 
												thereof, thereby precipitating 
												the suit. For his part, the 
												respondent, asserted that the 
												lands were the family's 
												ancestral property and that, 
												therefore, he needed no 
												permission or consent from the 
												appellant to alienate any part. 
												The respondent also claimed that

												&nbsp;In a terse pleadings as 
												contained in his statement of 
												claim, the 
												Plaintiff/Appellant/Appellant 
												(hereinafter referred to as the 
												Plaintiff) describes himself as 
												the Mantse of Boi, a village 
												near Abokobi and the lawful 
												representative of the Stool of 
												Boi and brings this action for 
												himself and on behalf of the 
												Stool of Boi. Plaintiff alleges 
												that the Stool land of Boi 
												village covers an approximate 
												area of 543.92 acres.<b> </b>The 
												Plaintiff alleges further that 
												the Defents/Respondents/Respondents 
												(hereinafter referred to as 
												Defendants) are inhabitants of 
												Abladzei another village also 
												near Abokobi and about three 
												miles away from Boi.<b> </b>
												According to Plaintiff, the 
												Stool of Boi gave the Defendants 
												predecessors leave and licence 
												to farm on the Northeastern 
												portion of Boi land, which 
												licence the Defendants were 
												enjoying.<b> </b>It is 
												contention of the Plaintiff 
												that, notwithstanding as 
												aforesaid, recently Defendants 
												started alleging title to the 
												land on which they were granted 
												leave to farm and have even 
												extended their claim to a 
												greater portion of Boi land. The 
												plaintiff maintains that the 
												Defendants&#8217; conduct constitutes 
												trespass on his ancestral land 
												and consequently warned them off 
												but they persist in their act of 
												trespass. Later 
												Co-Defendant/Respondents/Respondent 
												(hereinafter referred to as 
												Co-Defendant) Numo Nmashie 
												family of Teshie, through its 
												lawful head of family Nii Azaria 
												Adjei Klu, was made to join as 
												Co-Defendant. By their very 
												elaborate Statements of Defence, 
												Defendant and Co-Defendant deny 
												the Plaintiffs claim. They 
												maintain that the land in 
												dispute belong to the Nii Ashong 
												Lomotey family of which the 
												defendant are members. The said 
												land was a subject of a 
												customary grant made to their 
												said family by the original 
												owners Numo Nmashie family, the 
												Co-Defendant herein, some two 
												(200) hundred years ago, and 
												they have been in possession 
												ever since. <b>

                                                declaration covering the land 
                                                was used to procure a Land Title

                                                The cause of action against the 
                                                defendants is that the 
                                                defendants had broken the wall 
                                                on part of the land which serves 
                                                as the boundary between the 
                                                defendants&#8217; 
                                                predecessors-in-title&#8217;s land and 
                                                that of the plaintiffs. The 
                                                defendant controverted most of 
                                                the allegations of facts pleaded 
                                                but it appears that when the 
                                                evidence was led it became clear 
                                                that the defendants acquired 
                                                their land from one Mr. Yawson 
                                                who inherited the land from his 
                                                father.&nbsp; After the death of the 
                                                first defendant&#8217;s father, the 
                                                property passed on to the first 
                                                defendant.&nbsp; A vesting asset was 
                                                prepared after the 
                                                administrators had applied for 
                                                and obtained letters of

                                                to be vested in the first 
                                                defendant who sold the property 
                                                to the second defendant.&nbsp; In the 
                                                course of his evidence, the 
                                                second defendant claimed that 
                                                the property was acquired in the 
                                                name of his firm for a

												The Plaintiff traced his root of 
												title to a conveyance dated 11<sup>th</sup> 
												October 1977, made between Nii 
												Nikoi Amontia IV, Asere Mantse 
												of Accra on the one hand and the 
												Plaintiff on the other. This 
												deed of conveyance was stamped 
												as AC 11330/77. It was, however, 
												not registered. The Plaintiff 
												pleaded that his said land was 
												situated at Chuim, Odorkor-Accra, 
												&#8220;containing an approximate area 
												of 0.34 acre and bounded on the 
												North East by a proposed road 
												measuring 130 feet more or less,

												averred that in 1978 the 
												Defendant trespassed on to his 
												said piece or parcel of land.

												pleaded that the land claimed by 
												the Plaintiff formed part of a 
												larger area of land owned by the 
												Gbawe Kwatei family. He denied

												statement of defence the 
												co-Defendant denied that the 
												land in dispute belonged to the 
												Plaintiff. He averred that

												genesis of this appeal is that, 
												sometime in or about the year 
												2002, the Respondent, who is the 
												Pastor of a Church known as the 
												Bethel Praise Ministries 
												International, sold to the 
												Appellant a piece of land 
												situate at McCarthy Hill, Accra. 
												No formal documents were 
												executed evidencing the sale but 
												the fact of the sale is not 
												disputed by either party. The 
												Appellant made a down-payment of 
												¢120,000,000.00, in respect of 
												which the Respondent issued to 
												him a receipt dated 8<sup>th</sup> 
												January 2002. According to the 
												Appellant, very shortly after 
												making the said payment, he 
												discovered that the Respondent 
												had previously sold the same 
												piece of land to another person, 
												Construction Pioneers Company 
												Limited. He, therefore, demanded 
												a refund of the said 
												down-payment, less 
												¢20,000,000.00, which he asked 
												the Respondent to keep. The 
												Respondent having failed to make 
												the refund as demanded, the 
												Appellant, issued a writ against 
												him in the High Court (suit No. 
												C1098/02) for the recovery of 
												the said down-payment. By a 
												summary judgment entered on 21<sup>st</sup> 
												March 2003, the court found in 
												favour of the Appellant on his 
												claim and adjudged the 
												Respondent liable to him in the 
												full amount of ¢120,000,000.00 
												together with interest thereon

												The trial judge resolved the 
												rival claims in favour of the 
												plaintiff on the grounds <b><i>
												inter alia</i></b>, that the 
												plaintiff was a bona-fide 
												purchaser of the land without 
												notice of the fact that Nii Odai 
												Ayiku IV of Nungua the grantor 
												of his vendor had been, prior to 
												his vendor's &nbsp;purported 
												acquisition of title from him, 
												destooled.&nbsp; As to a judgment 
												affecting the land by an Accra 
												Circuit Court the trial judge 
												held that it is a settled 
												principle that a purchaser of 
												land is not estopped or affected 
												by a judgment adverse to his 
												vendor in proceedings commenced 
												subsequent to the acquisition of 
												his title.&nbsp; The trial judge also 
												held that if the co-defendant 
												had made the proper search at 
												the proper place he would have 
												known of the plaintiff's prior 
												title, secured by a Land title 
												Certificate, to the land and is 
												therefore bound by it. The Court

												showed that it was leased to W. 
												C. Tandoh of West Coast Dying 
												Industries Ltd. He rented it to 
												the respondent who shall 
												hereafter be referred to as the 
												plaintiff. He later sold his 
												interest in the land to the 
												plaintiff. The plaintiff then 
												proceeded to register it at the 
												Lands Commission. The interest 
												of Tandoh dated from 1<sup>st</sup> 
												August 1974. Therefore, his 
												interest which he sold to the 
												plaintiff was dated from the 
												same 1<sup>st</sup> August 1974. 
												The land sold to the plaintiff 
												consisted of three plots which 
												were numbered as LI 1, 2 and 3. 
												The plaintiff put up factories 
												on two plots, leaving the third 
												plot for future development. The 
												plaintiff later observed that 
												there were encroachments on his 
												land which he traced to the 
												appellants, who shall hereafter 
												be referred to as the 
												defendants. In fact the 
												defendants were constructing a 
												fence wall on the third plot. 
												When he did not succeed in 
												getting them to stop the 
												encroachments, he instituted 
												action in the Tema Circuit Court 
												claiming declaration of title to 
												the land and perpetual 
												injunction against the 
												defendants or their agents. <b>

												5th February 1999, the plaintiff 
												filed this action at the High

												after a full trial and having 
												carefully weighted all the 
												evidence contained in the

												This right of the Baako family 
												as against the Ablorh Mills 
												family over Sabon Zongo land 
												dates back to 1909 when the said 
												lands were granted to the Baako 
												family as a settlement for the 
												Hausa community, with the 
												knowledge and consent of the 
												Ablorh Mills family who are the 
												grantors of Plaintiff's father. 
												Exhibit 4, which is a 1912

												Smyly and the other judgments of 
												the Superior Courts tendered as

												same in 1972 null and void.&quot;This 
												notwithstanding, the trial judge 
												went ahead to grant the 
												plaintiff the reliefs he was 
												seeking. It was the opinion of 
												the trial judge that the 
												Defendant's family had slept on 
												its rights for more than the 
												statutory period. The trial 
												judge computed that the 
												plaintiff's family had been in 
												adverse possession for more than 
												30years, before the Defendant 
												filed his counterclaim. Thus on 
												the application of the 
												Limitation Decree 1972 NRCD, 54, 
												the counterclaim was declared by 
												the trial judge to be statute 
												barred and under sub-section (6) 
												of Section 10 of the Decree, the 
												title of the Defendant's family 
												became extinguished.The trial

												<b>Pension Scheme.</b> - The 
												applicant Association is made up 
												of pioneer staff which worked to 
												establish the Ghana Commercial 
												Bank. At the commencement of the 
												suit before the High Court in 
												January 1995 it had about 770 
												members but as at January 2002, 
												when the instant application was 
												brought, about 89 of them had 
												died, remaining 681. In 1976 a 
												scheme was introduced by the 
												bank known as the Ghana 
												Commercial Bank Special Pension 
												Scheme. The objects of the 
												scheme included the following: 
												To serve and reward for long 
												service and devotion to duty;To 
												provide employees with 
												satisfaction that they need not 
												have financial worries because 
												of age or infirmity.The 
												Directors of the Bank for the 
												time being were the Trustees of 
												the scheme which came into 
												operation on 1st October 1976.At 
												its meeting held on 27th 
												February 1987 the Board of 
												Trustees approved a proposal for 
												the revision of the pension 
												scheme as presented to it in a 
												Memo dated 13th February, 1987. 
												The proposal which was approved 
												was in these terms:In October 
												1986.....the Government approved 
												new pensions for the Civil 
												Service based on 70% of the 
												existing salary of the goods on 
												retirement. The Board of 
												Trustees of Ghana Commercial 
												Bank Special Staff Pension 
												Scheme at a meeting held on 17th 
												December, 1986, agreed that 
												proportionate adjustments should 
												be effected to the Bank's 
												pensions based on current basic 
												salaries with effect from 
												October, 1986. It was also 
												agreed to recommend automatic 
												adjustments of pensions whenever 
												salaries change.&quot;Following 
												disputes between the Association 
												and the Bank over the Bank's 
												obligations under the scheme the 
												Association (Plaintiffs) brought 
												on action on 23rd January 1995 
												in the High Court seeking inter

												This is an appeal from the 
												decision of the Court of Appeal 
												which allowed an appeal against 
												the decision of the High Court 
												sitting at Koforidua. The facts 
												which gave rise to the 
												litigation before this court are 
												as follows: The plaintiff who 
												shall hereafter be referred to 
												as the appellant claimed that he 
												alone bought the subject matter 
												of the case which is a house 
												together with an adjoining plot, 
												both of which are situated at 
												Apedwa. He further claimed to 
												have bought it from its original 
												owner, the United African 
												Company and after the purchase 
												he permitted his late brother 
												and the brother&#8217;s family to live 
												in it. The respondent was the 
												wife of the late brother who 
												also lived in the house. It was 
												part of the case of the 
												appellant that after the death 
												of her husband the respondent 
												admitted at various meetings 
												that the property belonged to 
												the appellant. The respondent 
												denied the claims of the 
												appellant. She rather contended 
												that the property was bought 
												jointly by the appellant and her 
												deceased husband who was the 
												half brother of the appellant. 
												After the trial, the High Court 
												gave judgment for the appellant. 
												The respondent then appealed to 
												the Court of Appeal which 
												allowed the appeal and reversed 
												the judgment of the High Court. 
												Aggrieved by that decision, the 
												appellant appealed to this 
												court. - <b>

												of Senchi acquired by purchase a 
												piece and parcel of land 
												covering an area of70.91 acres 
												from one Isaac Mensavi Dugbatey. 
												This Mensavi Dugbatey was a 
												citizen of Ada who had lived at 
												Senchi for .a long time and was 
												leaving for his hometown for 
												good and decided to sell his 
												land. The Mankrado of Senchi &#8211; 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Defendant herein and Opanin Dade 
												Kofi - a witness in this case 
												told Opanin Amoaforo of the 
												land. Opanin Amoaforo told them 
												he would buy the land but he 
												would first inform the 
												Traditional Council for their 
												approval. This was because as 
												Opanin Dade Kofi put it in his 
												supporting evidence, Mensah 
												Dugbatey was a stranger leaving 
												Senchi for his hometown, so 
												Opanin Amoaforo wanted to buy 
												the land publicly as he did not 
												want any shoddy deal. The Akwamu 
												State Council met and approved 
												of the sale. Among the elders 
												present at the State Council 
												meeting were Opanin Dade Kofi 
												and the Chief/Mankorado of 
												Senchi, the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Defendant herein. After the 
												endorsement of the sale by the 
												State Council the land was 
												demarcated to Opanin Amoaforo 
												who bought it for £200. Elders 
												of Senchi including Opanin Dade 
												Kofi and the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Defendant &#8211; Chief/Mankrado of 
												Senchi, witnessed the 
												demarcation.Later a Deed of 
												Conveyance was executed between 
												Issac Mensavi Dugbatey and 
												Opanin Kwame Amoaforo to cover 
												the sale transaction.The 
												Omanhene of Akwamu Traditional 
												Area - Nana Kwafo Akoto II and 
												some of his elders, endorsed the 
												deed. After the endorsement by 
												the Omanhene, same was stamped 
												and registered at the Land 
												Registry in Accra&nbsp; as Deeds 
												Registry No. 2115/1960. It is 
												part of plaintiff&#8217;s case that 
												after his father had purchased 
												the land, the father planted 
												corn and oil palm trees.&nbsp; He 
												also granted portions of the 
												land to tenant formers on 
												tenancy basis.&nbsp; Plaintiff&#8217;s 
												father died in 1962, after 
												working on the land for 12 
												years.&nbsp; He was succeeded by his 
												nephew one Osei Kwaku who 
												continued from where his late 
												uncle had left off.&nbsp; He, too, 
												cultivated orn and yam.&nbsp; After 
												working on the land for 
												sometime, Osei Kwaku called the 
												plaintiff and his brothers and 
												sisters and told them that after 
												all the land belong to them and 
												that they should perform the

												the plaintiff&#8217;s family turned 
												the site into a layout for 
												residential purposes that the 
												first defendant resisted the 
												action and made a grant of a 
												portion to the second 
												defendant.&nbsp; The plaintiff 
												further averred that his family 
												lodged a complaint with 
												Ahantahen at Busua who went into 
												the matter by way of an 
												arbitration after which the 
												first defendant was found 
												liable. In his amended statement 
												of defence the defendant&#8217;s

												lodged a complaint with 
												Ahantahen at Busua but denied 
												that there was any proper 
												arbitration because the 
												proceedings were not an 
												arbitration and cannot ground an 
												estoppel.&nbsp; On the contrary the 
												purpose of the complaint was to 
												attempt an amicable settlement 
												of the differences between the 
												parties.&nbsp; The defendants averred 
												that the ownership of the land 
												had been determined in a 
												judgment delivered on 10 
												December, 1912 by His Worship 
												H.C.W. Grimshaw.&nbsp; In that case 
												the plaintiff&#8217;s ancestor called 
												Araba Aryeh testified and 
												confirmed the sale of the land 
												by auction.&nbsp; That being the case 
												the plaintiff is estopped from 
												laying claim to the disputed 
												land.&nbsp; The defendants again 
												relied on another case in which 
												one L.T.F.&nbsp; Sagoe successfully 
												sued one Ngya Assafuah a 
												predecessor of the plaintiff in 
												the District Court, Sekondi in 
												1970.&nbsp; The defendants further 
												averred that the first 
												defendant&#8217;s father also 
												exercised rights of ownership 
												over the land, and after his 
												death the land devolved on the 
												first defendant who had been 
												making grants to several persons 
												including the second defendant.&nbsp; 
												It was part of the case for the 
												defendants that the first 
												defendant started farming on the

												land. The Mankrado of Senchi - 1 
												st Defendant herein and Opanin 
												Dade Kofi - a witness in this 
												case told Opanin Amoaforo of the 
												land. Opanin Amoaforo told them 
												he would buy the land but he 
												would first inform the 
												Traditional Council for their 
												approval. This was because as 
												Opanin Dade Kofi put it in his 
												supporting evidence, Mensah 
												Dugbatey was a stranger leaving 
												Senchi for his hometown, so 
												Opanin Amoaforo wanted to buy 
												the land publicly as he did not 
												want any shoddy deal. The Akwamu 
												State Council met and approved 
												of the sale. Among the elders 
												present at the State Council 
												meeting were Opanin Dade Kofi 
												and the ChieflMankorado of 
												Senchi, the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Defendant herein.After the 
												endorsement of the sale by the 
												State Council the land was 
												demarcated to Opanin Amoaforo 
												who bought it for £200. Elders 
												of Senchi including Opanin Dade 
												Kofi and the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Defendant - Chief lMankrado of 
												Senchi, witnessed the 
												demarcation.Later a Deed of 
												Conveyance was executed between 
												Issac Mensavi Dugbatey and 
												Opanin K wame Amoaforo to cover 
												the sale transaction.The 
												Omanhene of Akwamu Traditional 
												Area - Nana Kwafo Akoto II and 
												some of his elders, endorsed the 
												deed. After the endorsement by 
												the Omanhene, same was stamped 
												and registered at the Land 
												Registry in Accra as Deeds 
												Registry No. 211/1960.&nbsp; The 
												Registered deed is in evidence 
												as Exhibit &#8216;A&#8217;.It is part of 
												plaintiff&#8217;s case that after his 
												father had purchased the land, 
												the father planted corn and oil 
												palm tress.&nbsp; He also put up 
												buildings in addtion to what had 
												been built by Dugbatey.&nbsp; He also 
												granted portions of the land to 
												tenants farmers on tenancy 
												basis.&nbsp; Plaintiff&#8217;s father died 
												in 1962, after working on the 
												land for 12 years.&nbsp; He was 
												succeeded by his nephew one Osei 
												Kwaku who continued from where 
												his late uncle had left off.&nbsp; 
												He, too, cultivated corn and 
												yam.&nbsp; After working on the land 
												for sometime, Osei Kwaku called 
												the plaintiff and his brothers 
												and sisters and told them that 
												after all the land belong to 
												them and that they should 
												perform the necessary custom for 
												the formal handling over of the 
												land to them.&nbsp; This statement 
												was repeated by P. W. 2 
												Elizabeth Adwoa Amoaforo alias 
												Adwoa Adwoase &#8211; sister of the 
												plaintiff &#8211; in her unchallenged 
												evidence to support the gift by 
												Osei Kwaku.&nbsp; Plaintiff and his 
												brothers and sisters duly 
												performed custom by presenting a 
												sheep and one bottle Schnapps as 
												Aseda; whereby Osei Kwaku 
												formally gifted the land to 
												them.&nbsp; When plaintiff and his 
												brothers and sisters were given 
												possession of the land they 
												cultivated corn and other food 
												crops &#8211; until later when Osei 
												Kwaku died.- <b>

												Defendant successfully joined

												within the family and the 
												inaction of the head of family 
												despite repeated calls on him to 
												act decisively in defence of the 
												family&#8217;s rights, maintained that

												Nana Kweku Bewuowu around 1906.

												the Kumasi Public Health Board 
												acquired a site in the vicinity 
												of his ancestor&#8217;s property for

												had acquired for the project,

												the two buildings which his

												The facts briefly of this case 
												are that one Kofi Safo whose 
												estate is the subject-matter of 
												the action, had died on 22nd 
												April, 1998 and his wife Mrs. 
												Grace Safo, the 1st Plaintiff in 
												the action and the 1st 
												Defendant, Elvis Appiah a 
												brother of the deceased had been 
												granted Letters of 
												Administration on 12th August, 
												1998 to administer the estate of 
												the deceased. The Inventory 
												filed of the estate had included 
												House No. D.767/4 Beach Avenue 
												which the Defendants claimed 
												belonged to the 2nd 
												Defendant-Company. Though no 
												papers or documents have been 
												exhibited in this application 
												showing material particulars 
												such as the share capital or the 
												shareholding, the directors 
												(including the Managing 
												Director), the Secretary, 
												Auditor/Accountants, the balance 
												sheet showing the assets and 
												liabilities etc. etc. of the 2nd 
												Defendant Company, it appears 
												that the Company undisputably 
												had been incorporated solely by 
												the deceased as a limited 
												liability company with a share 
												Capital. The Plaintiffs claim 
												that the late Kofi Boye Safo 
												owned 100% of the shares. This 
												is however disputed by the 
												Defendants who claim that they 
												have interest in the shares and 
												that the deceased held the 
												shares in trust for them. These 
												are issues to be resolved by 
												evidence, but it is not disputed 
												by the parties that the Company 
												is a limited liability company. 
												With this disagreement between 
												the parties, concerning the 
												contents of the estate there was 
												bound to be problems and an 
												impasse in the administration of 
												the estate. It was therefore not 
												surprising that on 10th 
												December, 1998, the Plaintiffs 
												issued out a Writ of Summons -

                                                trial, this letter was tendered 
                                                in evidence as Exhibit &#8216;B&#8217;.&nbsp; The

                                                was that he had been implicated

                                                investigations. The respondent 
                                                contended that the Police did 
                                                not make any adverse findings 
                                                against him and did not charge 
                                                him with any offence. It was 
                                                further contended by the 
                                                respondent at no point in time 
                                                did the appellant company invite 
                                                him to confront him with any 
                                                allegations of impropriety 
                                                before he was suspended. The 
                                                respondent&#8217;s Solicitor wrote to 
                                                the appellant company to 
                                                reconsider the decision to 
                                                suspend the respondent as 
                                                according to the Solicitor, the

                                                basic rules of natural justice. 
                                                The appellant justified the 
                                                decision to suspend the 
                                                respondent.Following the

												The facts that gave rise to this 
												appeal are as follows; the 
												appellant, the Ghana Commercial 
												Bank, employed the complainant 
												for some twenty-one years. In 
												1984, his appointment was 
												terminated at a time when he was 
												a manager of the bank. The 
												reason for the termination was 
												that he had contravened the 
												regulations of the bank by 
												granting a loan facility of six 
												million and seven hundred 
												thousand Cedis to a customer of 
												the bank without prior approval 
												from its head office. In 
												addition to terminating the 
												appointment, the appellant 
												withheld the entitlements of the 
												complainant until such time that 
												the customer would pay the 
												loan.&nbsp; According to the 
												complainant, he granted the 
												facility in the normal course of 
												business and after he had 
												satisfied himself of the 
												customer&#8217;s assets, the purpose 
												for the loan and the viability 
												of the customer&#8217;s business; the 
												loan was also secured with 
												assets of the customer worth 
												twenty -five million Cedis. 
												Dissatisfied with the action 
												taken against him, the 
												complainant petitioned the 
												Commissioner for Human Rights 
												and Administrative Justice for 
												redress. After investigating the 
												petition, the Commission decided 
												in favour of the complainant by 
												recommending that the appellant 
												paid the complainant some sums 
												of money. The appellant failed 
												to comply with the 
												recommendations of the 
												Commission. To enforce its 
												decision and recommendations, 
												the Commission then applied to 
												the High Court in the terms of 
												the 1992 Constitution, art. 216 
												and the Commission for Human 
												Rights and Administrative 
												Justice Act, 1993 (Act 456).- <b>

												shall not operate any form of

												statutory body charged under the

												management and control of all

												the subject-matter of these

												events which triggered this 
												action, the vessels were berthed 
												at different locations.<i> </i>
												The <i>M V Nova VII</i> was 
												berthed at the Tema Fishing 
												Harbour, while the sister ship, 
												the <i>MV Nova VIII</i>, was 
												berthed at the Shipyard and&nbsp; 
												Dry-dock of the Tema Port. On 18

												maintained that the beaching was

                                                we refer to the 
                                                plaintiff/respondent/appellant 
                                                as the plaintiff and the 
                                                defendants/appellants/respondents 
                                                as the defendants. What the 
                                                plaintiff took to the High Court 
                                                for determination was in respect 
                                                of his family&#8217;s ancestral land 
                                                which his great-grand-father, 
                                                Tei Djabakor, and his brother 
                                                Tetteh Akporsuer acquired by 
                                                settlement. According to his 
                                                pleading, his ancestors gave a 
                                                portion of their land to the 
                                                defendants&#8217; ancestor by name 
                                                Numo Amartey in 1910 as a 
                                                licensee. What brought about the 
                                                dispute between the plaintiff&#8217;s 
                                                family and the defendants&#8217;

                                                Numo Amartey, is the refusal by 
                                                the defendants to recognize the 
                                                plaintiff&#8217;s family as owners of

												Parliamentary Candidates - Civil 
												Service</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
												- <b>Constitution</b> - The gist 
												of the Plaintiff&#8217;s case is that 
												a publication appeared in the 
												State owned newspaper &#8220;The 
												Ghanaian Times of 6th June 2000 
												at p. 10 thereof to the effect 
												that 2nd and 3rd Defendants are 
												Civil Servants working at the 
												Ministries of Finance, and Mines 
												and Energy respectively and that 
												1st Defendant is reported to 
												have decided to approve their 
												nomination as parliamentary 
												candidates in the November 2000 
												Election for the Asante Akyem 
												North and Bosomtwe 
												constituencies and that they 
												were actively campaigning as 
												such. It is to be noted that in 
												June this year the nomination 
												exercise of Parliamentary 
												candidates had not even 
												commenced. It is the case of the 
												Plaintiff, that by virtue of 
												Article 94(3)(b) a member of the 
												Civil Service is not eligible to 
												be a member of Parliament and 
												therefore the approval by the 
												1st Defendant for the future 
												nomination of the 2nd and 3rd 
												Defendants as Parliamentary 
												candidates, is a gross and 
												patent violation of the 
												Constitution in Particular 
												Article 94(3)(b) therefore and 
												is accordingly null and void and 
												of no effect. But the approval 
												to the future nomination is 
												really a mere intent and I fail 
												to see how an intention to do 
												something in the future without 
												more, can be equated to the 
												performance of an &#8220;act&#8221; which 
												could be relied on as a basis 
												for charging person with breach 
												of the constitution. Article 
												2(1)(b) requires the doing of 
												something&#8212;an &#8220;act&#8221; which is 
												inconsistent with the 
												Constitution before action can 
												be taken against the Defendant.-

												witness</b> - The parties were 
												agreeable that the appellant was 
												at all material times during the 
												litigation resident in England 
												but sued through Nana Kwasi Twum 
												Barima by the use of a power of 
												attorney which was exhibited at 
												page fifteen of the record of 
												proceedings. That power of 
												attorney was fatally flawed for 
												two reasons. Firstly, the rule 
												as contained in Act 548, s. 1(2) 
												is that &#8220;Where the instrument is 
												signed by the author of the 
												power one witness shall be 
												present and shall attest the 
												instrument.&#8221;It is patent on the 
												instrument that no-one signed it 
												as a witness. The Court of 
												Appeal rightly rejected the 
												argument of counsel for the 
												appellant that the Commissioner 
												for Oath doubled as both the 
												witness and the person before 
												whom the power was executed. 
												There is no legal or statutory 
												basis for that argument. It 
												would be observed that the 
												provision is couched in 
												imperative terms. In so far that 
												the power of attorney in 
												question was not signed by any 
												witness, it was not valid. - <b>

												- The applicant , by a consent 
												judgment dated the 30/07/2008 
												was adjudged to pay to the 
												interested party (plaintiff) in 
												the said case an amount of 
												$1,950,000 together with 
												interest and cost of GH¢250,000.&nbsp; 
												In the judgment after trial to 
												enforce the judgment, it appears 
												that the judgment debt and costs 
												were to be paid by installments 
												with the usual default clause 
												permitting the interested party 
												herein (as the judgment 
												/creditor) to proceed to levy 
												execution upon default on the 
												part of the applicant herein. 
												The applicant defaulted and when 
												the interested party commenced 
												execution processes, the 
												applicant on the 15/09/2008 
												filed an application to stay 
												execution and payment for the 
												judgment debt by installments.&nbsp; 
												When the application was argued 
												before His Lordship Mr. Justice 
												Kwofie, he on the 26/10/2008

                                                - This action was instituted in 
                                                November 1999 and it took seven

                                                delivered in February 2006.

                                                it may, the judgment was 
                                                delivered on 22/02/96 and 
                                                immediately an appeal was filed 
                                                against it. Four (4) years on,

                                                substantive suit has not seen 
                                                the light of day. In the interim 
                                                a motion for stay of execution 
                                                has been granted by the CA after

                                                been granted by the High Court,

                                                process at the Court of Appeal 
                                                for the same relief. Based on 
                                                the affidavits before them, the 
                                                learned Justices of the Court of

                                                refused the application. And now

                                                this Court.&nbsp;Why the appellant 
                                                herein, is expending his 
                                                energies on nibbling at the 
                                                bones i.e. these interlocutory 
                                                matters, instead of ensuring 
                                                that the respondents herein, 
                                                pursue and conclude the appeal 
                                                on the substantive action, beats 
                                                my imagination. It is as if none 
                                                of the Counsel is interested in 
                                                the appeal, to the detriment of 
                                                the parties, especially, the

												<b>Power of Attorney - </b>The 
												applicant herein was sued by the 
												interested party for recovery of 
												a sum of money due and owing to 
												the interested party.&nbsp; The usual 
												ancillary relief of interest was 
												also endorsed on the writ.&nbsp; The 
												facts leading to the claim is 
												not necessary for the 
												determination of this 
												application.&nbsp; It appears, 
												however, that the interested 
												party was represented by its 
												lawful attorney, one Mr. Kwaku 
												Twumasi Ampofo.&nbsp; The High Court, 
												at the application for 
												directions set down the issue of 
												capacity of the interested party 
												to be argued by the parties, as 
												the applicant had challenged the 
												capacity of the plaintiffs on 
												the grounds that the Power of 
												Attorney was irregular. On 
												6/12/2005, the High Court 
												dismissed the application to set 
												aside the writ on grounds of 
												want of capacity.&nbsp; The 
												applicants herein appealed to 
												the Court of Appeal which by a 
												majority decision on 12/07/2007 
												allowed the appeal and set aside 
												the writ of summons and made 
												further consequential orders

												Practice and Procedure &#8211; 
												Delivery of&nbsp; Judgment -</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial">
												<b>Chief Justice</b> - According 
												to the plaintiffs, who were a 
												firm of international traders in 
												the U.S.A., on 2nd September, 
												1987 they conveyed and sold to 
												the defendants by sea freight, a 
												consignment of 38,491 pairs of 
												used olive green shorts at the 
												price of USD 1.20 a pair, 25 
												pairs of soccer boots at USD 
												1.00 a pair, bringing the total 
												price of the goods to USD 
												46,214.20. Also, on 5th October 
												1989, they sold and conveyed to 
												the defendants, 1280 cartons of 
												sundry biscuits valued at USD 
												15,208. As at the time 
												plaintiffs instituted the 
												instant action the defendants 
												had paid USD 20,088 of the total 
												value of the goods and later USD 
												4,000.The Defendants did not 
												dispute the plaintiffs&#8217; claim 
												relating to the second 
												consignment of goods, but they 
												contended the first consignment 
												of used olive green shorts was 
												not sold to them but sent to 
												them on sell-or-return basis and 
												therefore they remain the 
												property of the plaintiffs and 
												were being kept in the 
												defendants&#8217; warehouse at ¢25,000 
												per year. The main issue between 
												the parties was, therefore, 
												whether the first consignment of 
												goods was sold to the defendants 
												or not; that is whether or not 
												the goods, the subject-matter of 
												the claim were sold to the 
												defendants outright or sold to 
												them on sell-or-return basis.In 
												their first ground of appeal the 
												defendants contend that the 
												court of Appeal erred in holding 
												that the provisions of Order 63 
												Rule 2A of the High Court (Civil 
												Procedure) Rules 1954 (L.N. 
												140A) as amended by L.I 1107 are 
												purely administrative (or 
												directory) and its infringement 
												by a Court will not render a 
												judgment null and void. They 
												also contend, that the judgment 
												of the Court of Appeal is null 
												and void, having been given on 
												15th April, 1999 a few days 
												after eight weeks after close of 
												case contrary to Rule 33 
												sub-rules 1 and 2 of the Court 
												of Appeal Rules, 1997, C.I. 19.

												Practice and Procedure - 
												Estoppel</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
												- <b>Judgment - Recovery of 
												possession - </b>This is an 
												appeal from the judgment of the 
												Court of Appeal dated 29/6/ 
												2000. It was a decision which 
												reversed the trial High Court's 
												judgment in favour of the 
												plaintiff/respondent/appellant 
												whom we shall hereafter refer to 
												simply as the appellant. The 
												defendants/appellants/respondents 
												will similarly be referred to as 
												the respondents simpliciter. The 
												appellant filed and argued four 
												grounds of appeal &#8212; two original 
												grounds plus two additional 
												grounds. They are that: The 
												judgment is wrong in law;The 
												judgment is against the weight 
												of evidence;The learned justices 
												erred in granting the order of 
												recovery of possession in the 
												absence of evidence that the 
												landlord had served the 
												requisite statutory notice on 
												the tenant which notice is a 
												condition precedent to taking 
												any action based on the said 
												breach;In view of the 
												substantial works on the 
												premises in the nature of 
												renovations, the learned 
												justices ought to have suspended 
												the order for recovery of 
												possession in the interest of 
												justice.The grounds (1) and (3) 
												above deserve some comment. Rule 
												6 (4) of the Supreme Court 
												Rules, 1996, C.I. 16 requires 
												that &quot; where a ground of appeal 
												is one of law the appellant 
												shall indicate the stage of the 
												proceedings at which it was 
												first raised&quot;. Ground (3) is 
												expressed as a ground of law and 
												the appellant ought to have 
												indicated whether he had raised 
												it before now, or whether he is 
												now raising it for the first 
												time. The significance of this 
												requirement will be seen later 
												in this judgment. Similarly, 
												when the appellant alleged in 
												ground (1) that the judgment is 
												wrong in law it seems that he is 
												in effect saying that there is 
												an error of law in the judgment; 
												we believe that was what he 
												intended to say. Indeed that 
												ground of appeal appears to have 
												been directed at the Court of 
												Appeal's holding that the 
												appellant was estopped per rem 
												judicatam from instituting the 
												action because the appellant's 
												submission on that ground is 
												that &quot; the instant case was not 
												properly within the realm of 
												estoppel per rem judicatam and 
												the Court of Appeal misapplied 
												the doctrine&quot;. In that regard 
												too the appellant again ought to 
												have indicated in the said 
												ground (1) the fact that the 
												decision as to the estoppel was 
												what he was attacking as having 
												rendered the judgment wrong in 
												law. If that holding amounted to 
												an error in law, then rule 6 (2) 
												requires the appellant to 
												specify it in the ground of 
												appeal as the subject of this 
												particular complaint &#8212; [see rule 
												6 (2)(f) of C.I. 16].- <b>

												the brief facts. On 13th April 
												1981, the Plaintiff took action 
												at the Accra High Court against 
												the Defendants, claiming as 
												later amended:-&#8220;A declaration 
												that in or about June/July 1979 
												she was the owner of all that 
												piece or parcel of land situate 
												at Madina and known as&nbsp; House 
												NO. B/MDN/14 and fully described 
												in the attached&nbsp; plan and Deed 
												Registered as No. 4446/1978. 
												That the sale of the said 
												property by the 1st Defendant to 
												the 2nd Defendant in June 1979 
												is null and void.General 
												Damages&#8221;.Later on, one Osmanu 
												Alhassan was joined as 
												Co-plaintiff. On 14th August 
												1989, the trial High Court 
												dismissed the action with costs 
												against the Plaintiff and 
												Co-plaintiff. An appeal to the 
												Court of Appeal was also 
												dismissed on 25th July 1995. A 
												further appeal to the Supreme 
												Court was once again dismissed 
												on 17th June 1998. Still 
												undaunted the plaintiff and 
												co-plaintiff filed a motion on 
												2nd July 1998 for a review of 
												the Supreme Court&#8217;s judgment. It 
												is in respect of this review 
												application that the plaintiff 
												and Co-plaintiff/Applicants now 
												seek leave to amend their 
												statement of case.- <b>

                                                The facts which gave rise to the 
                                                case are as follows: Mancell 
                                                Vocational Institute 
                                                (hereinafter referred to as the 
                                                Institute) was owned by Mrs. 
                                                Rosamund Mancell who died 
                                                testate on 14 August 1987. She 
                                                bequeathed the Institute to her 
                                                five children. After the 
                                                necessary probate had been 
                                                taken, vesting assent was given 
                                                to the children. One of the 
                                                children was Elizabeth Mansa 
                                                Mancell. She died in 1993, 
                                                leaving behind three children by 
                                                name Josephine Akita, Francisca 
                                                Hammond and Ronald Renee. The 
                                                three children took over the 
                                                interest of Elizabeth Mansa 
                                                Mancell in the estate. In this 
                                                application, Josephine Akita 
                                                describes herself as the 
                                                applicant, the administratrix of 
                                                the estate of the deceased 
                                                Elizabeth Mansa Mancell and 
                                                representative of herself and 
                                                the two children (as appearing 
                                                in the suit she brought earlier 
                                                in the High Court).In 2006, an 
                                                agreement was allegedly reached 
                                                to sell the Institute. It was 
                                                eventually bought by the Ghana 
                                                Government through the Ministry 
                                                of Children and Women&#8217;s&#8217; 
                                                Affairs. After the purchase 
                                                price had been agreed upon, the 
                                                children took action to request 
                                                the Government to issue five 
                                                separate cheques for the benefit 
                                                of the five children. In that 
                                                action, the children of 
                                                Elizabeth Mansa Mancell were 
                                                represented by Josephine Akita 
                                                the eldest daughter and 
                                                administratrix of her estate. 
                                                When the Government complied 
                                                with the request, the children 
                                                discontinued the action. In 
                                                December 2008, the applicant 
                                                took action in the Human Rights 
                                                Division of the High Court to 
                                                nullify the sale for the sole 
                                                reason that it was concluded 
                                                without the knowledge and 
                                                consent of the children of the 
                                                deceased Elizabeth Mansa Mancell. 
                                                It was in that action that the 
                                                applicant described herself as 
                                                the eldest daughter, 
                                                administratrix and 
                                                representative of herself and 
                                                the other two children. The 
                                                respondent is the High Court 
                                                judge who handled the action 
                                                which has culminated in this 
                                                application. The interested 
                                                parties are the other children 
                                                of the late Rosamund Mancell and 
                                                the Ghana government, the 
                                                purchaser of the Institute. In 
                                                the High Court, the applicant 
                                                applied for an interim 
                                                injunction against the 
                                                Government and the interested 
                                                persons in the instant 
                                                application. The trial judge 
                                                dismissed the injunction and the 
                                                entire action. He proceeded to 
                                                order the Government to take 
                                                over the Institute. The 
                                                applicant appealed against the 
                                                decision of the court. She then 
                                                filed a motion to restrain the 
                                                interested parties from acting 
                                                in any manner inconsistent with 
                                                the applicants&#8217; beneficial 
                                                interest in the Institute. The 
                                                motion was predicated on the 
                                                appeal filed against the 
                                                decision of High Court. The 
                                                return date for the motion was 
                                                11 November 2009. On the 10 
                                                November, the High Court 
                                                registrar served Form 6 on the 
                                                applicant. Counsel for the 
                                                applicant took the view that 
                                                since Form 6 had been served, 
                                                the Court of Appeal was seised 
                                                of the case and that the High 
                                                Court had no jurisdiction over 
                                                the matter. The High Court judge 
                                                ruled that he had jurisdiction 
                                                and dismissed the application 
                                                for injunction. A writ of 
                                                possession was issued in favour 
                                                of the interested parties. The 
                                                applicant thereafter applied to 
                                                this court for an order of 
                                                certiorari to quash the last 
                                                decision of the High Court for 
                                                two reasons: Firstly that the 
                                                High Court judge had no

                                                further that an affidavit filed 
                                                by the interested party was not 
                                                served on the applicant before

												By its writ herein, issued on 
												April 04, 2001, the Plaintiff 
												sought, inter alia, the 
												following reliefs:&quot;1. A 
												declaration that the former 
												President of the Republic, Flt. 
												Lt. Jerry John Rawlings is 
												entitled to all the facilities 
												available to him as President 
												and such facilities including

												shall be varied without his 
												consent during his lifetime. 3. 
												An injunction restraining the 
												Defendant and the government it

												varying the facilities available

												Rawlings during his lifetime as

												This is an appeal against the 
												striking out of an appeal and 
												failure to relist same by the 
												Court of appeal.&nbsp; The facts 
												which appear to be simple are 
												that the appellant was a 
												Co-defendant in a case which was 
												heard before the High Court, 
												Tema.&nbsp; The judgment in the case 
												was delivered on 11/10/2001 and 
												the appellant who felt aggrieved 
												by the judgment filed an appeal 
												on the 2/11/2001.&nbsp; As enjoined 
												by procedural rules of the 
												court, the appellant and the 
												respondent herein were invited 
												by the registrar of the High 
												Court to settle records for the 
												appeal.&nbsp; The parties herein did 
												not appear before the registrar 
												of the Tema High Court on 21<sup>st</sup> 
												of January 2005 to settle the 
												records by themselves.&nbsp; The 
												solicitor for the respondent, 
												however, wrote a letter to the 
												registrar and listed the 
												documents and evidence which he 
												wanted to constitute the record 
												for the purposes of the appeal.&nbsp; 
												The appellant&#8217;s solicitor sent a

												Property - Recovery of 
												possession &#8211; Contempt - Stay of 
												execution -</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
												The facts of the instant case 
												are that the Applicants 
												(hereinafter referred to as the 
												Defendants) had judgment entered 
												against them in the Circuit 
												Court on the 21st of October, 
												1999. The Court ordered them to 
												give up possession of a house to 
												the Interested Parties in these 
												proceedings (hereinafter 
												referred to as the Plaintiffs). 
												The Defendants, dissatisfied 
												with the judgment and 
												consequential orders, filed an 
												appeal to the Court of Appeal on 
												the 28th day of October, 1999 
												and then followed this with an 
												application for stay of 
												execution pending an appeal. 
												This application was filed on 
												29th October, 1999. Meanwhile, 
												the Plaintiffs, also on the same 
												day, applied ex-parte, for a 
												writ of possession to enable 
												them recover possession of the 
												house as decreed in the 
												judgment. Pursuant to the writ 
												for recovery of possession, the 
												Deputy Sheriff effected the 
												ejectment of the Defendants. But 
												believing, to use their own 
												words, that &quot;the exercise was 
												unlawful as having been carried 
												out when the motion for stay of 
												execution pending appeal... had 
												not been heard&quot; the Defendants 
												adopted self-help and reinstated 
												themselves in the house from 
												which they had earlier been 
												ejected by the Deputy Sheriff. 
												The Plaintiff then cited the 
												Defendants in the High Court for 
												contempt. The High Court found 
												the Defendants guilty but 
												adjourned to two weeks for 
												sentence. Though it is not clear 
												from the record, we feel this 
												adjournment could have been 
												intended to give the Defendants 
												a chance to purge themselves. 
												However they rather chose to 
												apply to this Court for an order 
												of certiorari and prohibition to 
												first quash the ruling of the 
												High Court dated 10th July, 2000 
												convicting them of contempt and 
												secondly to prohibit the said 
												Court from proceeding to 
												sentence them. The ground urged 
												on behalf of this application 
												was that there was an error of 
												law apparent on the face of the 
												record. The error cited was that 
												the writ of recovery of 
												possession ought not to have 
												been made in view of the 
												pendency of the motion for stay 
												of execution pending appeal.- <b>

												Property - Recovery of 
												possession &#8211; Contempt - Stay of 
												execution -</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
												The facts of the instant case 
												are that the Applicants 
												(hereinafter referred to as the 
												Defendants) had judgment entered 
												against them in the Circuit 
												Court on the 21st of October, 
												1999. The Court ordered them to 
												give up possession of a house to 
												the Interested Parties in these 
												proceedings (hereinafter 
												referred to as the Plaintiffs). 
												The Defendants, dissatisfied 
												with the judgment and 
												consequential orders, filed an 
												appeal to the Court of Appeal on 
												the 28th day of October, 1999 
												and then followed this with an 
												application for stay of 
												execution pending an appeal. 
												This application was filed on 
												29th October, 1999. Meanwhile, 
												the Plaintiffs, also on the same 
												day, applied ex-parte, for a 
												writ of possession to enable 
												them recover possession of the 
												house as decreed in the 
												judgment. Pursuant to the writ 
												for recovery of possession, the 
												Deputy Sheriff effected the 
												ejectment of the Defendants. But 
												believing, to use their own 
												words, that &quot;the exercise was 
												unlawful as having been carried 
												out when the motion for stay of 
												execution pending appeal... had 
												not been heard&quot; the Defendants 
												adopted self-help and reinstated 
												themselves in the house from 
												which they had earlier been 
												ejected by the Deputy Sheriff. 
												The Plaintiff then cited the 
												Defendants in the High Court for 
												contempt. The High Court found 
												the Defendants guilty but 
												adjourned to two weeks for 
												sentence. Though it is not clear 
												from the record, we feel this 
												adjournment could have been 
												intended to give the Defendants 
												a chance to purge themselves. 
												However they rather chose to 
												apply to this Court for an order 
												of certiorari and prohibition to 
												first quash the ruling of the 
												High Court dated 10th July, 2000 
												convicting them of contempt and 
												secondly to prohibit the said 
												Court from proceeding to 
												sentence them. The ground urged 
												on behalf of this application 
												was that there was an error of 
												law apparent on the face of the 
												record. The error cited was that 
												the writ of recovery of 
												possession ought not to have 
												been made in view of the 
												pendency of the motion for stay 
												of execution pending appeal.- <b>

                                                Plaintiff. The plaintiff visited 
                                                Ghana in or about 1988, met the

                                                they subsequently became friends 
                                                with the latter introducing the

                                                defendant. This friendship grew 
                                                in leaps and bounds with the 
                                                plaintiff accepting an 
                                                invitation to lodge and reside 
                                                with the defendants anytime she 
                                                visited Ghana thereafter. It 
                                                must be noted that, the 
                                                Defendants, were by then 
                                                residing in rented premises and 
                                                the Plaintiff had made it known 
                                                to the defendants that she had 
                                                planned to relocate to Ghana and 
                                                make it her home. Plaintiff 
                                                thereafter resided with the 
                                                Defendants anytime she visited 
                                                Ghana and with the passage of 
                                                time the Plaintiff and 1<sup>st</sup> 
                                                defendant fell in love. 
                                                According to the facts on 
                                                record, the 1<sup>st</sup> 
                                                defendant then proposed to marry 
                                                the plaintiff at the Cape Coast 
                                                Municipal Assembly. Even though 
                                                this marriage ceremony never 
                                                took place, the relationship 
                                                between the parties grew 
                                                stronger with the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
                                                defendant not showing any signs 
                                                of rivalry and jealousy as women 
                                                are by nature bound to show. 
                                                According to the plaintiff, she 
                                                was convinced by the defendants 
                                                to provide funds for the 
                                                construction of a house on a 
                                                vacant plot of land belonging to 
                                                the defendants. The plaintiff 
                                                obliged and appears to have 
                                                contributed substantially to the 
                                                construction of the house on 
                                                this land.When the house was 
                                                barely completed, the plaintiff 
                                                moved into occupation later 
                                                followed by defendants with the 
                                                plaintiff virtually occupying 
                                                the first floor of the house and 
                                                the defendants the ground floor. 
                                                Even though the defendants 
                                                dispute the substantial 
                                                contributions of the plaintiff 
                                                towards the construction of the 
                                                house, they did not take steps 
                                                to prevent the plaintiff from 
                                                either occupying the house 
                                                altogether or the almost 50% 
                                                sharing of the occupancy.The 
                                                Plaintiff later brought her 
                                                daughter from the United States 
                                                of America to reside with the 
                                                defendant&#8217;s in Ghana and 
                                                provided a bus which was run 
                                                commercially by the 1<sup>st</sup> 
                                                defendant who was reputed to 
                                                have rendered accounts to the 
                                                plaintiff anytime she returned 
                                                from the United States of 
                                                America to Ghana.Matters soon 
                                                got out of hand and it became 
                                                increasingly clear that the

												Property - Ownership -

												</b>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is an appeal against the 
												unanimous judgment of the Court 
												of Appeal dated 14th December, 
												2000 affirming an award made by 
												the trial High Court at Kumasi 
												on 22nd January, 1999. This High 
												Court Judge made the award 
												pursuant to his own previous 
												order for the valuation and 
												sharing of the assets and 
												liabilities of a school owned 
												jointly by the parties. The 
												appellant contends that the 
												properties of the school had not 
												been &#8220;professionally or 
												otherwise valued&#8221; before the 
												award was made by the High Court 
												and that the Court of Appeal was 
												wrong in affirming the said 
												award. The dispute between the 
												parties was primarily about the 
												ownership of a school 
												established in Kwadaso, Kumasi, 
												in the Ashanti Region and called 
												the Minnesota International 
												School. It was originally 
												established by four men in 1982. 
												In 1984, two of the four 
												founders decided to quit, and 
												the parties herein were left to 
												run the school as joint owners. 
												The plaintiff in the suit is the 
												appellant before us and the 
												defendant is the respondent. I 
												shall hereafter refer to them as 
												Appellant and Respondent. They 
												were the two left behind to run 
												the school. They entered into a 
												partnership agreement and 
												registered the school in their 
												joint names as owners.The 
												appellant became the Headmaster 
												of the school, and the 
												Respondent took the office of 
												Financial/Administrative 
												manager, up to 1992. Troubles 
												started in about 1992 when, 
												according to the appellant, the 
												respondent refused to render 
												accounts and claimed to be the 
												sole owner of the school. When 
												matters came to a head, the 
												appellant sued the respondent on 
												10th May, 1994 at the High Court 
												in Kumasi, claiming a 
												&#8220;declaration that the plaintiff 
												and the defendant jointly own&#8221; 
												the school.- <b>

												Looking at the Statement of 
												Claim (as amended on 24th July, 
												1998, pursuant to leave granted 
												on 13th July, 1998), the main 
												thrust of the Appellant&#8217;s case 
												was that he purchased the 
												property from its previous 
												owner, Unilever Ghana Limited, 
												who, after the sale, by a letter 
												dated 29th December 1995, 
												informed the Respondent of the 
												transfer of ownership and 
												requested him to attorned 
												tenancy to the Appellant. 
												According to the Appellant, the 
												Respondent duly attorned tenancy 
												to him by paying rent up to 30th 
												July 1996. However, since 1st 
												July 1996, the Respondent had 
												continued to occupy the premises 
												without paying any rent, despite 
												the Appellant&#8217;s repeated demands 
												for rent. Also according to the 
												Appellant, the rent at the time 
												the Respondent attorned tenancy 
												to him was the Cedi equivalent 
												of $2,125.00 per month.By his 
												Statement of Defence, the 
												Respondent contended that the 
												sale of the property was a sham 
												and he, therefore, denied that 
												the appellant is the owner of 
												the property. He, however, 
												admitted in paragraph 4 that he 
												is the tenant of the premises as 
												averred in paragraph 2 of the 
												Statement of Claim. It appears 
												to us that the key portions of 
												the Statement of Defence are 
												paragraphs 3 and 5-9, which read 
												as follows<b>:&#8212;

												<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">
												The Plaintiff/ Respondent was 
												the original owner of the 
												subject matter of this appeal; 
												House No. 270/9, Accra New Town. 
												Unfortunately, it was sold by 
												public auction at the instance 
												of the Accra City Council in 
												August 1987 and bought by one 
												Odartey Lamptey (PW2). But 
												thereafter, he sold the 
												property, (so he thought), to 
												the Respondent after he had been 
												paid an amount of C1800 
												representing the cost of the 
												auction price and other 
												incidental expenses he alleged 
												he had incurred. His story is 
												that he was moved by the tearful 
												pleas of the Respondent, the 
												original owner and his family to 
												relinquish his interest in the 
												property. The repayment to him 
												was not effected by the 
												Respondent alone, but with the 
												full participation of the 
												Appellants and their witness, 
												DW2.The puzzle which our courts 
												have been trying to unravel for 
												the past nineteen years is; who 
												actually bought this property? 
												Was it the Respondent, or the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Appellant for the simple reason 
												that, oddly, both parties are 
												now laying claim to it? While 
												the Respondent contends that he 
												borrowed money from the 1st 
												Appellant&#8217;s father to redeem the 
												property for himself, with the 
												clear understanding that the 
												lender collects the rents and 
												uses it to defray the loan, and 
												clearly therefore in 
												circumstances that amount to a 
												pledge, the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Appellant on the other hand 
												maintains that the transaction 
												between herself and the 
												Respondent was not a pledge, but 
												an outright sale of the property 
												to her, with the original owner 
												only serving as the conduit. The 
												Respondent maintains that he was 
												compelled by the Appellants&#8217; 
												failure to account for all rents 
												collected, to institute this 
												action in 1988 (1) to recover 
												possession of the house and (2) 
												for an order of account of all 
												rents collected from January 
												1970 to the date of judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												Both the trial and appellate 
												courts determined the principal 
												issue of whether the transaction 
												between the parties was a pledge 
												or an outright sale in the 
												Respondent&#8217;s favour - </span><b>

												The

												(who are subsequently referred

												administrators of the Estate of 
												the late Opanyin Yaw Koranteng 
												of Asamankese, while the 
												Defendant is the son of the late 
												Opanyin Kwame Addo of Agona 
												Swedru, an uterine brother of 
												the said Opanyin Koranteng.&nbsp; The 
												brothers were from Abetiti, 
												Kwahu, but had settled in 
												Asamankese and Agona Swedru 
												respectively to carry on their 
												business of trading.The 
												conflicting evidence relates to 
												the purchase of a particular 
												piece of real estate in Agona 
												Swedru from the United Africa 
												Company.&nbsp; A Deed of Assignment 
												relating to the transaction was 
												executed between the late Yaw 
												Koranteng and the UAC on 29<sup>th</sup> 
												May 1972 and registered in the 
												Deeds Registry (See Exhibit B at 
												p.116 of the Record).&nbsp; Before 
												the execution of the Deed, 
												however, there was evidence 
												showing that Opanyin Kwame Addo 
												had made the initial contact 
												with UAC and that the receipt 
												for the purchase price of NC 
												9,000 issued by UAC in respect 
												of the property had been issued 
												in his name on 20<sup>th</sup> 
												September 1971 (See Exhibit 1A 
												at p. 118 of the Record).&nbsp; A 
												letter from the Acting Eastern 
												Region Properties Manager of the 
												UAC, dated 3<sup>rd</sup> 
												September, 1971 (Exhibit 1B, at 
												p. 119 of the Record), which is 
												addressed to Mr. Kwame Addo of 
												Agona Swedru, refers to his 
												offer of NC 9,000 and indicates 
												that it is receiving favourable 
												consideration.&nbsp; On 14<sup>th</sup> 
												September, 1971 the Ghana 
												Properties Manager of UAC wrote 
												to Mr. Kwame Addo, accepting , 
												subject to contract, his offer 
												to purchase the property in 
												question for NC9,000. (See 
												Exhibit 1D at p. 121 of the 
												Record).&nbsp; There is other 
												correspondence also on record 
												which confirms that the actual 
												negotiation resulting in the 
												sale of the Agona Swedru 
												property to Mr. Koranteng was 
												carried out by Mr. Kwame Addo. 
												The Plaintiffs&#8217; case was that 
												Opanyin Koranteng owned the 
												Agona Swedru property and that 
												the Deed of Assignment was 
												binding proof of that fact.&nbsp; 
												However, after the purchase of 
												the property, he had authorised 
												his elder brother, Opanyin Kwame 
												Addo, who was resident locally 
												in Agona Swedru to take care of 
												the property on his behalf.&nbsp; 
												Opanyin Addo had been authorised 
												to collect rents from the 
												tenants on the land, to use some 
												and to account for the rest to 
												Opanyin Yaw Koranteng&nbsp; Also. 
												Kwame Addo, with the permission 
												of his brother Yaw Koranteng, 
												had been permitted to occupy 
												some of the stores in the Swedru 
												property without paying any 
												rents, in view of his services 
												to Yaw Koranteng.&nbsp; However, 
												after the death of the two 
												brothers, the Defendant, son of

												The

												31).&nbsp; That Decree did not

												its business.&nbsp; The confiscated

												continued running the business 
												on Plot No. 19. The business was

												several times to that end.&nbsp;

												The facts relied on by parties 
												to establish their respective 
												cases were not complicated. The 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s case was that S.K. 
												Opoku the deceased, was his 
												uncle. He was a trader at Akuse 
												in the Eastern Region. He stayed 
												with him at Akuse as a young man 
												and worked in one of his stores. 
												After some time his uncle gifted 
												one of his stores at Akuse to 
												him. Not long after that, his 
												uncle decided to move from Akuse 
												to Accra. The Plaintiff, 
												however, remained at Akuse and 
												worked in his store. In 1968, 
												the Plaintiff&#8217;s said&nbsp; uncle 
												invited him to Accra and 
												informed him that his church, 
												the True Faith Church, had 
												acquired land from the Alajo 
												chief which had been partitioned 
												and was being allocated to 
												members of the church. The 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s uncle told him he 
												had wanted to pass it on to his 
												brother, Osei Kwaku but Osei 
												declined the offer. A similar 
												offer was made to the deceased&#8217;s 
												sister (the Plaintiff&#8217;s aunt), 
												Amma Mansah but she also 
												declined to have it. 
												Consequently, the deceased had 
												decided to surrender this land 
												to the Plaintiff. This 
												discussion, the Plaintiff 
												claimed, was held in the 
												presence of Osei and Amma Mansah. 
												The Plaintiff accepted the land 
												in their presence. The 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s case was that he 
												paid about ¢800.00 to his 
												deceased uncle to pay for the 
												cost of the land and 
												subsequently sent or gave 
												various sums to him to supervise 
												the building of a house on the 
												land for him. The uncle 
												supervised the construction of 
												the &#8220;Boys Quarters&#8221; and the 
												first floor of the building. In 
												or about 1979, the Plaintiff&#8217;s 
												uncle, S.K. Opoku, became unwell 
												and decided to go back to his 
												hometown, Obo, in the Kwahu 
												Traditional Area. At that time 
												the building had not been 
												completed but his uncle was 
												living on the first floor. The 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s case that his 
												deceased uncle called him to 
												Accra and told him of his 
												decision to re-locate to Obo. He 
												suggested to the Plaintiff to 
												approach an elder of the church, 
												Opanin Joseph, to supervise the 
												erection of the remaining floors 
												of the house for him. Later, the 
												Plaintiff himself came to live 
												in Accra. At that time the 
												second floor had been completed 
												and he settled in it. He took 
												over the supervision from Opanin 
												Joseph. In due course, the 
												building was completed. The 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s uncle, S.K. Opoku 
												died in 1984. The Plaintiff 
												continued to live in the house 
												without let or hindrance until 
												1989 when the first defendant 
												(or one of her daughters) 
												approached him and begged that 
												her mother be given one room in 
												the house for her use. The 
												Plaintiff turned down the 
												request so the Plaintiff&#8217;s 
												uncle, Osei Kwaku, was 
												approached to intercede on her 
												behalf. Still he refused her a 
												room. The Defendants reported 
												the Plaintiff to the CDR 
												alleging that he was occupying 
												their father&#8217;s (or husband&#8217;s) 
												house and had refused to give to 
												the first defendant one room to 
												live in. By various threats and 
												stratagems the CDR, made an 
												interim order (against the 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s will) whereby the 
												first defendant was settled in 
												one room in the house with the 
												excuse that there were vacant 
												rooms in the house. It was on 
												account of these matters that he 
												instituted the present action 
												against the defendants.- <b>

												</span></b>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The facts giving rise to the 
												litigation are as follows: The 
												case concerns a house which was 
												originally owned by one Mark 
												George Okai. He died intestate 
												on 17<sup>th</sup> September 
												1939, leaving behind male and 
												female children. On his death, 
												letters of administration were 
												granted to William George Okai, 
												his eldest son, and Samuel 
												Adotei Brown, his nephew. Both 
												died later. On 14<sup>th</sup> 
												August 1945, two daughters of 
												Mark G Okai entered into a lease 
												agreement with Nicholas Timothy 
												Clerk in respect of that house. 
												The house was leased to the 
												latter for sixty years at a 
												yearly rental of sixty pounds 
												commencing from 1<sup>st</sup> 
												August 1945. The lessee paid 
												seven hundred and fifty pounds 
												on execution of the lease and 
												another seven hundred and fifty 
												pounds, the latter being 
												one-half of the children&#8217;s 
												share. The children&#8217;s share was 
												later returned to the lessee and 
												was never repaid by him. By 
												calculation, the lessee paid 
												rent from 1<sup>st</sup> August 
												1945 to 30<sup>th</sup> April 
												1964 which amounted to eighteen 
												years and nine months. In spite 
												of the execution of the lease, 
												some of the children of Mark G. 
												Okai remained in occupation of 
												the house and even collected 
												rents from some tenants. The 
												lessee took action against those 
												children, claiming two hundred 
												pounds as damages for trespass, 
												an order of ejectment and refund 
												of rents collected by them. He 
												obtained judgment against them. 
												The co-defendants in that case 
												appealed to the West African 
												Court of Appeal (WACA). The 
												appeal failed. The WACA judgment 
												ordered the lessee, at his own 
												expense, to obtain planning 
												permit, pull down the existing 
												structure and construct an 
												entirely new building in its 
												place. He failed to comply with 
												that order. He also failed to 
												pay rent from May 1964. In June 
												1983, the surviving children of 
												the late Mark Okai sued the 
												lessee for one thousand one 
												hundred and forty five pounds 
												being rent arrears for 229 
												months from 1<sup>st</sup> May 
												1964 to 1<sup>st</sup> May 1983, 
												mesne profits and forfeiture of 
												the lease for breach of covenant 
												to pay rent and non compliance 
												with the order of WACA already 
												referred to. For convenience, 
												those children will be referred 
												to as the plaintiffs and the 
												original defendant will be 
												referred to as N. T. Clerk for 
												short. - <b>

												The Plaintiff avers that she is

												on behalf of her said maternal

												the late Kwabena Asante alias 
												Kwabena Dan, her granduncle. 
												That late Kwabena Asante was one 
												of the four children of her 
												great grand mother the late

												lived at Old Ampabame in 
												Kumasi.It is her case that the 
												Old Ampabame Township was 
												relocated from its old site to 
												its present site, to give way to 
												the Owabi head-works. The then 
												Gold Coast Government paid a 
												compensation of £30 to each 
												household for each house lost as 
												a result of the re-location. 
												Unspecified sums of money were 
												also paid as compensation for 
												each farm lost. Plaintiff&nbsp; 
												alleges further that the late 
												Kwabena&nbsp; Asante&nbsp; received the 
												compensation paid for their 
												family house at Ampabame, as 
												well as the&nbsp; unspecified sums of 
												money paid for the&nbsp; cocoa farm 
												of the late Kojo Mosi the then

												Asante as compensation for the

												farm that Kwabena Asante applied 
												to the building of the disputed 
												house. The defendants denied the 
												plaintiff&#8217;s capacity and her 
												claim that the house in dispute 
												is her maternal family property. 
												For their part it is their case 
												that no compensation was paid to 
												any household for any house lost 
												and that Kwabena Asante did not 
												receive any compensation on 
												behalf of the plaintiff&#8217;s

												recover all rent arrears and 
												ejectment from the house in

												case of the respondent that he 
												owned the property in dispute 
												and leased same to the appellant 
												for an agreed rent.&nbsp; According 
												to the Appellant, the respondent 
												ceased paying rent in 1999.&nbsp; He 
												therefore commenced the action 
												for recovery of possession and 
												rent arrears.The appellant 
												controverted the facts and 
												strongly denied the title of the 
												respondent.&nbsp; He stated among 
												other things that there was an 
												agreement he entered into with 
												the respondent and one Quartey 
												Papafio to travel abroad in 
												exchange for the house in

												that the agreement divested the

												The plaintiff claimed the

												Number 49E/12, Nima, until it 
												was sold to the late deceased 
												Madam Axorlushie Zomade. By a 
												deed between Madam Zomade and

												April 1997, the defendant 
												assigned the residue of the 
												expired term of her leasehold in 
												the house aforementioned, to 
												Madam Zomade for ¢13m (thirteen 
												million cedis), and handed over 
												title deeds on the house to her. 
												As part of the sale agreement, 
												the &nbsp;&nbsp;defendant was to be 
												permitted to continue staying in 
												the house for three years after 
												the sale. Further, a son of 
												Madam Zomade would also come to 
												stay in the house. Madam Zomade 
												indicated she was going to pull 
												down the whole house and build 
												stores on the land and give them 
												to the defendant on rental 
												basis. The son has since then 
												been staying in the house. On 
												the death of Madam Zomade on 19<sup>th</sup>

												an order of stay of execution of 
												the judgment dated 9th May, 2001 
												and (ii) an order setting aside

												May, 2001, which ordered

												date of payment; (iii) they also

												make that order void.The 
												plaintiff-respondent has raised 
												a preliminary objection to the 
												application, contending that the 
												application &quot;is misconceived as 
												it is not sanctioned by any 
												rules of the Supreme Court.&quot; The 
												facts: In 1991 the plaintiff 
												obtained judgment at the High 
												Court for the sum of 
												¢74,071,000.00 being the balance 
												outstanding on the value of 
												goods sold by the plaintiff to 
												the defendants. The action was 
												initially against the defendants 
												only. The defendants denied the 
												claim and alleged that it was 
												the co-defendants who bought the 
												goods; they therefore joined the 
												co-defendants. The trial High 
												Court's judgment was against the 
												defendants and co-defendants 
												jointly and severally. For 
												various reasons, all the three 
												parties &#8212; the plaintiff, the 
												defendants and the 
												co-defendants-appealed to the 
												Court of Appeal. The Court of 
												Appeal set aside the High Court 
												judgment on grounds that it was 
												against the weight of evidence, 
												and entered judgment against the 
												co-defendants alone as being 
												liable to the plaintiffs claim. 
												The plaintiff and co-defendants 
												appealed to the Supreme Court 
												against that judgment and on 9th 
												May, 2001 the Supreme Court 
												allowed the appeal, set aside 
												the Court of Appeal judgment, 
												and entered judgment for 
												plaintiff against the defendants 
												and absolved the co-defendants 
												from any liability. The court 
												awarded the sum of 
												¢74,071,000.00 against the 
												defendants jointly and severally 
												with interest at the current 
												bank rate from 1st May, 1990 to 
												the date of payment. The 
												Defendants react: The defendants 
												immediately applied for a review 
												of the judgment but did not 
												contest the award of interest in 
												the review.&nbsp; The court dismissed 
												the review application. In 
												answer to the plaintiff&#8217;s 
												objection that the application 
												is not properly before the court 
												the defendants contend that they 
												are properly before the court by 
												virtue of the provisions of Rule

												<b>&nbsp;Interest - Setting aside</b> 
												- In this application the 
												defendants/judgment Debtors are 
												asking the Court to grant them (i) 
												an order of stay of execution of 
												the judgment dated 9th May, 2001 
												and (ii) an order setting aside 
												part of that judgment of 9th 
												May, 2001, which ordered 
												interest on the judgment debt 
												awarded against them at the 
												prevailing bank rate until the 
												date of payment; (iii) they also 
												seek an order substituting a new 
												order for interest on the 
												judgment debt at 4% after 
												judgment till the date of 
												payment. The applicants are of 
												the view that the order for 
												interest was wrong and even void 
												and must, therefore, be set 
												aside. I do not see what could 
												make that order void. The facts: 
												In 1991 the plaintiff obtained 
												judgment at the High Court for 
												the sum of ø74,071,000.00 being 
												the balance outstanding on the 
												value of goods sold by the 
												plaintiff to the defendants. The 
												action was initially against the 
												defendants only. The defendants 
												denied the claim and alleged 
												that it was the co-defendants 
												who bought the goods; they 
												therefore joined the 
												co-defendants. The trial High 
												Court&#8217;s judgment was against the 
												defendants and co-defendants 
												jointly and severally. For 
												various reasons, all the three 
												parties &#8211; the plaintiff, the 
												defendants and the 
												co-defendants-appealed to the 
												Court of Appeal. The Court of 
												Appeal set aside the High Court 
												judgment on grounds that it was 
												against the weight of evidence, 
												and entered judgment against the 
												co-defendants alone as being 
												liable to the plaintiff&#8217;s claim. 
												The plaintiff and co-defendants 
												appealed to the Supreme Court 
												against that judgment and on 9th 
												May, 2001 the Supreme Court 
												allowed the appeal, set aside 
												the Court of Appeal judgment, 
												and entered judgment for 
												plaintiff against the defendants 
												and absolved the co-defendants 
												from any liability. The court 
												awarded the sum of 
												ø74,071,000.00 against the 
												defendants jointly and severally 
												with interest at the current 
												bank rate from 1st May, 1990 to 
												the date of payment.The 
												Defendants react:&nbsp; The 
												defendants immediately applied 
												for a review of the judgment but 
												did not contest the award of 
												interest in the review. The 
												court dismissed the review 
												application. <b>

												As the facts of this case show 
												and as the two lower courts 
												rightly found, in the lifetime 
												of Moses Neequaye there was no 
												adverse claim by the father of 
												the defendant to the property in 
												dispute. On the death of Moses, 
												the plaintiffs found that 
												Clifford Cudjoe, the appellant&#8217;s 
												father, had tried to gain access 
												to the house through fraudulent 
												means, but this was scuttled 
												when the property was documented 
												in the name of Dina Dei Neequaye 
												on the insistence of her 
												sibblings. Thereafter Clifford 
												caved in, accepted his fate and 
												only continued living in the 
												house as licensee of the 
												respondents. Therefore, the only 
												time an adverse claim was made 
												in respect of the property was 
												after the death of Dina Neequaye 
												in 1980 when, on the instigation 
												of Seth Neequaye, the defendants 
												and her sibblings started to

												- This is an appeal from the 
												Judgment of the Stool Lands 
												Boundaries Settlement Commission 
												Appeal Tribunal delivered at 
												Accra on the 21st day of May 
												1992. The said Judgment stemmed 
												from an appeal from the decision 
												of the Stool Lands Boundaries 
												Settlement Commission (Coram 
												E.T.C. Amorin) given on 5th 
												February 1988. A boundary 
												dispute between the Fijai stool 
												and Effia Stool was referred to 
												the Commissioner of the Stool 
												Lands Boundary Settlement 
												Commission for trial by Mr. 
												Justice F.T.C. Amorin.At the 
												hearing both stools were ordered 
												to file survey instructions in 
												addition to the pleadings. Fijai 
												stool complied but Effia stool 
												failed to file its survey 
												instructions and offered no 
												explanation. Evidence was taken 
												and concluded and the trial 
												Commissioner gave judgment 
												wherein he held that:&quot;the 
												evidence led by Fijai stool is 
												more convincing and 
												acceptable..... I am more 
												impressed by the evidence of 
												Fijai stool and accept same.&quot;The 
												Commissioner then continued to 
												demarcate the boundary between 
												Fijai and Effia stools and 
												ordered the drawing up of a 
												survey plan accordingly.The 
												Effia Stool appealed this 
												decision of the Commissioner to 
												the Appeal Tribunal which 
												dismissed the appeal. 
												Dissatisfied the Appellant 
												herein filed another appeal to 
												this court. The original ground 
												of appeal was &quot;That the judgment 
												is against the weight of 
												evidence adduced at the trial.&quot; 
												Additional grounds of Appeal

                                                plaintiff. She based her claim 
                                                of ownership of the 212 acres of

                                                commenced its commercial farming

                                                resulted in the total

                                                According to the 1<sup>st</sup> 
                                                defendant, the plaintiff who is

                                                Traditional Council confirms his

                                              grounds that the damages awarded 
                                              were too punitive and the costs

												Stool Land - Recovery of

												<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">
												Declaration of title to all that 
												land situate, lying and being at 
												New Weija-Accra and containing 
												an approximate area of 95.194 
												acres more or less and bounded 
												on the Northwest by a proposed 
												road measuring 2891.70 feet more 
												or less, on the Northeast by a 
												proposed road measuring 2656.39 
												feet more or less, on the 
												Southeast by Weija lands 
												measuring 1889.36 feet more or 
												less and on the Southwest by 
												Weija lands measuring 2068.55 
												more or less. Plaintiff&#8217;s case 
												is that its Managing Director 
												had acquired a large swathe of 
												land from the Weija stool by way 
												of customary grant in or about 
												1980. He immediately went into 
												possession by clearing the land 
												and erecting boundary 
												pillars.1998, when Plaintiff was 
												incorporated, its Managing 
												Director requested the stool, 
												acting by its Chief Nii Anto 
												Nyame II that the documents in 
												respect of the land be made out 
												in the name of the Plaintiff 
												Company. It is also the case of 
												Plaintiff Company that a 
												cadastral plan prepared by the 
												Government to delineate the 
												precise boundaries of the stool 
												and family lands of Weija 
												clearly defined Plaintiff&#8217;s land 
												in the plan, except it was 
												marked as &#8220;FAK&#8221; instead of &#8220;FKA&#8221; 
												It was Plaintiff&#8217;s further 
												contention that its grantor, the 
												Weija Stool had had its title 
												confirmed in various judgments 
												e.g.&nbsp; Manche Anege Akwei v 
												Manche Kojo Ababio IV (Accra 
												Water Works Acquisition) dated 
												24<sup>th</sup> July 1948 and 
												another judgment of the Full 
												Court dated 1924. Further, that 
												various portions of the land 
												acquired for public use by the 
												then Gold Coast Government paid 
												compensation to the Weija Stool 
												and no one else. Plaintiff says 
												the Defendant has illegally 
												entered onto portions of its 
												land and causing damage and loss 
												to Plaintiff consequently 
												necessitating the Writ and

												The Appellant contended that 
												because of the history of the 
												Fahiakobo lands he was entitled 
												to collect revenues from those 
												lands.&nbsp; This history was in 
												short as follows: historically, 
												in Bekwai the sub-stools are 
												ordinarily in charge of stool 
												land.&nbsp; However, in the case of 
												Fahiakobo, as a result of the 
												settlement of a boundary dispute 
												between two sub-stools of Bekwai 
												over certain lands, it was 
												decided that the Bekwai Stool 
												should take direct charge of the 
												Fahiakobo lands, since these 
												lands constituted a small &#8220;no 
												man&#8217;s land&#8221; between the 
												sub-stools after the demarcation 
												of the boundaries between the 
												two contending sub-stools.&nbsp; The 
												Omanhene therefore administers 
												the lands through an Odikro.&nbsp; 
												The trial Circuit Judge found 
												that the Appellant had conceded 
												that the Fahiakobo lands had not 
												lost their identity as stool 
												lands </span>
												<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial judge held that though 
												the allodial title in the 
												Fahiakobo lands was vested in 
												the Bekwai Stool, the 
												Administration of Stool Lands 
												Act 1962 (Act 123) vested powers 
												of administration of the lands 
												in the Administrator of Stool 
												Lands. On 24<sup>th</sup> August 
												1987, the Appellant was 
												arrainged before His Honour 
												Judge Quaye, in the Circuit 
												Court, Kumasi on 13 counts of

                                                was issued but the transaction

                                                for the construction. By his 
                                                claim he sought to recover the 
                                                portion that was not covered by 
                                                the acquisition. On the part of

                                                claimant/respondent, he said he 
                                                entered the land in 1974 when it 
                                                was vacant and has since then 
                                                been in quiet and peaceful

                                                1981 when he approached Nii

                                                he was destooled. In 1986 he

												The facts relevant to this case 
												are that, in the year 1957 Togbe 
												Ayim Darke IV instituted legal 
												action against Togbe Gobo Darke 
												XI of Tsito and one Ntow Peniana, 
												a subject of Tsito, in the Peki 
												Native Court for a declaration 
												of title and damages for 
												trespass to parcels of land 
												known as Awaline Avagah and 
												Tiame. The case was transferred 
												to the High Court, Ho, presided 
												over by Francois J. (as he then 
												was) where the trial commenced 
												before HIM. The High Court gave 
												Judgment in favour of Togbe Ayim 
												Darke IV of Peki on the 11<sup>th</sup> 
												of November 1975. Togbe Gobo 
												Darke XI of Tsito appealed to 
												the Court of Appeal and the 
												Appeal was allowed. There was a 
												further appeal to the Supreme 
												Court which was dismissed. The 
												case appeared to have been 
												legally closed until the 13<sup>th</sup> 
												of July 1987 when Togbe Ayim 
												Darke IV instituted an action in 
												the High Court Accra for a 
												declaration that the Judgement 
												of Francois J in the High Court, 
												Ho, was null and void for want 
												of jurisdiction, and a further 
												order setting aside the 
												Judgement of the Court of Appeal 
												which had affirmed it. It 
												finally applied for an order 
												referring the matter to the 
												Stool Lands boundary Settlement 
												Commission under the Stool Land 
												Boundary Settlement Decree, 1973 
												(NRCD 172). The reliefs were 
												granted by the High Court in 
												Accra, presided over by Omari 
												Sasu J.Togbe Gobo Darke XII and 
												Ntow Peniana of Tsito appealed 
												to the Supreme Court pursuant to 
												leave granted by the Court of 
												Appeal. In the preparation of 
												their case, they run out of time 
												and the case was struck out by 
												the Supreme Court. Togbe Gobo 
												Darke XII then brought an 
												application for certiorari to 
												quash the Judgment of the Accra 
												High Court and all consequential 
												orders made thereunder.&nbsp; The 
												application was granted but it 
												was further ordered that the 
												suit should be sent to the Stool 
												Lands Boundary Settlement 
												Commission.The Awudome stool as 
												overlords of the Tsito stool 
												joined the suit as second 
												claimant . The Peki stool 
												remained the first claimant. 
												Upon the coming into force of 
												the Stool Lands Boundary

												: 1) The Supreme Court has 
												jurisdiction under Article 
												129(4) of the 1992 Constitution 
												and the Courts Act 1993 (Act

												- &#8220;The verdict of the court is 
												that the dismissal of Plaintiff 
												was motivated by factors other

												Supreme Court Rules -</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial">
												<b>Review -&nbsp; </b>The review 
												jurisdiction of the Supreme 
												Court has been conferred by 
												Article 133(1) of the 
												Constitution, which reads as 
												follows: &#8212; The Supreme Court may 
												review any decision made or 
												given by it on such grounds and 
												subject to such conditions as 
												may be prescribed by rules of 
												court.&#8221; Pursuant to this 
												provision, Rule 54 of the 
												Supreme Court Rules, 1996 
												(C.I.16) was enacted to regulate 
												the grounds and conditions under 
												which this power may be invoked. 
												Consequently, this Rule provides 
												as follows:&#8212; The Court may 
												review any decision made or 
												given by it on any of the 
												following grounds &#8212; a. 
												exceptional circumstances which 
												have resulted in a miscarriage 
												of justice; b. discovery of new 
												and important matter or evidence 
												which, after the exercise of due 
												diligence, was not within the 
												applicant's knowledge or could 
												not be produced by him at the 
												time when the decision was 
												given&#8221;. (the emphasis is mine) 
												Clearly, the jurisdiction is 
												restricted to the review of 
												decisions &#8220;made or given by it&#8221;; 
												&#8216;it' being with reference to the 
												Supreme Court.&nbsp; Thus, in an 
												application for review, the only 
												decision under scrutiny must be 
												the decision of the Supreme 
												Court, not the decisions of any 
												prior trial or appellate court 
												or tribunal before whom the case 
												had previously appeared. It is 
												for this reason that, time and 
												again, this court has reiterated 
												that its review jurisdiction is 
												not an appellate one and, 
												therefore, an application for 
												review may not be used as an 
												occasion to repeat an appeal or 
												try-on a new appeal. 
												Furthermore, when exercising its 
												review jurisdiction, it is not 
												the function of the Court to 
												second-guess the Ordinary Bench 
												or to substitute its decision 
												for that of the Ordinary Bench, 
												as though the matter before it 
												is yet another appeal.&nbsp; In an 
												application for review, the 
												Court's power and sole function, 
												particularly where the 
												application is founded on the 
												first ground stipulated by Rule 
												54, is to analyse the decision 
												and the reasoning that led 
												thereto, entirely for the 
												purpose of ascertaining whether 
												or not, indeed, there are 
												demonstrably exceptional 
												circumstances which may, indeed, 
												be said to have resulted in a 
												miscarriage of justice.- <b>

												<b>Review -&nbsp; </b>In the decision 
												I have just read, in Opanin Kojo 
												Fori &amp; Others v. Opanin Kofi 
												Adjei &amp; Another, C.M. 6/98, I 
												set out the parameters guiding 
												the exercise of the Supreme 
												Court's review jurisdiction. In 
												the light of the Court's 
												decision in that case, there is 
												no doubt in my mind that the 
												instant application offends 
												against the rules and principles 
												of review. Since the matter 
												before us is an application for 
												review, rather than appeal, the 
												Court's concern is not with 
												whether or not we agree with the 
												decision of the Ordinary Bench 
												of the Court. Rather, what 
												concerns us, and the only 
												consideration which Rule 54 of 
												the Supreme Court Rules, 1996 
												(C.I.16) permits us to take into 
												account, is whether or not there 
												is any proper ground for us to 
												exercise our review 
												jurisdiction. For the purpose of 
												this application, therefore, the 
												question is whether or not the 
												Applicant has demonstrated any 
												exceptional circumstances 
												connected with the decision, 
												which have resulted in a 
												miscarriage of justice. The most 
												cursory study of the judgment 
												against which this applicant has 
												been brought would reveal that 
												the issues raised by Counsel for 
												the Applicants in his Statement 
												of Case herein are, in 
												substance, the same as those 
												raised before the Ordinary 
												Bench, and Counsel's arguments 
												are no more than a rehash of the 
												Applicant's case in the appeal. 
												These issues were extensively 
												considered in both the minority 
												and the leading majority 
												opinions in the judgment. The 
												fact that the applicants might 
												have a preference for the 
												minority views cannot constitute 
												adequate justification for a 
												review of the judgment.- <b>

												<b>Review - </b>This is an

												<b>Review - </b>This is an 
												application praying this Court 
												to review its judgement given on 
												July 17th, 1999 dismissing the 
												Applicant's appeal. When Rule 54 
												of the Supreme Court Rules, 1996 
												(C.I. 16) was enacted, it was 
												the hope of all that having 
												spelt out, in statutory terms, 
												the only grounds upon which the 
												review jurisdiction of this 
												Court may be exercised, 
												litigants would be duly guided 
												thereby and the previous 
												attempts to use the review 
												jurisdiction as an avenue for a 
												rehearing of lost appeals would 
												cease or, at least, be 
												significantly reduced. 
												Unfortunately this does not 
												appear to be the effect. To make 
												matters worse, it also appears 
												that counsel for losing parties 
												are under the misapprehension 
												that the 'reviewability' of a 
												matter is determined by 
												numerical factors and any 
												decision of the court which is 
												not unanimous must be subject to 
												review. Illustrative of this 
												point is the statement in the 
												Applicant's Statement of Case 
												herein that the application is 
												for:&#8212; &quot;... review of the split 
												decision of the Supreme Court 
												... by a majority of 3-2 ... 
												(and that in this matter) 
												Except... in the National House 
												of Chief where the decision was 
												unanimous in all the other 
												adjudicating bodies which have 
												dealt with this case the 
												decisions have been split, 
												meaning therefore that there may 
												well be very good reasons for 
												reviewing the majority decision 
												of the Supreme Court - <b>

												<b>Review - </b>On July 14th 
												1999, this Court, by a majority 
												decision, dismissed an 
												application, brought by the 
												applicant herein, for the 
												attachment of the 16 Respondents 
												herein for contempt of court. By 
												the instant application, the 
												applicant prays this Court to 
												review its said decision upon 
												the ground that the decision has 
												&#8216;occasioned a grave miscarriage 
												of justice and therefore it is 
												in the interest of justice that 
												the ruling be reviewed'. 
												According to the Statement of 
												Case filed on behalf of the 
												applicant, this contention is 
												based on two grounds, namely 
												that: -1. &quot;the Ruling was given 
												per incuriam for failure to 
												consider the case law and 
												statute law relevant to the 
												application&quot;, and&nbsp; 2. &quot;the 
												applicant's case was not 
												adequately considered.&quot; The 
												power of this Court to review 
												its decisions is governed by 
												Rule 54 of the Supreme Court 
												Rules, 1996 (C.I.16), which 
												stipulates the only grounds upon 
												which we may exercise that 
												power. These grounds are very 
												well known to any assiduous 
												practitioner, however, for ease 
												of reference we set them out in 
												full as follows:&#8212; &#8220;(a) 
												exceptional circumstances which 
												have resulted in a miscarriage 
												of justice;&nbsp; (b) discovery of 
												new and important matter or 
												evidence which, after the 
												exercise of due diligence, was 
												not within the applicant's 
												knowledge or could not be 
												produced by him at the time when 
												the decision was given.&quot; In 
												effect, these limited grounds 
												are no different from those 
												previously prescribed when the 
												power of review was not 
												statutory but, rather, premised 
												on the inherent jurisdiction of 
												the Court. It has been held time 
												and again that the review 
												process must never be viewed or 
												used as a devise for a rehearing 
												of the applicant's case. 
												Therefore, the case of the 
												applicant, in support of an 
												application for review, must 
												clearly establish factors that 
												would justify the application 
												under either of the stipulated 
												grounds.- <b>

												few years before his death Mr 
												Agyekum was taken ill and he 
												spared no effort to regain his 
												health. At this time he appeared 
												to have only one wife, Madam 
												Elizabeth Twene. Her children 
												are the youngest among the 
												deceased&#8217;s children. Mr Agyekum 
												sought treatment in Ghana, 
												Germany and England. He even 
												attended at traditional healers 
												in Ghana and elsewhere, all to 
												no avail. He was accompanied by 
												Madam Elizabeth Twene. 
												Eventually he returned to Ghana 
												on 21<sup>st</sup> May 1985, a 
												very sick man. It was the 
												Respondents&#8217; case in the High 
												Court and of course, throughout 
												these appeals that the deceased 
												suspected the end was near and 
												decided to put his worldly 
												affairs in order. They pleaded 
												that the deceased asked that his 
												solicitor be fetched. His 
												solicitor was Major Brown, a 
												well-known solicitor of the firm 
												of Quist, Brown, Aidoo, Wontumi 
												&amp; Co. The Respondents statement 
												of Defence stated that at the 
												deceased&#8217;s request Major Brown 
												took instructions from him and 
												prepared a will for him which 
												was &#8220;duly executed by him as 
												provided by law.&#8221; Mr Agyekum 
												died on 3<sup>rd</sup> 
												September, 1985. In due course, 
												his will was read at the High 
												Court, Accra. When the Will was 
												read, a number of disappointed 
												beneficiaries took umbrage at 
												its contents so when the 
												executors applied to the High 
												Court for the Will to be proved 
												in common form for it to be 
												admitted to probate, this was 
												opposed by a section of 
												deceased&#8217;s children who promptly 
												filed a caveat against the 
												grant. Ultimately, the 
												Appellants (as Plaintiffs) 
												issued a writ of Summons in the 
												High court, Accra, on 10<sup>th</sup> 
												February 1986 against the 
												executors, Robert Adjan Tackie 
												and Major Brown, claiming:-A 
												declaration that the last will 
												and Testament of William Davies 
												Agyekum deceased, is invalid and 
												of no legal effect and should 
												therefore be set aside.An 
												injunction to restrain the Defs 
												and beneficiaries and/or their 
												assigns, agents and servants 
												from interfering in anyway 
												whatsoever with the properties 
												named in the Will.&#8221;The 
												Respondents (then defendants) 
												denied the averment that the 
												testator&#8217;s will was invalid and 
												pleaded in considerable detail 
												how the will came to be signed 
												by the testator, and who were 
												his attesting witnesses. They 
												counterclaimed against the 
												Plaintiffs jointly and severally 
												for:- A declaration that the 
												paper writing dated 5<sup>th</sup> 
												July 1985 signed by the deceased 
												and witnessed by two attesting 
												witnesses is the deceased&#8217;s 
												&#8220;Last Will and Testament&#8221; and 
												that therefore the Defendants 
												are the Executors thereof. An 
												Order that the said Paper 
												Writing be admitted to Probate.

												&nbsp;<b>Wills -</b> <b>Letters of 
												Administration &#8211; Recovery of 
												possession &#8211; Property -&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>
												The simple facts of the case are 
												that House No. O.T.77 Kumasi was 
												built by one Madam Afua Mensah, 
												who had two children namely 
												Elizabeth Victoria Mensah and 
												Daniel Owusu. During Madam Afua 
												Mensah's lifetime she sold half 
												of the house to one A.D. 
												Agboloso. After the sale the 
												house was numbered as O.T. 77A 
												and O.T.77B and Afua Mensah 
												retained that part numbered O.T. 
												77A.&nbsp; Madam Afua Mensah died in 
												1950 leaving a will which was 
												tendered in evidence and marked 
												Exhibit &quot;B&quot;. In the will she 
												bequeathed to her son Daniel 
												Owusu and he daughter, Elizabeth 
												Victoria Mensah her portion of 
												the said house. In par 2 of Exh. 
												'B' the Will she said as 
												follows:­The defendants in the 
												case are the children of Daniel 
												Owusu namely Dina Owusu and 
												Daniel Owusu. After the death of 
												Daniel Owusu's mother i.e Afua 
												Mensah he lived in the house 
												with his wife and children. When 
												Daniel Owusu also died in 1959 
												intestate, he was succeeded by 
												his uterine sister Elizabeth 
												Victoria Mausah PW1. The latter 
												obtained Letters of 
												Administration in respect of the 
												estate of her deceased brother 
												and also a lease in respect of 
												the house. She also took steps 
												to have the ownership of the 
												house changed into her name at 
												the Kumasi City Council.&nbsp; When 
												Daniel Owusu died his children 
												i.e. the defendants were too 
												young and so left to live with 
												relatives, but after 16 years 
												they returned to live in their 
												father's house and occupied two 
												rooms which their father had 
												occupied in his lifetime rent 
												free.In 1984 the plaintiff Madam 
												Akosua Agyentoa bought the whole 
												house from Elizabeth Victoria 
												Mensah PW1, who had perfected 
												her title document on the House. 
												After the sale Madam Akosua 
												Agyentoa the Plaintiff took 
												action against the Owusu's 
												children for recovery of 
												possession of the said rooms. 
												Judgment was given in her favour 
												at the District Court and the 
												defendants were ordered to 
												vacate the rooms forthwith.&nbsp; An 
												Appeal to the High Court by the 
												Defendants against the judgment 
												of the lower Court was 
												confirmed. Dissatisfied the 
												Defendants again appealed to the 
												Court of Appeal which court 
												party allowed the Appeal, in a 
												unanimous decision of the Appeal 
												Court. Then the appellant herein 
												also appealed to the Supreme 
												Court. - <b>

												dated 26th January, 1982. In the 
												Will he devised houses and farms 
												to his wife, children and other

												of will devised six rooms in 
												House No. 54 Block 12 to the

												On 2 December 1986, one Moses

												Dr. John Ackah Blay-Miezah died 
												at Abelemkpe in Accra on 30th 
												June 1992 leaving behind a wife 
												and fourteen children, including 
												minors.&nbsp; After his burial, it 
												came to the knowledge of this 
												family that he had left behind a 
												Will deposited in some banks in 
												Switzerland. The family 
												therefore decided that his 
												widow, Mrs. Joyce Blay-Miezah 
												and the head of the family, Nana 
												Asemda should apply for Letters 
												of Administration (L/A) to 
												enable them retrieve this Will 
												from Switzerland.&nbsp; An 
												application for L/A was 
												accordingly filed at the Accra 
												High Court and granted to Mrs. 
												Joyce Blay-Miezah and Nana 
												Asemda on 22nd January 1993. 
												Subsequently, Mr. 
												Adumuah-Bossman applied on 
												behalf of Dr. John Robert Kells 
												and the same Nana Asemda, for 
												probate in respect of a Will 
												allegedly made by Dr. 
												Blay-Miezah on 29th January 1989 
												(the 1989 Will). Once the L/A in 
												respect of the same estate was 
												subsisting, the application for 
												probate was naturally refused. 
												In due course, a copy of the 
												Will deposited in Switzerland, 
												had been obtained and deposited 
												at the Accra High Court.&nbsp; It is 
												dated 8th May 1988 and would 
												hereinafter be referred to as 
												the 1988 Will.&nbsp; Dr. Ako Adjei 
												and Francis K. Mensah sought an 
												application for probate of this 
												Will, but it was caveated.In the 
												interim, a second application 
												for probate of the 1989 Will was 
												made by Dr. John Kells and 
												Joseph Whaja.&nbsp; Francis K. Mensah, 
												Nana Asemda, Roxana Kim 
												Blay-Miezah and Francis Kolorah 
												Blay-Miezah lodged caveats to 
												this application. The last two 
												being the eldest female and male 
												children of the late Dr. 
												Blay-Miezah.&nbsp; All the four 
												caveators contended that the 
												1989 Will was a forgery. 
												Consequently the applicants for 
												probate of the 1989 Will, Dr. 
												John Kells and Joseph Whajah 
												issued the Writ in this appeal, 
												against Dr. Ako Adjei and

												The late Amos Thomas Yalley of 
												the Ebiradze Family of Amanful 
												had in his Will disposed of 
												Houses Nos. 27/2 Ahanta Road and 
												58/2 Summer Road, all at 
												Takoradi to his son Amos Thomas 
												Yalley, Jnr., the defendant in 
												the action. The plaintiffs, the 
												head and member respectively of 
												the same family claimed that the 
												dispositions to the defendant 
												were unlawful as those 
												properties belonged to the 
												family. A dispute having thus 
												arisen over the issue, the 
												family sought a declaration from 
												the High Court that the 
												properties were family 
												properties: They prayed further 
												for an order &#8216;detaching&#8217; the 
												properties from the estate of 
												the deceased. It should be noted 
												that in an earlier abortive 
												appeal at the Court of Appeal, 
												the defendant had conceded that 
												House No. 58/2 Summer Road, 
												Takoradi was a family property. 
												Consequently, the Court in 
												ordering a re-trial, had 
												confined the hearing only to 
												House No. 27/2 Ahanta Road, 
												Takoradi. In the ensuing trial, 
												the High Court gave judgment for 
												the plaintiff declaring House 
												No. 27/2 Ahanta Road, Takoradi 
												as family property. It said the 
												late Amos Thomas Yalley had no 
												testamentary capacity to dispose 
												of it to his son, the defendant. 
												The defendant appealed against 
												this decision to the Court of 
												Appeal which dismissed the 
												appeal and affirmed the judgment 
												of the Court below. Still 
												dissatisfied, the defendant 
												appealed to this Court. On 
												23/2/2000 we unanimously 
												dismissed the appeal. The main 
												issue which arose for 
												determination in the case was 
												whether or not the house was a 
												family property and if so 
												whether the late Amos Thomas 
												Yalley could dispose of it to 
												his son in his Will as if it 
												were his personal property.- <b>

												Vocational Institute 
												(hereinafter referred to as the 
												Institute) was owned by Mrs. 
												Rosamund Mancell who died 
												testate on 14 August 1987. She 
												bequeathed the Institute to her 
												five children. After the 
												necessary probate had been 
												taken, vesting assent was given 
												to the children. One of the 
												children was Elizabeth Mansa 
												Mancell. She died in 1993, 
												leaving behind three children by 
												name Josephine Akita, Francisca 
												Hammond and Ronald Renee. The 
												three children took over the 
												interest of Elizabeth Mansa 
												Mancell in the estate. In this 
												application, Josephine Akita 
												describes herself as the 
												applicant, the administratrix of 
												the estate of the deceased 
												Elizabeth Mansa Mancell and 
												representative of herself and 
												the two children (as appearing 
												in the suit she brought earlier 
												in the High Court). In December 
												2008, the applicant took action 
												in the Human Rights Division of 
												the High Court to nullify the 
												sale for the sole reason that it 
												was concluded without the 
												knowledge and consent of the 
												children of the deceased 
												Elizabeth Mansa Mancell - <b>
