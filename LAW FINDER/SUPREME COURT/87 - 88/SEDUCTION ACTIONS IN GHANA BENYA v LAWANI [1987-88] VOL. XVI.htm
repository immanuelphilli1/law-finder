                                              Nearly two decades ago, two 
                                              teachers of mine posed the 
                                              following questions:</span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

                                              “It is intriguing that actions for 
                                              seduction in Ghana are quite 
                                              frequent, whereas, in England, 
                                              they are nowadays comparatively 
                                              rare. Is this because the cultural 
                                              values of our society cause 
                                              Ghanaian parents and persons in 
                                              loco parentis to feel more 
                                              outraged than English parents when 
                                              their daughters are seduced? Or is 
                                              it merely because Ghanaian parents 
                                              are more mercenary or 
                                              vindictive?”1.</span></p>

                                              The learned authors in search of 
                                              answers to these questions 
                                              examined some local cases and came 
                                              to the conclusion that our law on 
                                              seduction was in considerable need 
                                              of concise and clear statement. 
                                              They expressed the hope that their 
                                              article would stimulate discussion 
                                              on the subject towards a 
                                              clarification of the law on 
                                              seduction. Unhappily the necessary 
                                              response they had hoped for did 
                                              not come forth. Perhaps, it is 
                                              partly due to this lack of 
                                              precision and clarity in the law 
                                              that led to the unfortunate 
                                              decision in Benya v. Lawani,2 a 
                                              decision which has provoked this 
                                              article.</span></p>

                                              thus to revive the attempt towards 
                                              the clarification of this aspect 
                                              of the law in Ghana. In doing so 
                                              the customary aspect of the tort 
                                              should be subjected to a close 
                                              scrutiny. This ought to be done so 
                                              as to discover the respects in 
                                              which the conception of the 
                                              customary law in terms analogous 
                                              to the common law has influenced 
                                              the development of the law towards 
                                              adopting its present posture. But 
                                              before doing so, the facts of the 
                                              case under consideration must be 
                                              presented.</span></p>

                                              in respect of what he called 
                                              “customary seduction” and some 
                                              specified special damages. The 
                                              trial judge, without any 
                                              indication as to what constitutes 
                                              customary seduction and without 
                                              disclosing the basis of her 
                                              assessment, awarded a colossal sum 
                                              of ¢300,000 damages excluding 
                                              ¢30,000 costs in addition to the 
                                              special damages totalling some 
                                              ¢53,000 claimed by the plaintiff. 
                                              Before a closer examination of the 
                                              merits and demerits of the 
                                              decision, it might be worthwhile 
                                              to remind ourselves of the rules 
                                              relating to the tort of seduction 
                                              at common law so as to enhance our 
                                              conceptual clarity from the 
                                              outset.</span></p>

                                              of injuries affecting the family

                                              still tinged with the archaic idea 
                                              that those who interfere with a 
                                              man's rights over his wife or 
                                              child are meddling with more or 
                                              less valuable servants of his 
                                              rather than outraging his domestic 
                                              feelings.3 This view simply 
                                              confirms the fact that at common 
                                              law, a husband's right to a cause 
                                              of action for the enticement of 
                                              his wife has, like the action for 
                                              the seduction of a child, its 
                                              historical foundations in 
                                              master-servant relationship and 
                                              loss of service. Thus Lord, 
                                              Goddard in Best v. Samuel Fox &amp; 
                                              Co, Ltd.4 said that all the 
                                              authorities5 showed that the 
                                              action which the law gave to a 
                                              husband for loss of consortium was 
                                              founded on the proprietary right 
                                              which from ancient times, it was 
                                              considered the husband had in his

                                              However, the interest protected by 
                                              the tort of enticement at common 
                                              law today is the loss by the 
                                              husband of the comfort and society 
                                              of the enticed wife. The action is 
                                              therefore not based, as in the 
                                              case of the seduction of a child, 
                                              on proving loss of service.6 
                                              Liability is automatic and is not 
                                              dependent on carnal knowledge of 
                                              the wife by the enticer. Thus 
                                              although the historical roots of 
                                              seduction and enticement actions 
                                              are traceable to master-servant 
                                              relationship and its associated 
                                              loss of service, it is the latter, 
                                              loss of service, as an essential 
                                              ingredient of the tort of 
                                              seduction that distinguishes it 
                                              from enticement actions. This is 
                                              why Lord Campbell in Lynch v. 
                                              Knight thought that loss of 
                                              consortium or conjugal society was 
                                              one that the law might recognise 
                                              to the wife as well as the 
                                              husband, but hastened to add that 
                                              the wife was not the servant of 
                                              her husband and that the action 
                                              for criminal conversation did not 
                                              rest on “the fiction of loss of 
                                              service as does the action for the 
                                              seduction of a daughter.”7</span></p>

                                              Some of our judges also recognise 
                                              this distinguishing feature of the 
                                              actions for enticement and

                                              Dapah v. Madzigbe,8 Francois J, as 
                                              he then was, said:</span></p>

                                              &quot;It does not appear that under the 
                                              common law a right to sue for 
                                              seduction is one of the benefits a 
                                              husband acquires on marriage. The 
                                              reason is obvious. The action 
                                              derives from the concept of master 
                                              and servant. If this relationship 
                                              is not proved as also the 
                                              consequent loss of service (per 
                                              quod servitium amisit) the action 
                                              fails. Our inherited common law, 
                                              of course, is English. The English 
                                              do not conceive of their wives as 
                                              servants.”</span></p>

                                              It would, however, appear that not 
                                              enough attention is always paid to 
                                              the difference between the two

                                              in Ghana when the term “seduction” 
                                              is applied to customary 
                                              situations. This would seem to be 
                                              one main source of confusion in 
                                              the law. While the common law 
                                              draws a distinction between the 
                                              two torts, actions which might be 
                                              classified as enticement at common 
                                              law are labelled together with the 
                                              inducement and persuasion of a 
                                              child to leave the home as 
                                              customary seduction. When for 
                                              instance, Her Ladyship declared in

                                              customary law not only for the 
                                              loss of services but also in 
                                              respect of his injured feelings, 
                                              was she applying the common law or

                                              admixture of both of them or 
                                              simply confusing the common law 
                                              with the customary law? It is 
                                              necessary to find answers to these 
                                              questions in order to clarify the

                                              It would seem that where the 
                                              protection of the husband and wife 
                                              relationship is in question, the 
                                              customary law treats the subject

                                              It must be remembered that Sarbah 
                                              was a lawyer. His choice of words 
                                              in describing the remedy for the 
                                              “seduction” of a married woman as 
                                              distinct from that for the 
                                              “seduction” of an unmarried woman 
                                              must therefore be regarded as 
                                              significant. At the beginning of 
                                              the same passage quoted earlier, 
                                              Sarbah states that “if a man 
                                              seduce [sic] an unmarried woman, 
                                              he is liable to pay her family 
                                              damages for the wrong done her and 
                                              the disgrace brought on her 
                                              family.” He describes the remedy 
                                              for the “seduction” of a married 
                                              woman not simply as damages but as 
                                              a “fine or penalty.” This would 
                                              suggest that the seduction of a 
                                              married woman was regarded by the 
                                              traditional society, as reflected 
                                              in the law, as being a more 
                                              reprehensible conduct than the 
                                              mere seduction of an unmarried 
                                              woman. For this reason, it ought 
                                              to be punished by a fine—a 
                                              penalty, as indicating public 
                                              disapproval of that kind of 
                                              conduct. The law would seem to 
                                              lean, therefore, more towards the 
                                              province of the criminal law than 
                                              private law, or at least, the 
                                              combination of both.</span></p>

                                              Danquah who is also a jurist like 
                                              Sarbah, employs the term “fines” 
                                              and not damages, as the prescribed 
                                              remedy for the “seduction” of a

                                              law. There is also abundant 
                                              evidence in the very instructive,

                                              judgment of Taylor J, as he then 
                                              was, in Billa v Salifu13 that in 
                                              most traditional communal 
                                              subsistent societies, the 
                                              seduction of a married woman or 
                                              adultery had been regarded as 
                                              serious enough a conduct to 
                                              attract the death penalty. This 
                                              was particularly so when the wife 
                                              of a traditional authority was 
                                              involved. In the relevant portion 
                                              of the judgment of Taylor J, as 
                                              summarised in the headnote, it is 
                                              stated that in Dagomba customary 
                                              law “an adulterer was punished by 
                                              the chief and required to pay pan 
                                              kobiga [vagina money] which was 
                                              adultery fee.” The learned judge 
                                              concluded that since the money 
                                              went to the chief and not to the 
                                              husband, it was a quasi-criminal 
                                              remedy and not a claim sounding in 
                                              damages.</span></p>

                                              Neither Danquah nor Sarbah did say

                                              elders adjudicating upon such

                                              by their choice of words in the 
                                              exposition of the customary law, 
                                              would seem to suggest that as in 
                                              Dagomba customary law, the remedy 
                                              for the tort in Akan customary law 
                                              could be described as 
                                              quasi-criminal in content. 
                                              Whatever may be the nature of the 
                                              action under the customary law, it 
                                              is clear that liability is 
                                              automatic provided it has been 
                                              proved that a valid marriage 
                                              exists and that the wife left the

                                              and persuasion of her seducer.

                                              of liability, customary seduciton 
                                              of a wife is not so identical with 
                                              common law of enticement as to 
                                              justify labelling it as seduction. 
                                              This is bound to cause confusion 
                                              in the law. The likelihood of 
                                              confusion is aggravated by 
                                              labelling together the inducement 
                                              and persuasion of a child, an 
                                              unmarried and a married woman in 
                                              the traditional society as 
                                              customary seduction. We suspect 
                                              that the learned judge had fallen 
                                              a victim to this confusion in the 
                                              law in Benya v. Lawani. That case 
                                              involved the seduction of a school 
                                              girl by a medical practitioner. 
                                              She held that the defendant was 
                                              bound to pay damages at customary 
                                              law, “not only for the loss of 
                                              services but also in respect of 
                                              injured feelings of the 
                                              plaintiff.”14 In assessing 
                                              damages, she declared that the 
                                              defendant was “entitled 
                                              automatically to pay damages at 
                                              customary law. . .” As we have 
                                              seen earlier, the common law 
                                              action for seduction is based on 
                                              proof of loss of services while 
                                              liability for enticement is 
                                              automatic. As will be shown 
                                              presently, all the authorities 
                                              show that master-servant 
                                              relationship and consequent loss 
                                              of service is not an element of 
                                              the traditional remedy for 
                                              inducing or persuading a child to 
                                              leave the home. Yet in the 
                                              confused state of the law, the 
                                              learned judge was apparently 
                                              applying common law remedies to a 
                                              customary situation. What then are 
                                              the essential ingredients of 
                                              customary “seduction” of an 
                                              unmarried woman? This must be the 
                                              next subject of inquiry.</span></p>

                                              the decided cases show that at 
                                              customary law, an action for 
                                              seduction is available to a man 
                                              whose wife or child has been

                                              Several questions remain however, 
                                              to be answered in order to 
                                              ascertain what precisely one 
                                              should be looking for as the basic

                                              of a single woman. What, for 
                                              instance, constitutes the “wrong” 
                                              done to the victim for which her 
                                              family, and not herself, must be 
                                              compensated? At common law the 
                                              basis of the parent's claim is the 
                                              loss of service or services which 
                                              can be ascertained and specified. 
                                              Under the indigenous law, does the 
                                              wrong consist in the act of 
                                              persuading and inducing the woman 
                                              to leave the home or should this 
                                              be coupled with carnal knowledge 
                                              of her? If so, there would seem to 
                                              be no sound reason why sexual 
                                              intercourse between two consenting 
                                              adults, the female partner of 
                                              which is unmarried should 
                                              constitute a “wrong” done to her 
                                              for which the law must give a 
                                              remedy, not to the woman said to 
                                              be “wronged” herself, but to her

                                              Perhaps the customary law would 
                                              adopt a more redeeming posture if 
                                              the age of the female partner were 
                                              to be taken into account in 
                                              determining liability. But this 
                                              has never been clearly articulated 
                                              in the law. Sarbah wrote simply 
                                              about the seduction of an 
                                              unmarried woman and the courts 
                                              have echoed this without any 
                                              qualification. It is trite law 
                                              that the customary law does the 
                                              reasonable in the circumstances of 
                                              each case. It would therefore seem 
                                              not only unreasonable and 
                                              inconsistent with the tenets of 
                                              the customary law itself but 
                                              unconscionable to employ its 
                                              principles to permit an unmarried 
                                              woman who has freely consented to 
                                              sexual intercourse in which she 
                                              freely participated only to turn 
                                              round thereafter and inform her 
                                              family to damnify her sexual 
                                              partner in damages for the “wrong” 
                                              done her.</span></p>

                                              to sue. The daughter herself 
                                              should be entitled to sue only 
                                              when there has been a pregnancy

                                              It does not appear that in the

                                              Hence the learned judge would seem

                                              common error of confusing

                                              uncritically applied the admixture

                                              principles to the case at hand. 
                                              When Her Ladyship declared that 
                                              there was no doubt that the 
                                              plaintiff was entitled to recover 
                                              damages at customary law not only 
                                              for the loss of services but also 
                                              in respect of his injured 
                                              feelings, she purported to be 
                                              relying on the authority of two 
                                              cases. The first one, Asante v. 
                                              Sarpong,18 concerned the seduction 
                                              of a seventeen-year old school 
                                              girl, Lydia, who became pregnant 
                                              and had a baby. She said in her 
                                              evidence that she continued to 
                                              perform the same services as she 
                                              did before, during the period of 
                                              her pregnancy. On the strength of 
                                              this evidence counsel for the 
                                              defendant contended that as the 
                                              plaintiff did not lose Lydia's 
                                              services during the period in 
                                              question, the action for seduction 
                                              did not lie. Apaloo J, as he then 
                                              was, held that it was not 
                                              reasonable to believe that Lydia 
                                              would be in a fit physical state 
                                              to render her father the services 
                                              she rendered even during her 
                                              confinement. “Since the notion of 
                                              service is in itself, a fiction,” 
                                              said His Lordship, “the loss of 
                                              service for even one day would 
                                              suffice to ground an action in 
                                              seduction. I think the plaintiff 
                                              lost Lydia's services during her 
                                              confinement and is entitled to 
                                              damages against the defendant.”19</span></p>

                                              the customary law in any way. His 
                                              decision was premised on proof of 
                                              loss of service, which as we have 
                                              seen, is not an element 
                                              constituting the customary law 
                                              tort of seduction of a girl or an

                                              of the plaintiff”, Her Ladyship 
                                              failed to make it clear whether or 
                                              not this ought to be equated with 
                                              the “dishonour and disgrace” 
                                              brought on the parents of the 
                                              seduced girl. It may well be that 
                                              their injured feelings are 
                                              predicated upon the disgrace and 
                                              dishonour brought on the family. 
                                              No attempt at any explanation was, 
                                              however, made in Her Ladyship's 
                                              judgment. It should however be 
                                              remarked that claims for injured 
                                              feelings in seduction actions 
                                              ought not to be encouraged as it 
                                              would be difficult to find an 
                                              objective basis for determining 
                                              liability in such cases. This 
                                              should be particularly so as lack 
                                              of conceptual clarity concerning 
                                              the basic ingredients of the 
                                              customary law appears to be a 
                                              contributory factor in the 
                                              difficulties attending the 
                                              determination of liability and 
                                              assessment of damages. No doubt, 
                                              the learned judge found herself in 
                                              such difficulties in Benya v 
                                              Lawani.</span></p>

                                              Damage at common law is money 
                                              adjudged to be paid by one person 
                                              to another as compensation for a 
                                              loss sustained by the latter in 
                                              consequence of an injury committed 
                                              by the former.21 Damages fall 
                                              under two general heads. The 
                                              first, described as liquidated 
                                              damages, is where the amount 
                                              recoverable by the plaintiff is 
                                              ascertainable by calculation or is 
                                              fixed by any scale or some 
                                              positive data. The second, 
                                              unliquidated damages, arise in 
                                              most tort cases, particularly 
                                              those categorised as being 
                                              actionable per se, such as for 
                                              instance, libel, false 
                                              imprisonment, or as we have seen, 
                                              in customary seduction. In such 
                                              cases the quantum of damages would 
                                              be such as the law would presume 
                                              to flow from the injury done to 
                                              the plaintiff.</span></p>

                                              The basis for the distinction 
                                              between liquidated and 
                                              unliquidated damages is that the 
                                              measure of damages in the case of 
                                              the former is usually clear and 
                                              certain while the latter is not so 
                                              clear and precise. It must be 
                                              noted, however, that whether or 
                                              not one is concerned with the 
                                              latter or the former, the 
                                              assessment of damages cannot be 
                                              made arbitrarily. We thus find, 
                                              for example, the development in 
                                              our courts, of a practice in 
                                              personal injury cases, some 
                                              objective criteria for determining 
                                              liability and the assessment of 
                                              damages in a consistent and 
                                              coherent manner. In claims for 
                                              pain and suffering resulting from 
                                              injuries to the person, for 
                                              example, references are made to 
                                              the gravity of the injury and the 
                                              length of time it has been endured 
                                              or continues to be endured in 
                                              order to determine the measure of 
                                              damages. Here, the judge's term of 
                                              reference is the physical 
                                              injuries, and sometimes medical 
                                              reports, all of which he takes 
                                              into account in determining the 
                                              quantum of damages. He does 
                                              exercise discretion, but his 
                                              calculation is not determined 
                                              simply by what the victim tells 
                                              him to be the extent of his pains 
                                              or sufferings.22 Similarly, on 
                                              claims in respect of loss of 
                                              amenities and of expectation of 
                                              life, the judges do refer to the 
                                              age and social life of the injured 
                                              party. If he was, before his 
                                              injury actively engaged in 
                                              sporting activities and games, was 
                                              a member of social clubs, used to 
                                              love dancing, etc, and is now 
                                              unable to do so in consequence of 
                                              his injuries, these ascertainable 
                                              activities become the main factors 
                                              in determining the measure of 
                                              damages.23 It is self-evident then 
                                              that in spite of the fact that 
                                              such claims are for “pain and 
                                              sufferings” in the abstract and 
                                              intangible in themselves, ocular 
                                              observation of physical objects 
                                              serve as a guide to the measure of 
                                              damages. The task of the judge is 
                                              made easier by the fact that such 
                                              damages are tied up to a 
                                              three-tiered concept of duty, 
                                              breach and damage as constituting 
                                              negligence upon which liability is 
                                              premised. Once this has been 
                                              established, the judge turns to 
                                              the developed practice as a guide 
                                              in assessing damages.</span></p>

                                              When we turn to customary 
                                              seduction, however, it would 
                                              appear that lack of precision 
                                              concerning the basic ingredients 
                                              of customary seduction has 
                                              adversely affected the development 
                                              of any consistent basis for 
                                              determining the measure of 
                                              damages. For example, in Benya v 
                                              Lawani itself, the learned judge 
                                              found no difficulty in granting 
                                              damages for the losses incurred by 
                                              the plaintiff in respect of 
                                              clothing and feeding bottles for 
                                              the baby, extra care for the 
                                              pregnant daughter and the cloth 
                                              purchased for her. Being in the 
                                              nature of liquidated damages, they 
                                              were specially pleaded and 
                                              specifically proved. When it came 
                                              to assessing damages for the 
                                              customary seduction, “not only for 
                                              the loss of services but also in 
                                              respect of the injured feelings of 
                                              the plaintiff” problems arose.</span></p>

                                              As the learned judge considered 
                                              loss of services as a basis of 
                                              liability in customary seduction, 
                                              being in the nature of liquidated 
                                              damages, it should have been 
                                              specifically pleaded and strictly 
                                              proved. There was no evidence in 
                                              the judgment that this was done. 
                                              Yet Her Ladyship failed to 
                                              indicate in her judgment, what 
                                              proportion of the ¢300,000 
                                              represented loss of services. 
                                              Perhaps, the learned judge 
                                              regarded loss of services as a 
                                              fiction, as conceived by Apaloo J, 
                                              as he then was, in Asante v. 
                                              Sarpong, a case she relied upon 
                                              for her decision. Even so it would 
                                              have been helpful if it was made 
                                              known, the proportion of the award 
                                              representing that head of damage. 
                                              Similarly, in regarding injured 
                                              feelings as another head under 
                                              which liability would ensue, was 
                                              she equating injured feelings with 
                                              the disgrace and dishonour brought 
                                              on the family? This is an 
                                              important issue because Asante v. 
                                              Sarpong24 from which the learned 
                                              judge implied that injured 
                                              feelings must be compensated for 
                                              was presumably decided under the 
                                              common law and not under customary 
                                              law. Even should that question be 
                                              answered affirmatively, it would 
                                              be enough to point out that 
                                              disgrace and dishonour, like 
                                              injured feelings, are not subject 
                                              to actuarial calculation. Yet some 
                                              objective criteria must be 
                                              employed as determining the 
                                              measure of damages, depending on 
                                              the circumstances of each 
                                              particular case. Regrettably this 
                                              issue was insufficiently addressed 
                                              in the Benya case. It is conceded 
                                              that damages are presumed as was 
                                              pointed out by the Court of Appeal 
                                              in Yanney v Nyamekye,25 but then, 
                                              the criteria laid down there and 
                                              other authorities such as Sarbah 
                                              and Addison v. Acheampong for 
                                              instance, are (a) the disgrace and 
                                              dishonour brought on the family, 
                                              and (b) the wrong done to the 
                                              seduced girl. This is basic. As 
                                              the decision in Benya v. Lawani 
                                              stands at present, there is no 
                                              guide as to how the ¢300,000 was 
                                              arrived at. The proportions 
                                              representing loss of services, 
                                              which as we have argued was 
                                              wrongly included, injured 
                                              feelings, if that must be equated 
                                              with the disgrace and dishonour 
                                              brought on the family, and the 
                                              wrong done to the girl remain 
                                              unspecified.</span></p>

                                              learned judge sought to

                                              punishment to the defendant with a

                                              In Dapah v. Madzigbe,26 Francois 
                                              J, as he then was, held that the 
                                              measure of damages for customary 
                                              seduction should not be equated 
                                              with the depth of the defendant's 
                                              pocket. Implied in this holding is 
                                              the rationale that a man must be 
                                              compensated for what would 
                                              reasonably be assessed to have 
                                              actually been lost by him and the 
                                              assessment should not depend on 
                                              what the defendant is or is not 
                                              capable of paying. To hold 
                                              otherwise would amount to either 
                                              punishing the defendant or denying 
                                              the plaintiff what is fully due to 
                                              him. That is why the learned judge 
                                              reduced the amount of damages 
                                              awarded by the magistrate court at 
                                              the court below from ¢290 to ¢100. 
                                              In this respect we may take a cue 
                                              from the statement of Apaloo J, as 
                                              he then was, in Asante v. Sarpong. 
                                              In quantifying general damages, he 
                                              said:</span></p>

                                              injured feeling and the 
                                              defendant's provocative conduct in

                                              damages in this case should be

                                              damages should be compensatory and 
                                              not penal; and this must

                                              that into account in assessing 
                                              general damages. But such 
                                              provocative conduct per se may be 
                                              a sufficient but not a necessary 
                                              condition for enhanced or 
                                              aggravated damage.28 Although the 
                                              case was decided under the common 
                                              law, the views expressed by the 
                                              learned judge on the assessment of 
                                              damages would hold good for the 
                                              customary law as well.</span></p>

                                              It is obvious that the learned 
                                              judge was importing into his 
                                              criteria for determining the

                                              safer for the law if the judge 
                                              draws a distinction between what 
                                              he considers to be moral or 
                                              immoral and the loss sustained by 
                                              the plaintiff. Whether the conduct 
                                              from which the injury giving rise 
                                              to liability may be considered as 
                                              moral or immoral should be

                                              actions which may be regarded as

                                              or Takyi v. Amoyaw, for instance, 
                                              nothing would prevent the parents 
                                              of the seduced girls from 
                                              informing the police or initiating

                                              Similarly, the Medical and Dental 
                                              Board and the Ministry of 
                                              Education could be informed 
                                              respectively to take disciplinary

                                              or punitive damages, he is often

                                              point out, general damages are

                                              defendant only where his conduct 
                                              is considered to be wanton, “as

                                              officials of the Social Welfare. 
                                              These were rebuffed by the

                                              damages awarded was rather 
                                              punitive and excessive. The case 
                                              must therefore not be relied upon 
                                              as a guide in the future. It is 
                                              also suggested that exemplary or 
                                              punitive damages should be awarded 
                                              sparingly, particularly where the 
                                              conduct from which the liability 
                                              ensues, both criminal and civil 
                                              remedies could be available. For 
                                              the judge to award exemplary 
                                              damages in such cases, he would 
                                              have usurped part of the functions 
                                              of what should otherwise be left 
                                              for the criminal law and 
                                              extra-legal disciplinary 
                                              institutions and the community 
                                              itself.</span></p>

                                              An examination of some Court of 
                                              Appeal decisions would disclose 
                                              the development of consistent 
                                              rules for guiding the courts in 
                                              the assessment of damages in court 
                                              proceedings. These rules are so 
                                              consistent and so frequently 
                                              applied to interfere with costs 
                                              awarded in the courts at the lower 
                                              hierarchy that they could now be 
                                              regarded as having developed into 
                                              practice directions to the lower 
                                              courts. Yet it does appear that 
                                              sufficient judicial notice has yet 
                                              to be taken of these rules by the 
                                              lower courts. The Benya case 
                                              provides a classic example of such 
                                              oversight. It has therefore become 
                                              necessary to raise the issue in 
                                              order to bring the rules to the 
                                              attention of both the bench and 
                                              the bar.</span></p>

                                              What can be deduced from the 
                                              decisions of the Court of Appeal 
                                              over the last ten years or so is 
                                              that the award of costs in the 
                                              cause involves the exercise of 
                                              discretion by the judge. However, 
                                              this discretion must be exercised 
                                              judicially. This implies having or 
                                              exercising sound, wise and 
                                              sensible judgment especially in 
                                              relation to practical matters 
                                              which often do arise in the 
                                              proceedings. However, some of the 
                                              judges sometimes inadvertently 
                                              overlook the rules laid down by 
                                              the Court of Appeal and award 
                                              costs out of proportion to the 
                                              actual costs incurred in the 
                                              cause. This is due, perhaps to the 
                                              fact that some of the judges get 
                                              swayed by the quantum of damages 
                                              awarded by them or what they might 
                                              regard as the reprehensible 
                                              conduct of the losing party. This 
                                              often leads to arbitrary exercise 
                                              of discretion with regard to the 
                                              award of costs as was exhibited by 
                                              the learned judge in Benya v 
                                              Lawani.</span></p>

                                              As would be recalled, costs of 
                                              ¢30,000 were awarded against the 
                                              defendant. Yet from the record of 
                                              proceedings, we found that neither 
                                              party was represented by counsel. 
                                              The actual hearing lasted for only 
                                              one day. Only the plaintiff gave 
                                              evidence on the basis of which 
                                              judgment was given. These account 
                                              for the short written judgment of 
                                              about one and half pages. As will 
                                              be shown presently, the costs 
                                              awarded were in clear disregard of 
                                              the guidelines and principles laid 
                                              down by the Court of Appeal to 
                                              circumscribe the exercise of such

                                              in the appeal was that the 500

                                              counsel, the length of time taken 
                                              by the actual hearing itself, 
                                              which might be determined by the 
                                              number of adjournments, the number 
                                              of witnesses, interlocutory 
                                              applications, etc. The principles 
                                              of these cases were re-affirmed 
                                              five years later in Real Estate 
                                              Developers Ltd v. Fosua.34 Here 
                                              the Court of Appeal was 
                                              considering the circumstances 
                                              under which appellate courts would 
                                              interfere with costs awarded by 
                                              trial courts. It reinforced the 
                                              view that even though the award of 
                                              costs had always been 
                                              discretionary, the exercise of 
                                              that judicial discretion in the 
                                              instant case was not based on any 
                                              known judicial principle and that 
                                              the trial judge might have taken 
                                              into deliberation extraneous 
                                              matters. The Court of Appeal came 
                                              to that conclusion because, the 
                                              hearing of the two consolidated 
                                              suits involving the same counsel 
                                              for both parties lasted for four 
                                              days only and some costs had 
                                              already been awarded in the trial 
                                              for adjournments at the instance 
                                              of the defence. On those facts the 
                                              Court of Appeal concluded that 
                                              there was no basis for awarding 
                                              costs of ¢10,000 and ¢150,000 in 
                                              favour of the first and second 
                                              plaintiffs respectively. The court 
                                              proceeded to reduce the costs to 
                                              ¢2,500 in respect of each suit.</span></p>

                                              It is submitted that on the 
                                              strength of the cases reviewed, 
                                              there was no legal basis for the 
                                              assessment of the ¢30,000 costs 
                                              awarded by the learned judge in 
                                              Benya v. Lawani, where as we have 
                                              seen, the actual hearing lasted 
                                              for only one day and neither party 
                                              was represented by counsel whose 
                                              works and fees would have to be 
                                              taken into account in assessing 
                                              costs in the cause. The Court of 
                                              Appeal stressed such factors in 
                                              Acquah v Oman Ghana Trust Holding 
                                              Ltd.35 One of the issues for 
                                              determination in that case was 
                                              whether or not the award of 
                                              ¢36,000 costs in a simple landlord 
                                              and tenant case in which the 
                                              hearing took four days was 
                                              reasonable. The Court of Appeal 
                                              emphasising that like all judicial 
                                              discretions, it ought to be 
                                              exercised judicially, noted that 
                                              the case did not involve any 
                                              complex issues of law or any time 
                                              consuming research. The Court of 
                                              Appeal thought that the costs 
                                              awarded by the trial judge ought 
                                              to reflect the judge's assessment 
                                              of the industry put in the case as 
                                              well as the reasonable expense to 
                                              which the beneficiary of the award 
                                              might have been put. On the facts 
                                              of the case, the court found the 
                                              sum of ¢36,000 costs so 
                                              unprecedented and so manifestly 
                                              excessive that they could only be 
                                              a most arbitrary exercise of 
                                              judicial discretion and thus set 
                                              it aside.</span></p>

                                              All the authorities then point to 
                                              the fact that it would not be 
                                              enough for a judge to say simply 
                                              at the end of his judgment, as did 
                                              the learned judge in Benya v 
                                              Lawani, that “costs assessed at 
                                              ¢30,000” without more. To be a 
                                              judicial exercise of that 
                                              discretion, the judge must 
                                              disclose the basis of his 
                                              assessment—that is the factors 
                                              which he took into account in 
                                              exercising his discretion in the 
                                              manner he did. The court made an 
                                              explicit statement on this in 
                                              Kusi-Apea v. National House of 
                                              Chiefs, Kumasi.36 In that case, 
                                              the second respondent had to 
                                              travel from Brong-Ahafo Region on 
                                              several occasions to successfully 
                                              resist the claim against him in 
                                              Kumasi in the Ashanti Region. 
                                              However, the judge refused to 
                                              award costs in his favour. The 
                                              Court of Appeal in its judgment 
                                              said that unless there were very 
                                              sound reasons for it, a successful 
                                              party in a suit was entitled to 
                                              his costs and it was not a proper 
                                              exercise of discretion to refuse 
                                              the second respondent his 
                                              legitimate costs without the High 
                                              Court assigning good reasons for 
                                              the refusal. In the light of the 
                                              authorities, it is submitted 
                                              firstly, that the assessment by 
                                              which the ¢30,000 costs were 
                                              awarded in the Benya case was 
                                              anything but judicial. Secondly, 
                                              the lower courts should, in 
                                              awarding costs, advert to the 
                                              principles of assessment of costs 
                                              as laid down by the Court of

                                              Although we have found no 
                                              definition of the “wrong” in any 
                                              of the cases, it would appear that 
                                              it consists in the effects on the 
                                              woman of the persuasion and 
                                              inducement on the strength of 
                                              which she has left the home. In 
                                              many cases, leaving the home is 
                                              accompanied with carnal knowledge 
                                              of the woman by her seducer. Such 
                                              a relationship might go on 
                                              clandestinely and may not become 
                                              publicly known until pregnancy 
                                              occurs.</span></p>

                                              It is doubtful whether on grounds 
                                              of social policy it would be 
                                              desirable for the law to prevent 
                                              pre-marital courtship and wooing 
                                              of the fair sex in a modern 
                                              society. In modern society, 
                                              courtship and wooing often precede 
                                              actual marriage. Yet it seems the 
                                              policy of the customary law is to 
                                              discourage such pre-marital 
                                              relationships. According to Sarbah, 
                                              quoting Artus’ reference to the 
                                              customary law in 1625:</span></p>

                                              The statement quoted above clearly 
                                              shows the extent to which

                                              frowned upon pre-marital sexual

                                              reflected in the customary law. 
                                              The position would seem not to

                                              which stamps the relationship as 
                                              immoral, to be remedied as quickly

                                              The customary law of seduction was 
                                              thus in the past, based on 
                                              traditional society's conceptions 
                                              of what is moral or immoral about 
                                              sexual life. The views held then 
                                              were closely associated with the 
                                              way in which it was thought 
                                              society should be organised. For 
                                              instance, it is trite learning 
                                              that the family is regarded as the 
                                              unit and foundation of society. 
                                              Its stability, unity and cohesion 
                                              is thus essential for an orderly 
                                              organisation of society. Added to 
                                              this fact is the notion that 
                                              marriage brings about the union of 
                                              families. In traditional society 
                                              therefore, parents and guardians 
                                              are concerned about the sort of 
                                              families their sons and daughters 
                                              get married into. For this reason, 
                                              particularly in the past, it was 
                                              the responsibility of parents to 
                                              investigate the family background 
                                              of those proposing to marry their 
                                              daughters. For instance, 
                                              preliminary investigations as to 
                                              the existence of witchcraft, 
                                              diseases such as leprosy and 
                                              mental disorders, are made about 
                                              the respective families of the 
                                              bride and bridegroom.</span></p>

                                              In traditional societies of the 
                                              past therefore, it would be out 
                                              step with social mores and norms 
                                              for a youngman to seduce an

                                              married one. Where the woman, 
                                              became pregnant and therefore 
                                              became publicly known, this might 
                                              not only be regarded as outrageous 
                                              but disrespect for constituted 
                                              traditional authority and sacred 
                                              social norms that sustained the 
                                              health, unity and cohesion of the 
                                              family and society at large. The 
                                              question however is whether or not 
                                              such considerations still hold 
                                              good for Ghanaian society of this

                                              man is disgraced, what it means is 
                                              that he has be lowered in the 
                                              estimation in which he is held in 
                                              the eyes of members of the

                                              The question then is whether or

                                              the answer would depend on the 
                                              extent to which Western ideas of 
                                              civilisation and permissive

                                              norms of the seventeenth, eighteen 
                                              and nineteenth centuries which the 
                                              present posture of the law seems 
                                              to reflect can certainly not

                                              out that seduction actions in 
                                              England are nowadays, 
                                              comparatively rare, the reason is 
                                              that English ideas of sexual life 
                                              have completely changed from what 
                                              they were in the last four 
                                              centuries when seduction actions 
                                              were common there. It would be a 
                                              travesty of the true position to 
                                              suggest that Ghanaians’ ideas 
                                              about social and sexual life have 
                                              not undergone some metamorphosis 
                                              under the impact of Western ideas 
                                              of civilisation and socio-economic 
                                              change, quite different from what

                                              in thinking that by awarding

                                              developments, the courts should

                                              a seduction action, the plaintiff 
                                              must prove the following:</span></p>

                                              may ask, was the loss to the 
                                              plaintiff and his daughter in that 
                                              case where the daughter had 
                                              continued her formal education

                                              law must not lend support to the 
                                              institution of seduction actions

                                              vindictive considerations. In 
                                              cases of seduction which results 
                                              in pregnancy and the birth of a 
                                              child, the welfare of the child 
                                              must become the primary 
                                              consideration for the judge. 
                                              Vindictive and mercenary attitudes 
                                              on the part of the seduced girl's 
                                              parents could so seriously affect 
                                              relations between the parties that 
                                              the welfare of the child might be 
                                              sacrificed in the long run. The 
                                              courts must not encourage this. It 
                                              is hoped that this discussion will 
                                              revive comments on this aspect of 
                                              the law towards its progressive
