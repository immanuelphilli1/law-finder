                                              IT has often been said that &quot;the 
                                              law is in the bosom of judges.&quot; 
                                              This often quoted statement means 
                                              that judges are presumed to know 
                                              the law and are capable of 
                                              declaring it at anytime. This, of 
                                              course, is a legal fiction. It is 
                                              however particularly true of the 
                                              law of customary arbitration, 
                                              because all the law that we know 
                                              on the subject of customary 
                                              arbitration is to be found in the 
                                              decisions handed down by judges 
                                              from 1883 to the present day.&nbsp; No 
                                              attempt has been made to codify 
                                              these decisions. There is no 
                                              statute which can be looked at as 
                                              the primary source of the law 
                                              governing customary arbitrations. 
                                              To find the true position of the 
                                              law one has to go to the Law 
                                              Reports.&nbsp; If one is lucky to come 
                                              across a decision, one must 
                                              research further to find out 
                                              whether that decided case has been 
                                              overruled, reversed or doubted in 
                                              a later case or cases.&nbsp; </span>

                                              It must be pointed out at this 
                                              stage that we have had on our

                                              be explained later in this 
                                              discussion there are differences 
                                              between customary arbitration and 
                                              the provisions of these 
                                              enactments. These enactments were 
                                              not intended as a codification of 
                                              the customary principles of

                                              Professor A N Allott in his book, 
                                              Essays in African Law,9 used the 
                                              term &quot;arbitral proceedings&quot; 
                                              instead of &quot;customary

                                              new term should be devised (he 
                                              does not suggest one) which would 
                                              bring out the differences between 
                                              customary arbitration and

                                              not necessary to devise a new term 
                                              for &quot;customary arbitration.&quot;&nbsp; What 
                                              is important is for one to know 
                                              that the word &quot;arbitration&quot; in the

                                              The use of the expression

                                              vocabulary (having been used by 
                                              such textwriters as Sarbah,

                                              When the concept of one language 
                                              is expressed in another language, 
                                              two things may happen.&nbsp; Either (a) 
                                              the concept may not exist at all 
                                              in the other language, or (b) the 
                                              concept may exist in the other 
                                              language but the characteristics 
                                              and incidents may be different in 
                                              both languages.&nbsp; In this 
                                              connection, it would be 
                                              instructive to refer to the 
                                              example of marriage in England and 
                                              in Ghana.&nbsp; The fact that one is 
                                              monogamous and the other 
                                              polygamous has never been seen as 
                                              good reason to look for another 
                                              expression to describe marriage 
                                              under customary law.&nbsp; A marriage 
                                              is no less a marriage because it 
                                              describes the Ghanaian situation 
                                              rather than the English concept.&nbsp; 
                                              So it is that &quot;customary 
                                              arbitration&quot; is no less so because 
                                              it does not import all the 
                                              ingredients of the English concept 
                                              of arbitration.</span></p>

                                              the settlement of a dispute by an

                                              that the arbitrators wanted some 
                                              preliminary idea of the nature of 
                                              the lands in dispute before 
                                              inspecting them, and before 
                                              hearing the case on the merits; 
                                              but after the inspection of the 
                                              land there was no hearing on the 
                                              merits. I have found that the 
                                              alleged decision of the 
                                              arbitrators was never given; but 
                                              if it has been, it would have been 
                                              an arbitrary decision based upon 
                                              no evidence at all.&quot;</span></p>

                                              Where an arbitrator exceeds his 
                                              agreed terms of reference or 
                                              proceeds to share the 
                                              subject-matter in dispute between 
                                              the disputants the so-called 
                                              arbitration is null and void ab 
                                              initio. Thus in the case of 
                                              Omanhene Kobina Foli v Chief Obeng 
                                              Akesse,30 the Privy Council held 
                                              that the learned arbitrator had 
                                              misconceived his duty by laying 
                                              down a new boundary line based on 
                                              consideration of what would be a 
                                              fair division of the disputed area 
                                              between the parties and they 
                                              accordingly set aside the award on 
                                              the ground that the arbitrator had 
                                              acted ultra fines compromisi. This 
                                              decision was followed by the 
                                              Supreme Court in Nyame v Yeboah31 
                                              where it was held that an 
                                              arbitrary boundary which the 
                                              Beponhene attempted to fix for the 
                                              parties if intended to be in 
                                              execution of the award of the 
                                              alleged arbitration was 
                                              misconceived and contrary to 
                                              settled principles of law. 
                                              Similarly, in Mensah v Esah32a the 
                                              so-called arbitrator in a dispute 
                                              of successorship shared the estate 
                                              between the disputants. The Court 
                                              of Appeal held that the mere 
                                              sharing of the estate detracted 
                                              considerably from any 
                                              determination of successorship.&nbsp;

                                              It is, therefore, clear from the 
                                              cases that arbitrators are by 
                                              customary law, required to decide 
                                              and pronounce on the respective 
                                              conflicting claims of the parties 
                                              and not to do what King Solomon 
                                              32b threatened to do by dividing 
                                              the baby, the subject-matter of 
                                              the dispute.&nbsp; Such conduct renders 
                                              an arbitration award null and 
                                              void.&nbsp; One other essential rule of 
                                              customary arbitration is that the 
                                              decision on the merits must be 
                                              arrived at after a fair hearing of 
                                              both parties.&nbsp; In Budu II v 
                                              Caesar,33 for example, Ollennu J, 
                                              as he then was, explaining the 
                                              rule said that it was a 
                                              fundamental principle of customary 
                                              law that no person shall be 
                                              condemned either in respect of his 
                                              person or his property without 
                                              being given a fair hearing.&nbsp; Also, 
                                              in Gberbie v Gberbie,34 Amissah JA 
                                              pointed out that the fundamental 
                                              principle of natural justice audi 
                                              alteram partem was recognised as a 
                                              necessary part of our customary 
                                              arbitration procedure.&nbsp; The 
                                              principle of natural justice of a

                                              involves two sub-rules, namely (i) 
                                              giving equal and enough notice and 
                                              opportunity to the parties to 
                                              prepare their case, and (ii)

                                              natural justice, ie that no one

                                              expressed in Latin as nemo judex

                                              arbitrator sat on his own cause.

                                              relied on the case of Mensah v

                                              in the case where the tribunal 
                                              acted as both prosecutor and judge

                                              and a third party seems to me to 
                                              violate the fundamental principles

                                              legally constituted court.&nbsp; It is

                                              the award and a written award will

                                              by giving different versions. The

                                              affirmed the two decisions of 
                                              Howes J.&nbsp; This was the state of

                                              without repeating the prohibition

                                              though it was valid.&nbsp; The parties 
                                              were nonetheless bound by it and

                                              enforced one must start by saying

                                              respect, the impression given by 
                                              Roger Korsah J that the effect of 
                                              a valid customary arbitration is 
                                              that it &quot;is only a shield and not 
                                              a sword&quot; is per incuriam and must 
                                              be overruled.&nbsp; A valid customary 
                                              arbitration is both a shield and a 
                                              sword.&nbsp; Section 37 (1) of the 
                                              Courts Act, 1971 (Act 372) on 
                                              which His Lordship so heavily 
                                              relies does not, it is conceded, 
                                              expressly provide for the 
                                              enforcement of customary 
                                              arbitration award, neither does 
                                              it, it must be contended, 
                                              expressly prohibit a claim for a 
                                              debt, delivery of property or 
                                              recovery of land or trespass 
                                              arising out of a valid arbitration 
                                              award.&nbsp; It is submitted that if 
                                              the plaintiff's claim is for debt, 
                                              contract or tort, the fact that 
                                              the cause of action arose as a 
                                              result of an arbitration award is 
                                              immaterial. Lastly, it must be 
                                              mentioned that our courts have 
                                              again and again stressed the point 
                                              that the burden of proof lies on 
                                              the person who relies on customary 
                                              arbitration60 as giving him a 
                                              cause of action or defence.</span></p>

                                              One of the distinguishing features 
                                              of a customary arbitration is 
                                              prior agreement to be bound by an 
                                              award.&nbsp; In negotiated settlement, 
                                              the agreement to be bound is made 
                                              after the award.&nbsp; In both, the 
                                              agreement to be bound may be 
                                              evidenced by payment of money 
                                              and/or presentation of drinks. The 
                                              deciding factor is the time of 
                                              making the payment and/or the

                                              (ii) Another distinguishing 
                                              characteristic is that, unlike 
                                              customary arbitration, a decision 
                                              in a negotiated settlement need 
                                              not be on the respective merits of 
                                              the claims of the contestants. In 
                                              a negotiated settlement &quot;King 
                                              Solomon is come to judgment.&quot; 
                                              There is give and take and the 
                                              main aim is to reconcile the 
                                              parties by offering them what is 
                                              fair and reasonable in the 
                                              circumstances.&nbsp; </span></p>

                                              (iii)&nbsp; And yet another difference 
                                              is that in the case of customary 
                                              arbitration the award is binding 
                                              upon the parties whether or not 
                                              they accept it. An award in 
                                              negotiated settlement is binding 
                                              only if accepted by the parties. 
                                              Normally on the publication of the 
                                              award the parties return to 
                                              signify their acceptance and then 
                                              pay a fee and/or present drinks.

                                              himself, in a negotiated

                                              Customary law provides no remedy 
                                              for vacating an award. Therefore a

                                              It must be remembered that in an

                                              the customary arbitration to its

                                              which native customary law has 
                                              been the subject of judicial 
                                              investigation; and in nearly every 
                                              case I have found that there are 
                                              general underlying principles not 
                                              difficult to understand, and 
                                              obviously based on the primitive 
                                              requirements of the community.&nbsp; In 
                                              some instances those principles

                                              departed from, as the result of 
                                              contact with European methods;

                                              flexibility; it appears to have 
                                              been always subject to motives of 
                                              expediency, and it shows 
                                              unquestionable adaptability to 
                                              altered circumstances without

                                              characteristics.&nbsp; The great danger 
                                              in applying it in this Court is 
                                              that of crystallising it in such a

                                              developed to a stage that it can 
                                              conveniently be codified without 
                                              any of the side effects feared by

                                              drafted a model ordinance of 
                                              customary arbitration which makes 
                                              very interesting reading.&nbsp; He 
                                              starts with the definition of 
                                              &quot;arbitral proceedings,&quot; &quot;arbiter,&quot;

                                              proceedings, effect of arbitral

                                              Ordinance is useful as perhaps the 
                                              first attempt at codifying the 
                                              rules of customary arbitration.&nbsp; 
                                              It unfortunately does not go far 
                                              enough to deal with some of the 
                                              problems that one has been 
                                              encountering in practice involving

                                              codification of the principles of 
                                              customary arbitration.&nbsp; In 
                                              enacting a statute to regulate 
                                              customary arbitration there are

                                              Arbitration Act, 1961 (Act 38) and 
                                              then enact a law embracing both 
                                              common law and customary 
                                              arbitration, or enact a law 
                                              dealing solely with customary 
                                              arbitration. </span></p>

                                              The advantages of the first choice 
                                              is that we shall have one law or 
                                              statute to refer to.&nbsp; In addition, 
                                              since both common law and 
                                              customary arbitration have common 
                                              features such as removal of an 
                                              arbitrator, setting aside an 
                                              arbitration award and enforcement 
                                              of arbitration award, it is easy 
                                              to marry the two forms of 
                                              arbitration.&nbsp; It may also be 
                                              argued by purists that by the 
                                              merger customary arbitration will 
                                              lose its identity.&nbsp; We would, 
                                              however, humbly advocate a 
                                              comprehensive arbitration law to 
                                              which one can turn to find all the

                                              would advocate that all customary 
                                              arbitration awards and those of 
                                              negotiated settlements where 
                                              parties have accepted the awards 
                                              should be registered with the 
                                              nearest district court.&nbsp; 
                                              Experience has shown that when 
                                              issues of arbitration come before 
                                              the courts for adjudication, where 
                                              the parties agree that there was 
                                              an arbitration, both parties give 
                                              different versions of the award 
                                              and as often happens, each party 
                                              gets a member of the arbitration 
                                              panel to support him.&nbsp; 
                                              Registration of an award signed by 
                                              the panel members and the parties 
                                              will put an end to this practice.&nbsp; 
                                              Another advantage of registration 
                                              is that at the time an arbitration 
                                              award is being contested, none of 
                                              the panel members may be alive and 
                                              parties with dim memories of what 
                                              took place many years ago may give 
                                              different versions of the award.&nbsp; 
                                              A record of registration of award 
                                              will serve as a prima facie 
                                              evidence of what took place.&nbsp;

                                              Customary arbitration in its 
                                              traditional setting served a 
                                              useful purpose. It was a system 
                                              that served the needs of a 
                                              relatively simple, unsophisticated 
                                              society which lived together and 
                                              saw the problems of the other as 
                                              the problems of the community to 
                                              be settled in the interest of 
                                              peace and harmony within the 
                                              community.&nbsp; At a certain stage in 
                                              its evolution, however, disputes 
                                              arising within the traditional 
                                              society were referred to the 
                                              district commissioner who either 
                                              referred them to the local chief 
                                              (or in the most serious cases to 
                                              the paramount chief) for 
                                              settlement by means of 
                                              arbitration, or advised that the 
                                              matter be referred to the courts 
                                              for adjudication. The chief 
                                              regarded the reference of disputes 
                                              to them by the district 
                                              commissioner as an honour and 
                                              therefore did all that was 
                                              necessary to achieve a fair and 
                                              equitable settlement of disputes 
                                              referred to them.&nbsp; There was also, 
                                              of course, the further point that 
                                              the performance of the chief was 
                                              an important factor which was 
                                              taken into account by the district 
                                              commissioner in making his 
                                              recommendations for &quot;promotion&quot; or 
                                              the conferment of the chief's or 
                                              the Governor's medal.</span></p>

                                              It is a matter of regret that 
                                              customary arbitration is less 
                                              resorted to now.&nbsp; But, with the 
                                              withdrawal or cessation of the 
                                              incentives to a fair adjudication 
                                              referred to, this is not 
                                              surprising.&nbsp; Where the 
                                              adjudication is fair and the award 
                                              is equitable, the parties to a 
                                              customary arbitration will tend to 
                                              be happy to resort to arbitration 
                                              notwithstanding that there is no 
                                              right of appeal.&nbsp; Human nature 
                                              being what it is, no one would 
                                              risk being a loser if he has cause 
                                              to believe that there will not be 
                                              fair adjudication of his case.&nbsp; 
                                              Hence, the present situation where 
                                              litigants would prefer to send 
                                              their cases to the regular courts 
                                              and lawyers frequently advising
