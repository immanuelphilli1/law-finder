                                              IN July 1987, the first ever 
                                              conference of the Superior Courts 
                                              of Judicature of the Republic of 
                                              Ghana was held in Accra. As part 
                                              of the programme of continuing 
                                              education for judges, law and 
                                              social change was chosen as the 
                                              theme of the conference. An aspect 
                                              of the conference theme which 
                                              provoked interesting discussion 
                                              was ethics of the Bench. It is 
                                              therefore not surprising that an 
                                              important outcome of the 
                                              conference was the production of a 
                                              Code of Ethics for Judges. It was 
                                              within the framework of that 
                                              programme of continuing education 
                                              that the conference of superior 
                                              court judges was held again in 
                                              July, 1988. The theme for the 
                                              conference was proof in law.</span></p>

                                              on the popular view held by the 
                                              general public that conduct which 
                                              may be permissible in a lawyer or 
                                              a public servant or a traditional 
                                              authority will raise eyebrows and 
                                              sometimes, be deprecated if 
                                              indulged in by a member of the 
                                              Bench. This common knowledge, he 
                                              pointed out, often induced people 
                                              outside the Bench to dub the 
                                              judges as snobs when certain 
                                              offers such as gifts, invitations 
                                              or even gatherings were declined. 
                                              In such situations, he observed

                                              court No. 1 would have noticed 
                                              that we are making a modest 
                                              attempt in our own way to 
                                              mechanise our recording system. 
                                              Our primary objective is to work 
                                              out a system which is such that 
                                              when a case is tried or judgment 
                                              given, the typescript should be 
                                              available for collection within 24 
                                              hours. At the moment the system is 
                                              operating on the basis of 72 
                                              hours. There are also some 
                                              teething errors which we are 
                                              working upon. Our system will 
                                              never be effective, or command the 
                                              respect it deserves if after a 
                                              judgment a person has to wait for 
                                              months, or years before a copy can 
                                              be obtained. This is why we have 
                                              roped into our exercise in the 
                                              pursuit of judicial excellence the 
                                              rapid production of court records

                                              Turning to the theme of the 
                                              conference itself—Proof in Law, 
                                              the Chief Justice pointed out that 
                                              every court trial involved a 
                                              concept of proof in one form or 
                                              the other. In fact if proof were 
                                              to be eliminated from civil or 
                                              criminal litigation, there would 
                                              be no basis for court trials at 
                                              all. Those involved in 
                                              administration and who had to deal 
                                              with disciplinary actions in their 
                                              offices, he declared, also looked 
                                              out for proof in such matters. It 
                                              was for this and many other 
                                              reasons, he said, that the trouble 
                                              was taken to invite their learned 
                                              brothers and sisters in 
                                              institutions outside the courts 
                                              and the Attorney-General's Office 
                                              to attend the conference so that 
                                              they would all share their 
                                              experiences together. The Chief 
                                              Justice then dealt with standard 
                                              of proof, under the Evidence 
                                              Decree (NRCD 323) and pointed out 
                                              that it was divided into two, i.e. 
                                              the burden of persuasion and the 
                                              burden of producing evidence. He 
                                              referred to section 10 (1) under 
                                              which the former is defined and to 
                                              section 11(1) under which the 
                                              latter is delineated. He explained 
                                              that the burden of proof was 
                                              crucial when all the evidence was 
                                              produced. It made itself felt at a 
                                              later stage than the burden of 
                                              adducing evidence.</span></p>

                                              could also be material in turning

                                              conclusion from Mr. Aidoo’s paper 
                                              that justice should be done in 
                                              accordance with the relevant

                                              truth, led to debates of a 
                                              fundamental nature concerning the 
                                              distinction between objective and

                                              Mr. Justice Taylor regarded such

                                              that he wrote a preface to his
