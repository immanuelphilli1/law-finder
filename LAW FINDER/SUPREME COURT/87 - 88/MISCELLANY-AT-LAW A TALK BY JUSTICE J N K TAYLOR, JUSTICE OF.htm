                                              The Chief Justice, the Honourable 
                                              Justice Sowah to whom you sent 
                                              your invitation was unavoidably 
                                              unable to attend and the statutory

                                              whenever he is unavailable, the 
                                              Honourable Justice Adade is, I am 
                                              told, equally in no position to be 
                                              here and so the Chief Justice has 
                                              asked me to come as a substitute. 
                                              I welcome this intervention of 
                                              providence and I agree to come if 
                                              you have no objection, for I 
                                              understand&nbsp; whoever attends has to 
                                              give a talk on a topic of his own 
                                              choice. This means that you 
                                              primarily select your speakers; 
                                              however, I am informed the Bar 
                                              does not object to listening to 
                                              any speech from me. I am sincerely 
                                              grateful for the privilege of 
                                              chatting with you in this manner.</span></p>

                                              speech of the President of the 
                                              Ghana Bar Association. In 
                                              particular I take note of the 
                                              information he says the Bar is in 
                                              possession of, concerning 
                                              corruption in the judiciary. I am 
                                              sure as a responsible organisation 
                                              the Bar has made this information 
                                              available to the Chief Justice. 
                                              Unfortunately the Chief Justice 
                                              has not briefed me, and I have 
                                              been taken unawares. In the 
                                              circumstance I fear I am in no 
                                              position to respond to the charges 
                                              made by&nbsp; your President.</span></p>

                                              I was beset by so many real or

                                              law, I feel quite happy that this 
                                              is a gathering of professional 
                                              lawyers. Every member of the bar

                                              defining what law is and the 
                                              traditional role of lawyers. I 
                                              apprehend therefore I can talk 
                                              about law and assume without any

                                              Some preliminary observations may 
                                              serve to highlight the nature of 
                                              the dilemmas I have in mind. 
                                              Contemporary Ghana is in a state 
                                              of political flux. A flux that an

                                              has dubbed revolution. In my view, 
                                              however, law does not operate in a 
                                              vacuum and for us as professional 
                                              lawyers the nature and content of 
                                              the revolution must be appraised 
                                              before we can function 
                                              effectively.</span></p>

                                              Now every medical practitioner 
                                              will admit that before a cure can 
                                              be proffered for a sick person by 
                                              a qualified doctor the nature of 
                                              the ailment must be diagnosed and 
                                              accurately identified. Without

                                              faithful to his calling will

                                              in my view is the alleged fate of 
                                              law in contemporary Ghana. Our 
                                              traditional law is supposed to be 
                                              sick and we must diagnose its 
                                              ailment. if it is indeed sick.</span></p>

                                              syllogistic premise. However the 
                                              one undoubted feature of this 
                                              menacing state apparatus which 
                                              appeals to poor and undeveloped 
                                              peoples is that it is in theory 
                                              ostensibly operated to advance the 
                                              interests of as large a membership 
                                              of the unfortunate and allegedly 
                                              deprived segment of the population 
                                              as is possible to reach and any 
                                              hardship as conflicts with its 
                                              rigid application is pragmatically 
                                              ignored. Its unrelenting dogma is 
                                              that only what the law dictates is 
                                              permitted; all else is as a 
                                              general rule forbidden 
                                              particularly if it conflicts with 
                                              undefined and therefore 
                                              unarticulated but pervasive party 
                                              policy. This deeply embeded 
                                              prescriptive spirit of law is 
                                              reflected by Anton Chekhov in his

                                              organised. In my attempt to instil

                                              This view of mine which I honestly 
                                              and candidly expressed and which 
                                              is in consonance with the common 
                                              law philosophy of positive law, 
                                              was subjected to trenchant and 
                                              vehement attack by our mass-media 
                                              which accused me of being a 
                                              champion of kalabule. To this day 
                                              I am not aware of any logical 
                                              explanation or traditional legal 
                                              reason that can conceivably answer 
                                              the point which I made about 
                                              kalabule. In spite of that the 
                                              charge against me was brazenly 
                                              reiterated by no less a person 
                                              than a legal practitioner who had 
                                              joined the new brand of 
                                              revolutionaries who are more 
                                              revolutionary than the orthodox 
                                              revolutionaries and who have been 
                                              plying the corridors of power in 
                                              our country for some time now. In 
                                              an issue of the United Kingdom 
                                              Magazine West Africa published at 
                                              the time, the lawyer called me an 
                                              enemy of the people. He suggested 
                                              that in view of the opinion I thus 
                                              expressed about kalabule, I am an 
                                              unfit person to interpret the laws 
                                              of the PNDC in my capacity as a 
                                              Supreme Court judge. Such an 
                                              attitude must inhibit genuine 
                                              expression of views by persons who 
                                              lack the courage to face the 
                                              emotional reaction of a not 
                                              well-informed executive.</span></p>

                                              law is predicated on an

                                              The new socialist legality if I 
                                              understand it is predominantly 
                                              neither independent of government 
                                              nor of the executive view of

                                              properly as a constitutional 
                                              umpire if it is in an independent 
                                              position. If it is obliged to

                                              disposition of the judges, then 
                                              the court becomes simply a branch, 
                                              a specialised branch of the 
                                              executive and it will be unreal to 
                                              look upon it as an independent 
                                              tribunal. It would be a sad day 
                                              for Ghana if our judges were ever 
                                              to feel so disposed. Such mental 
                                              attitude in another jurisdiction 
                                              is christened socialist legality.

                                              was wholly rejected by the framers

                                              parallel law inspired by 
                                              conflicting jurisprudence running

                                              hopeful sign for the future of a

                                              The position of lawyers in Ghana 
                                              society has been very gravely 
                                              undermined by an insidious and 
                                              hardly explicable belief, firmly 
                                              normative that lawyers are liars 
                                              and therefore a bad lot and that 
                                              they are paid by their clients to 
                                              subvert the truth. So pervasive is 
                                              this belief that it has engendered 
                                              another strongly held belief quite 
                                              ludicrous that when lawyers die 
                                              they are laid to rest in their 
                                              coffins with their faces downward 
                                              and hidden contrary to the general 
                                              practice by which good men not 
                                              afraid of appearing before God, 
                                              and who die are laid to rest with 
                                              their faces upward. In the view of 
                                              the adherents of this absurd 
                                              belief lawyers are so dishonest 
                                              that in their last days, they must 
                                              for fear of their misdeeds hide

                                              The very idea that lawyers are 
                                              paid to sponsor lies is as 
                                              unfortunate as it is misconceived. 
                                              That notion so tenaciously held by 
                                              our people postulates the 
                                              proposition that the lawyer is 
                                              employed by his client to subvert 
                                              justice and by his retainer he 
                                              endeavours to show that vice is 
                                              virtuous. This is demonstrably 
                                              false. It has lingered for far too 
                                              long a time and lawyers must 
                                              endeavour to dispel it at once. 
                                              Our association with law as

                                              assumed an obligation to uphold 
                                              ethical standards that have been 
                                              gradually built up for over 100 
                                              years during the interaction of 
                                              our customary laws with the 
                                              British common law in the wake of 
                                              modernising our amorphous

                                              equity, natural justice and good 
                                              conscience, the trinity that 
                                              dominated our customary laws from 
                                              1876 to 1960. The resultant legal 
                                              system that emerged by the time of 
                                              our first Republican Constitution 
                                              ensured the paramountcy of freedom 
                                              and above all justice as the prime 
                                              and fundamental objective of our

                                              prior established laws as the main 
                                              apparatus for attaining this 
                                              objective if responsibly utilised. 
                                              It provided us with an independent

                                              The lawyer under our system of 
                                              justice comes face to face with 
                                              many in-built devices that ensure 
                                              that he acts as their spokesman to 
                                              guarantee the fundamental rights 
                                              of individuals in society. The

                                              indeed from a date even before

                                              and after coming of age, through 
                                              marriage, and at every step in his 
                                              life till death and after death 
                                              are completely controlled by law 
                                              and the lawyer is a key figure in 
                                              this control which is devised to 
                                              promote the happiness of the 
                                              individual and the interest of 
                                              society. Unfortunately it is 
                                              rather in his effort at ensuring 
                                              the promotion of the happiness of 
                                              the people that some of the people 
                                              paradoxically see something odious 
                                              and strange in the role he plays 
                                              in the system when he sponsors an 
                                              unpopular cause in his 
                                              professional capacity. This arises 
                                              when he defends a person accused 
                                              of a crime of which the public 
                                              suspect him to be guilty or when 
                                              he takes a case which he and the 
                                              people think is bad. Every man and

                                              against lawyers and some lawyers 
                                              do indeed find themselves in a

                                              This problem leading to the 
                                              lawyer’s dilemma arises because 
                                              people fail to distinguish between 
                                              objective truth and justice 
                                              according to law. The lawyer is 
                                              concerned with objective truth and 
                                              the judges and magistrates deal 
                                              with objective truth aimed at 
                                              attaining justice according to 
                                              law. It is worth noting that 
                                              justice is something by far larger 
                                              than truth, and so the inevitable 
                                              question is what is Truth? I leave 
                                              the concept of justice 
                                              unexplained, because as lawyers 
                                              you all know that it is nothing 
                                              but fairness dictated and 
                                              circumscribed by case law, statute 
                                              and well-known conventional 
                                              practices of the courts.</span></p>

                                              The rhetoric question “what is 
                                              Truth?” may however be simple, if 
                                              by truth we refer to facts as they 
                                              appear to us from our own 
                                              observations and individual 
                                              knowledge and personal experience 
                                              of such facts. On this premise the 
                                              whole concept becomes subjective 
                                              capable of varying from one 
                                              individual to another. It is 
                                              “subjective truth!” The law is 
                                              very cautious and suspicious of 
                                              subjective truth, for it defies 
                                              testimony outside the person with 
                                              the knowledge and the experience. 
                                              Subjective truth is an unstable 
                                              quantity not easy to handle 
                                              because of its probable variable 
                                              and problematic content, for, as 
                                              one English judge rightly points 
                                              out, the primary evidence of what 
                                              was passing in the mind of a man 
                                              is his own testimony.6 You can 
                                              only get it from him and yet if to

                                              that they are in reality what they 
                                              purport to be? Consider the 
                                              position of a lawyer who is 
                                              consulted by a client. Let us 
                                              assume the client gives him facts 
                                              which are to be the foundation of 
                                              a suit at law. Now, the client may 
                                              tell him all the facts and even 
                                              some of the facts may have come to 
                                              the client from other sources with 
                                              the attendant danger of distortion 
                                              in the course of transmission. Let 
                                              us assume also that the case to be 
                                              made out to ensure success ought 
                                              by law to consist of twenty facts. 
                                              These facts hypothetically 
                                              represent the truth of the 
                                              client’s case on the assumption 
                                              that the said facts are singly and 
                                              collectively what they purport to 
                                              be. Now if the client makes 
                                              available to the lawyer only 
                                              fifteen of the said facts and 
                                              either deliberately, dishonestly, 
                                              or inadvertently omits the 
                                              remaining five, then although the 
                                              client has not told an untruth, 
                                              nevertheless the facts at the 
                                              disposal of the lawyer will not be 
                                              sufficient to enable him to arrive 
                                              at the truth, and the conclusion 
                                              he draws from the fifteen facts 
                                              may be false through no fault of 
                                              the lawyer.</span></p>

                                              In such a situation to accuse the 
                                              lawyer of sponsoring falsehood, 
                                              is, I venture to think not fair or 
                                              proper. Even if the client 
                                              purports to give the twenty facts 
                                              and one or two are not what they 
                                              seem to be the conclusion based on 
                                              the proffered twenty facts will 
                                              also be false. The problem may be 
                                              compounded by the further fact 
                                              that the client may not be 
                                              deliberately attempting to mislead 
                                              the lawyer. He may himself have 
                                              been mistaken in his grasp or 
                                              observation of the said facts: 
                                              furthermore from ignorance of the 
                                              requirements of the law, he may 
                                              have misconceived the importance 
                                              and relevance of the omitted 
                                              facts. This is why the law arms 
                                              the lawyer with the very powerful 
                                              weapon of cross-examination to 
                                              enable truth to be elicited and it 
                                              is equally the reason why the law 
                                              insists that witnesses must swear 
                                              to tell the truth, the whole truth 
                                              and nothing but the truth. 
                                              Obviously a statement which is 
                                              literally true but conveys a 
                                              substantially false impression 
                                              because of deliberate and 
                                              significant omissions may very 
                                              well constitute false 
                                              representation. As Lord Chelmsford 
                                              delivering his speech in the House 
                                              of Lords said in Peek v Gurney, in 
                                              1873: “Half the truth will 
                                              sometimes amount to a real 
                                              falsehood.”7</span></p>

                                              The overall picture I have thus 
                                              delineated shows that no one can 
                                              guarantee with absolute certainty 
                                              the infallibility of objective 
                                              truth, and yet it is want 
                                              objective truth that the lawyers 
                                              and judges operate the legal 
                                              system. The lawyers, judges and 
                                              magistrates are not themselves 
                                              present when the facts, the

                                              mistaken the inferences may be 
                                              false: if the witnesses are bent 
                                              on telling lies the conclusions 
                                              may also be false and if the 
                                              presiding judge or magistrate 
                                              either carelessly or inadvertently 
                                              having regard to the fact that 
                                              mankind is not above making 
                                              mistakes, draw wrong inferences 
                                              from the facts, then the 
                                              conclusions, although liable to be

                                              particularly the lawyers of 
                                              dishonesty because of the nature 
                                              as well as the inherent weakness

                                              It is my well-considered opinion 
                                              that this belief and erroneous 
                                              view so embarrassing to lawyers, 
                                              creates a dilemma and conscience

                                              representing unpopular causes. And 
                                              in a country like Ghana we must 
                                              appreciate that sycophancy and 
                                              pandering to the official view is 
                                              fast becoming fashionable and 
                                              often the common past-time of the 
                                              failures in our society who walk 
                                              the corridors of power, kowtowing 
                                              to officialdom, fawning for 
                                              favours and largesse and fanning 
                                              the flames of tendentious popular 
                                              views which they imagine the 
                                              wielders of power are probably 
                                              holding. It seems to me that every 
                                              leader we have had from the 
                                              indefatigable Nkrumah, to the 
                                              revolutionary JJ have not been 
                                              isolated from these political 
                                              parasites, and the downfall of 
                                              many a leader can be traced to 
                                              over-dependance on their 
                                              irresponsible and selfish antics. 
                                              Perhaps we need an institutional 
                                              mechanism to protect our national

                                              shameless ruffians. This is 
                                              necessary because by the 
                                              experience of hind-sight it is 
                                              possible to know the reality that 
                                              motivates and is behind these 
                                              merchants of evil and nation 
                                              wreckers. Consider their past

                                              reminiscent of the horrors of the 
                                              nazi propaganda machine: note how 
                                              they attempt to manipulate our 
                                              leaders: Nkrumah is the Osagyefo

                                              Nigeria were members to inform the

                                              to break up. “For four years,” he

                                              been asked to enquire from Ghana 
                                              whether it could host the 6th 
                                              Biennial Conference in March 1989 
                                              as promised? Nigeria and Ghana are 
                                              all involved and I want an 
                                              assurance that Ghana is prepared 
                                              to host the conference in March 
                                              1989. If Ghana should decline then 
                                              Nigeria is prepared to take it

                                              military rule all these years. 
                                              They know how to remove a 
                                              government which has become 
                                              unpopular. This is interwoven with 
                                              their political culture. 
                                              Politicians have their pitfalls 
                                              and are bound to make errors, but 
                                              it is not military intervention 
                                              that can solve the problem, nor 
                                              the solution being military 
                                              intervention. This has gone into 
                                              the political culture of the 
                                              peoples of those countries.

                                              should be able to point out to the 
                                              military to confine themselves to 
                                              their legitimate functions of 
                                              prevention of outside invasion and

                                              Nigeria is now facing the same 
                                              problems. The country is heavily 
                                              in debt incurred by former 
                                              military men. The military should 
                                              know that civilians are also 
                                              patriots and not they alone. The 
                                              military men who came to power in 
                                              Nigeria are all now millionaires 
                                              and one may ask, from where did 
                                              they get the money?</span></p>

                                              What Africans should do now is to 
                                              work towards the elimination of 
                                              those negative aspects of our 
                                              culture which tend to invite 
                                              military interventions. Nigerians 
                                              are now asking how the problem can 
                                              be solved. It is for the people to 
                                              be bold enough to tell the 
                                              military men to return to the 
                                              barracks and leave the running of 
                                              government to the politicians who 
                                              are trained to do so.”</span></p>
