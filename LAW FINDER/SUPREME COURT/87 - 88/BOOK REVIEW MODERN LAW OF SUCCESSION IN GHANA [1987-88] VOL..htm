                                              HERE is another well-researched 
                                              publication from Dr Kludze. His 
                                              aim was &quot;to write a book which is 
                                              suitable for legal practitioners 
                                              but which also satisfies the 
                                              instructional requirements of law 
                                              students.&quot; This should be borne in 
                                              mind in reading the review here 
                                              attempted. The twelve chapters of 
                                              the book cover practically all the 
                                              areas which a practitioner would 
                                              expect: wills, both statutory and 
                                              according to customary law, 
                                              succession under the laws of 
                                              intestacy, including the Intestate 
                                              Succession Law, 1985 (PNDCL 111), 
                                              the Marriage Ordinance (Cap 127), 
                                              the Marriage of Mohammedans 
                                              Ordinance (Cap 129), and the 
                                              traditional customary law, not 
                                              forgetting his own distinction 
                                              between the &quot;practised customary 
                                              law&quot; and the &quot;judicial customary 
                                              law&quot;, and some related matters of 
                                              family law.</span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

                                              The first half of the book takes 
                                              the reader through discussions and 
                                              analyses of the Wills Act, 1971 
                                              (Act 360) and wills under 
                                              customary law that are quite 
                                              satisfactory.&nbsp; There is no doubt 
                                              that many will find these very 
                                              instructive. And the second half 
                                              which deals with the other forms 
                                              of succession is even more 
                                              stimulating, though several of the 
                                              opinions there stated have been 
                                              published in the author's earlier 
                                              book, Ewe Law of Property (1973) 
                                              and articles in journals published 
                                              in this country. Many are the 
                                              comments that Dr Kludze makes on 
                                              the earlier writers in this 
                                              field—to make them in the order of 
                                              prominence in his book, N A 
                                              Ollennu, K Bentsi-Enchill, J M 
                                              Sarbah, J B Danquah and R S 
                                              Rattray.&nbsp; Some of the views 
                                              expressed by these writers are, 
                                              says our author, with respect, 
                                              wrong; and he then states the 
                                              arguments in favour of the views 
                                              he prefers. Some other views of 
                                              theirs, sometimes supported by 
                                              decisions of the courts, are, if 
                                              we may put a phrase of Sir Henry 
                                              Maine's in our author's mouth, 
                                              &quot;plausible and comprehensive, but 
                                              absolutely unverified.”&nbsp; The rest 
                                              are endorsed, with reasons. Very 
                                              many practitioners who read this 
                                              book will feel invited to 
                                              reconsider the familiar views on 
                                              which countless cases have been 
                                              argued and decided in our courts. 
                                              That seems to be a really great 
                                              virtue in a book of this kind. It 
                                              need not mean that all readers 
                                              will agree with the views 
                                              expressed by Dr Kludze. One may, 
                                              for instance, find these questions 
                                              teasing. It is said at page 7 that 
                                              section 40 (1) of the English Law 
                                              of Property Act, 1925, is &quot;now 
                                              applicable in Ghana&quot;; but is it? 
                                              Practitioners are familiar with 
                                              the rule in Parker v Felgate 
                                              (1883) to the effect that if a 
                                              testator was competent when he 
                                              gave instructions to his solicitor 
                                              to prepare his will and the will 
                                              is prepared according to those 
                                              instructions, the will is valid 
                                              even if the testator become 
                                              incompetent at the time of its 
                                              actual execution. Will they agree 
                                              with Dr Kludze (pp 25-26) that 
                                              &quot;our courts should construe the 
                                              provisions (in our Wills Act, 
                                              1971, s 1 (2) to reject&quot; that 
                                              rule? Also, may it be assumed, in 
                                              the case of a privileged oral or 
                                              nuncupative will under section 6 
                                              (1) (c) of our Wills Act, 1971, 
                                              that the required two witnesses 
                                              “must be present together&quot;? And is 
                                              the decision in Coleman v Shang 
                                              (1959) that children procreated in 
                                              adultery during the subsistence of 
                                              a monogamous marriage under the 
                                              Marriage Ordinance were 
                                              illegitimate “of doubtful 
                                              validity”? (See pp 101, and 
                                              217-218). The author's suggestion 
                                              (at p 170 and see also p 185) that 
                                              the provision in section 4 (b) of 
                                              PNDCL 111 that where there are 
                                              several houses in an intestate 
                                              estate the surviving spouse and 
                                              children have a right of choice of 
                                              one of the houses in their 
                                              unfettered discretion “be amended 
                                              to confer a prima facie right to 
                                              the matrimonial home on the 
                                              surviving spouse and children&quot; may 
                                              well be favoured or even accepted 
                                              by many lawyers. But is that a 
                                              practical solution to whatever the 
                                              problem is that the High Court 
                                              cannot resolve in its unfettered 
                                              discretion? Considering the 
                                              strange things that happen with 
                                              some of the strangers that come to 
                                              Ghana, can the law correctly be 
                                              that &quot;a Ghanaian domicil will not 
                                              be acquired through a temporary 
                                              sojourn in Ghana by a foreigner”? 
                                              (p 176 on s.11(2) of PNDCL 111). 
                                              More, can it be said correctly, as 
                                              Dr Kludze says in p 190, that 
                                              &quot;there will . . . continue to be 
                                              doubts whether adoption is known 
                                              to customary law&quot;?&nbsp; Judging from 
                                              his own analysis of dicta from the 
                                              cases in pp 251-252 it does seem 
                                              that there will not be much 
                                              difficulty in persuading him to 
                                              modify that view. It is, however, 
                                              admitted that throughout Dr Kludze 
                                              argues his submission with 
                                              conviction and will usually carry 
                                              readers with him.</span></p>

                                              There are many other qualities of 
                                              this book which your reviewer 
                                              commends. I mention only a few 
                                              examples here. Under the 
                                              sub-heading “Meaning of Particular 
                                              Words” (p 105) the brief 
                                              introductory comments on the 
                                              chosen words will undoubtedly be 
                                              found helpful by many magistrates 
                                              and judges, not to mention 
                                              practitioners and students. Dr 
                                              Kludze draws attention (p 115) to 
                                              the seeming inconsistency of 
                                              several statutory provisions on 
                                              the commorientes rule in Ghana and 
                                              makes suggestions for improvement 
                                              by statutory intervention which 
                                              are very practical. Then he gives 
                                              a satisfactory review of the state 
                                              of the law on samansiw to date (pp 
                                              130-160), dealing with the formal 
                                              requirements therefore and other 
                                              related matters. And generally his 
                                              criticisms of several provisions 
                                              of PNDCL 111 are well grounded, 
                                              fair and practical (see pp 163, 
                                              165, 181-187, 190, 194-195,

                                              that all of them will be carefully 
                                              considered by those responsible

                                              Equal attention may now be given 
                                              to the short-comings of the book. 
                                              To start from small beginnings, it 
                                              appears that at p 9 (3rd sentence) 
                                              there is an intruding &quot;not&quot; after 
                                              &quot;may&quot;. In the discussion on 
                                              attestation of wills (p 45) it 
                                              would have been helpful to cite 
                                              Order 60, rules 25 and 26 of our 
                                              Court Rules; and the author's 
                                              recommendation that the principle 
                                              of &quot;conscious presence&quot; be adopted 
                                              by our courts should have been 
                                              argued a little more. At p 57 
                                              there appears a note 95 in which 
                                              some expected figures do not 
                                              appear. And do we still have in 
                                              practice (ie “on the ground&quot;) any 
                                              “Border Guards” in Ghana? (pp 61, 
                                              62 and 65). Should we not now 
                                              consider also whether soldiers 
                                              engaged in a coup d'etat (not only 
                                              on restoration of public order 
                                              thereafter) should be regarded as

                                              privileged wills our author refers 
                                              to Re Lartey [1972] 2 GLR 488 and 
                                              states (correctly, I think) that

                                              objectionable on the ground that 
                                              it constitutes an implied 
                                              compromise of national sovereignty 
                                              by allowing the English Parliament 
                                              to legislate for an independent 
                                              Ghana. Sovereignty should not be 
                                              compromised indirectly through the 
                                              interpretation or application of 
                                              colonial statutes&quot;.&nbsp; It may be 
                                              wondered whether he was serious 
                                              here; for not many practitioners 
                                              will take that view of legislation 
                                              from the British Parliament. (I 
                                              have actually cross-checked with 
                                              ten practitioners chosen at random 
                                              and while three found the argument 
                                              interesting, none of them said it 
                                              was convincing).</span></p>

                                              There is one thing your reviewer 
                                              found unfortunate: namely, that Dr 
                                              Kludze used up so much space (pp 
                                              151-156) on a &quot;brief effort to 
                                              elaborate on ... a simple logical 
                                              commentary.&quot; It was really a reply 
                                              to a criticism by Dr Dankwa of an 
                                              earlier article in which our 
                                              author had expressed the view that 
                                              . . . &quot;it is a conceivable 
                                              position that the emergence of 
                                              private property preceded the 
                                              making of wills but that wills are 
                                              rooted in antiquity&quot;. I find Dr 
                                              Kludze's argument more convincing 
                                              and I consider some of the 
                                              comments there made justified; but 
                                              they could have taken fewer pages. 
                                              Similarly, his discussion of the 
                                              concept of the family, though 
                                              admittedly stimulating, is perhaps 
                                              too long (pp 237-244). There is no 
                                              doubt that far too many of us have 
                                              too readily accepted &quot;that every 
                                              man in a patrilineal community and 
                                              every woman in a matrilineal 
                                              community starts a family&quot;. The 
                                              attempt to get practitioners 
                                              re-think the basis of this is 
                                              welcome. Earlier, at p 288, it is 
                                              stated that Ollennu's view that 
                                              rule number 8 (for succession in 
                                              intestacies under section 48 of 
                                              Cap 127) could not apply in Ghana 
                                              (see The Law of Testate and 
                                              Intestate Succession, 1966, p 252) 
                                              &quot;was not correct&quot;.&nbsp; It will be 
                                              helpful if in the next edition Dr 
                                              Kludze gives us his reasons, as 
                                              usual. Next, it is really a merit 
                                              that this book discusses 
                                              insolvency, even if only briefly 
                                              (p 305). It should, however, have 
                                              been indicated that the Insolvency 
                                              Act, 1962 (Act 153) is no longer 
                                              in force. We may all agree that 
                                              practitioners' concern with 
                                              estates is mainly their 
                                              administration. In this book 
                                              practitioners receive very little 
                                              assistance, especially as regards 
                                              insolvent estates. Also even 
                                              before we come to that, many would 
                                              welcome a consideration of the 
                                              requirements of registration of 
                                              &quot;spouses&quot; under the Customary

                                              112), which unfortunately is not 
                                              mentioned at all in this book, on 
                                              the whole question of succession 
                                              and inheritance.</span></p>

                                              Finally, in this section, it 
                                              should be pointed out that there 
                                              are many printer's errors. In the

                                              is misspelt; at p 18 there is &quot;of&quot; 
                                              instead of &quot;or&quot; in section 3 of

                                              the English statute, the

                                              wrongly described in note 5. At p 
                                              76 the year stated to be 1972 in

                                              Margaret Field on p 296 in which 
                                              the word “unfaithful” can surely

                                              unfaithful”?). Lastly, on p 303 
                                              the word “therefore” must be 
                                              corrected to “therefor”.&nbsp; Now,

                                              Your reviewer is happy to be able 
                                              to say that none of these 
                                              printer’s errors actually 
                                              interrupts the enjoyment of the 
                                              book. The language flows. The 
                                              arguments are stimulating.&nbsp; And 
                                              the submissions are made with 
                                              agreeable force. Dr. A K P 
                                              Kludze’s book deserves every 
                                              minute spent in reading it. I 
                                              recommend it highly to legal 
                                              practitioners (including judges 
                                              and magistrates, all)—and, yes, to 
                                              law students also; for it is the 
                                              sort of book which every student 
                                              will find very helpful while 
                                              examinations are ahead and which 
                                              he or she will be happy to own for 
                                              many years thereafter in practice.</span></td>
