                                              legal practitioner asked to 
                                              address judges on any matter 
                                              connected with trials does so, as 
                                              I do now, with some perturbation 
                                              of mind. But that is nothing 
                                              compared with the often clearly 
                                              visible trepidation with which a 
                                              witness (whether a party or not) 
                                              usually enters the box to give 
                                              evidence in a case proceeding in a 
                                              court of law. It is easy for those 
                                              of us who are familiar with the 
                                              court environment to overlook the 
                                              hostile and threatening atmosphere 
                                              which it generates. Some effort 
                                              should therefore be made by us, 
                                              both judges and practitioners, to 
                                              pay some attention to that fact. 
                                              Another thing we are often 
                                              reminded of is that in addressing 
                                              judges, especially when arguing 
                                              appeals, we should not lecture 
                                              them. Superior court judges are of 
                                              course all appellate judges. So 
                                              this paper will endeavour not to 
                                              sound as a lecture—we will almost 
                                              be chatting. And we will not be 
                                              considering the rules of law on 
                                              our subject in any detail. 
                                              Afterall the law, as we are all 
                                              presumed to know, is in the bosoms 
                                              of your lordships and ladyships.</span></p>

                                              Now, a witness who comes to court 
                                              to give evidence begins by being 
                                              led through an 
                                              examination-in-chief. The object 
                                              here, according to the books, is 
                                              “to obtain testimony in support of 
                                              the version of the facts in issue 
                                              or relevant to the issue for which 
                                              the party calling the witness 
                                              contends.” (Speaker’s emphasis.) 
                                              It is at this point that he 
                                              narrates all of what he knows of 
                                              those facts which the counsel who 
                                              called him considers relevant and 
                                              otherwise important. And if he has 
                                              obtained any documents or 
                                              instruments or other such 
                                              materials that will support the 
                                              version of the facts being 
                                              presented, he tenders those too in 
                                              evidence to the tribunal. However, 
                                              in this discussion paper we will 
                                              concern ourselves not so much with 
                                              an examination or critique of the 
                                              relevant laws as with how the 
                                              examination-in-chief should be 
                                              conducted by the persons involved 
                                              in the proceedings of helping in 
                                              or making the decisions in 
                                              particular cases.</span></p>

                                              For in examination-in-chief, 
                                              counsel’s first concern is: in 
                                              what order may I call my witnesses 
                                              so that my client’s case will be 
                                              presented to its best advantage? 
                                              Fortunately, at this point the law 
                                              presents no problem—counsel may 
                                              call his witnesses in any order 
                                              that seems likely to be 
                                              satisfactory to him (and his 
                                              client). When the witness is in 
                                              the box, counsel’s next concern 
                                              shows: how should the witness tell 
                                              his story? A lot of persons 
                                              knowledgeable in such matters who 
                                              comment on this, recommend that 
                                              the witness should be made to tell 
                                              his story in a chronological 
                                              order. No doubt this is true in 
                                              the majority of cases. There may, 
                                              however, be now and again an 
                                              occasion when it will be better 
                                              not to follow this advice. Then it 
                                              will show how carefully counsel 
                                              has prepared. Many are the persons 
                                              who suppose that 
                                              examination-in-chief is very easy. 
                                              It is easy, certainly, to do it 
                                              badly. And I have seen occasions 
                                              when counsel has done an 
                                              examination-in-chief and sat down 
                                              with apparent satisfaction when 
                                              several of us at the bar (hearing 
                                              that witness for the first time, 
                                              like the judge and/or jury) were 
                                              not clear what version of the 
                                              facts was meant to be conveyed, 
                                              and we have wondered whether the 
                                              judge and/or jury have got that. 
                                              Of course it is the case that a 
                                              witness should be left to give his 
                                              own evidence, since, as we know, 
                                              counsel is not allowed to put 
                                              leading questions in 
                                              evidence-in-chief. But we also 
                                              know that at all times it is 
                                              desirable that the witness should 
                                              remain under counsel’s control. 
                                              Merely to say “will you now tell 
                                              your story?” or “will you now give 
                                              your evidence?” is not enough. One 
                                              soon learns in court that the 
                                              witness who is left to tell his 
                                              own story does not—and that which 
                                              he tells becomes a tangled skein. 
                                              Counsel therefore soon learns that 
                                              it is wise to take his witness up 
                                              to the essential points and only 
                                              then leave him to give his 
                                              account, taking care to interrupt 
                                              (although, hopefully, not so as to 
                                              put him off his stride) in order 
                                              to bring him back under control so 
                                              as to maintain his account 
                                              precisely and chronologically. It 
                                              is almost essential for counsel to 
                                              phrase his questions simply and 
                                              shortly, and take care to put only 
                                              one question at a time. But, as 
                                              your lordships and your ladyships 
                                              very well know, we in practice 
                                              usually find this very very 
                                              difficult to do.</span></p>

                                              Probably the most important 
                                              concern of counsel is that of 
                                              leading questions. It is common

                                              There are other concerns with 
                                              which counsel grapples, even

                                              from the judge. I shall put some 
                                              examples in brief questions only 
                                              at this stage: (1) how many 
                                              counsel deal with the frequently 
                                              recurring situation where a 
                                              witness fails to come up to his 
                                              proof? and (2) has the other side 
                                              anything on counsel’s witness? At 
                                              any rate, is it not wiser to bring 
                                              out any point which may be adverse 
                                              to one’s case in 
                                              examination-in-chief, rather than

                                              bring it out with greater effect

                                              to be too personal about persons 
                                              who are still in practice and much

                                              “. . .I think the mistake in 
                                              direct examination which I have 
                                              most often noticed is the tendency 
                                              for the lawyer to make himself too 
                                              much of a witness. You must 
                                              understand that courts and juries 
                                              discount our statements because we 
                                              are supposed to be partisans. We 
                                              are professionals. If the lawyer 
                                              conducting the direct examination 
                                              asks too many leading questions, 
                                              if his questions are too long, if 
                                              he talks too much, he is simply 
                                              using the witness to confirm his 
                                              statements. What he ought to do is 
                                              to get the court and the jury 
                                              interested in the witness. He 
                                              should create an impression that 
                                              he as well as the court and jury 
                                              is very much interested in the 
                                              story and is following it with 
                                              equal attention. Lawyers commit 
                                              this error because of their 
                                              over-enthusiasm, because they 
                                              think they can state the case 
                                              better than the witness, although 
                                              the fact is they cannot, or 
                                              because they are conscious of 
                                              putting on a performance and are 
                                              thinking more of the effect of 
                                              their performance than they are of 
                                              the effect of the testimony of the 
                                              witness.</span></p>

                                              opportunity to have justice done 
                                              and not as an opportunity for 
                                              himself to demonstrate his skill. 
                                              He should try the case in such a 
                                              way that the jurymen will say: 
                                              “That other fellow is a better 
                                              lawyer but this fellow had the

                                              greatest compliment a lawyer can 
                                              receive is to have the jury think 
                                              that his opponent is a better 
                                              lawyer than he but that he is 
                                              fortunate in having the better

                                              With this in the background we are 
                                              now ready to look at some of the 
                                              things legal practitioners expect 
                                              judges to do and some of the 
                                              things they expect judges not to 
                                              do, during examination-in-chief of 
                                              witnesses that counsel has called. 
                                              But before then let us clear one 
                                              small cause of confusion, and 
                                              perhaps mention another. The one 
                                              to clear is the insistence of 
                                              several judges that their part in 
                                              the process is to find out the 
                                              truth. Finding out the truth is 
                                              undoubtedly a noble thing. But we 
                                              have neither the financial nor 
                                              other resources to undertake that. 
                                              As one writer in a common law 
                                              jurisdiction has put it, “trial 
                                              procedure itself, civil or 
                                              criminal, is not conducive to the 
                                              ascertainment of truth and may be 
                                              said to be inconsistent with it,” 
                                              aside if the psychological and 
                                              emotional considerations affecting 
                                              witnesses and others of the 
                                              participants. (See the Hon Mr.

                                              the position in Australia in 
                                              particular; and I believe we in 
                                              Ghana have even much less of the 
                                              relevant resources. In this 
                                              context he goes on to quote Sir 
                                              Owen Dixon as once remarking 
                                              extra-judicially that “the object 
                                              of the parties is always victory, 
                                              not abstract truth” (of O Dixon, 
                                              Jesting Pilate (1965) p. 16). Lord

                                              whom I admire much has said to the 
                                              contrary, that the trail judge’s

                                              the truth, and do justice 
                                              according to law” (see Denning LJ 
                                              in Jones v National Coal Board 
                                              [1957] 2 QB 55 at 63). My 
                                              contention is not that the search 
                                              for the truth should always be 
                                              abandoned. It is that judges 
                                              should be rather careful in how 
                                              they decide whether to admit or 
                                              exclude evidence at this stage 
                                              with which we are now concerned. 
                                              However curious a witness’ version 
                                              may sound it does not help for the 
                                              judge to say, as I have heard said 
                                              on at least one occasion, “who 
                                              will believe this?” Certainly not 
                                              at the examination-in-chief stage. 
                                              When Issiah the prophet asked in 
                                              the Holy Bible “who hath believed 
                                              our report?” (see Isaiah chapter 
                                              53, verse 1) he was, in fact, 
                                              insisting that his report was 
                                              absolutely true. In any case where 
                                              a judge has to reject or exclude 
                                              testimony at this stage it helps 
                                              little (except in a very very 
                                              small minority of cases) to tell 
                                              the witness giving it and his 
                                              counsel that “that testimony is 
                                              simply untrue.” If the judge is 
                                              then relying in another source of 
                                              information or a not-too-familiar 
                                              statement of a rule or some other 
                                              consideration he should at least 
                                              be open about it. As Mr. Justice 
                                              Fox puts it at page 176 of his 
                                              book:</span></p>

                                              the official Commentary on our 
                                              Evidence Decree, 1975, goes a long

                                              I cannot say that respect for 
                                              precedents has allowed our judges 
                                              to follow the guidelines laid down

                                              The matter I wish to mention is 
                                              that the rules of relevance, like 
                                              several rules of procedure and 
                                              evidence, do present traps to the 
                                              practitioner, even the experienced 
                                              one. According to the law, now 
                                              codified in section 51 of our 
                                              Evidence Decree, 1975 (NRCD 323), 
                                              all relevant evidence is 
                                              admissible, subject to the rules 
                                              of exclusion (or rather the 
                                              exercise of the judge’s discretion 
                                              to exclude any), and it is only 
                                              relevant evidence that is 
                                              admissible. This section is, as 
                                              the Commentary puts it, the 
                                              cornerstone of the law of 
                                              evidence. But it is not intended 
                                              to be a stumbling block to anyone. 
                                              In the minority of cases where 
                                              real difficulties arise the judges 
                                              are meant to assist counsel and 
                                              witnesses (as many of our judges 
                                              already do) to present the 
                                              evidence required and not to 
                                              frustrate them by making odd 
                                              rulings and adding that “you can 
                                              always take the case upstairs.” 
                                              This is clear from the recognition 
                                              by our lawmakers that there is a:</span></p>

                                              probative evidence presented to 
                                              the tribunal of fact, and on the 
                                              other hand the need to determine 
                                              disputes quickly, fairly and 
                                              finally. Accordingly the law of 
                                              evidence, in the main, can be seen 
                                              as one rule admitting all 
                                              logically probative evidence and a 
                                              series of rules providing for the 
                                              exclusion of logically probative 
                                              evidence for reasons of policy.”

                                              ascertainment of the relevant 
                                              facts (as usually pointed at even

                                              already briefly stated) with the 
                                              evidence-in-chief as far as 
                                              concerns each witness. Normally 
                                              what counsel would wish for is 
                                              that the judge allows his witness 
                                              to give his version of the facts 
                                              as pre-determined by counsel. If 
                                              the judge interferes at this stage 
                                              the witness is almost always 
                                              confused. You see, the question of 
                                              what is relevant to be proved or 
                                              material to an issue is, as Mr. 
                                              Justice Fox explains, is one of 
                                              judgment, and not simply of logic. 
                                              It is a matter upon which minds 
                                              can readily differ. The judgment 
                                              (and in the case of a jury trial 
                                              it will not be that of the person 
                                              ultimately deciding the case) must 
                                              usually be formed when only part 
                                              of the evidence is in, and of 
                                              course the evidence called before 
                                              and after will have been, or will 
                                              have to be, trimmed away from 
                                              truth—finding to the procedural 
                                              and evidentiary requirements of 
                                              the trial. In short, although 
                                              defects of human judgment are 
                                              inevitable and must be accepted, 
                                              the procedural system, even in 
                                              this fundamental respect, does not 
                                              assist the professed desideratum. 
                                              The difficulty is I believe 
                                              reflected in the tendency of 
                                              judges when sitting without 
                                              juries, and when a borderline 
                                              question arises, either to admit 
                                              the evidence, or admit it “subject 
                                              to objection.” (Ibid, 145.)</span></p>

                                              Too much emphasis on speed takes 
                                              the judge, in my view, out of the 
                                              section. For example, where the

                                              everything else that happened on 
                                              the day in question is 
                                              unimportant; and the witness may,

                                              day, leave out something that is 
                                              the basis of understanding much 
                                              evidence that will follow. Speed 
                                              is not that important. When I have

                                              Devlin told in a lecture he gave 
                                              long ago in Hong Kong. That judge 
                                              was, from the point of view of the 
                                              appellate courts, the ideal trial 
                                              judge—that is to say, he was 
                                              quick, he was courteous and he was 
                                              frequently wrong . . .” (See Hong

                                              On the other hand where a judge 
                                              makes a conscious effort to be 
                                              helpful to a witness in the way 
                                              suggested he will soon acquire the 
                                              reputation of being helpful to 
                                              counsel too, especially the 
                                              younger ones. We can all think how 
                                              that can be done. And, let me add, 
                                              such a judge will almost always be 
                                              thinking of the position of 
                                              non-parties and other witnesses 
                                              too. The point is this: as between 
                                              parties, justice in a conventional 
                                              sense can perhaps be done more 
                                              often than not. The position of 
                                              non-parties and particularly their 
                                              reputations are often put at risk 
                                              in the process. I am aware of 
                                              section 68(4) of our Evidence 
                                              Decree, namely, that a party may 
                                              object to questions asked by the 
                                              court and to evidence obtained by 
                                              the court’s questions at any time 
                                              prior to the submission of the 
                                              action to the tribunal of fact for 
                                              determination. But who has ever 
                                              heard of that section being 
                                              invoked or applied? The statement 
                                              in the Commentary that a judge who 
                                              abuses his discretion under that 
                                              section “will be subject to 
                                              reversal on appeal” is worth 
                                              noting, but is not very much 
                                              comfort to counsel who wants to do 
                                              an examination-in-chief well.</span></p>

                                              that the judge may be reversed on 
                                              appeal, considering the great cost 
                                              of and the well-known delays in 
                                              appeals. True, we have a reported

                                              hearing of a criminal case until a 
                                              stage at which he might find 
                                              whether or not it was judicially 
                                              exercisable and the High Court 
                                              judge upheld the decision of the 
                                              trial judge. (See Republic v Accra

                                              say how many decisions have, at 
                                              the trial stage, gone the other 
                                              way and have not been appealed 
                                              against? Or if they have been

                                              failure of the judge to give 
                                              reasons why he exercised his

                                              have said that “there was neither

                                              It would be unfortunate if any one 
                                              here understood that I was 
                                              pleading for all evidence to be 
                                              admissible to tender. I have 
                                              already mentioned the importance 
                                              of counsel about to 
                                              examine-in-chief preparing 
                                              carefully for it. So I am assuming 
                                              that the questions being raised

                                              that at the stage of 
                                              evidence-in-chief it is better in 
                                              those cases to exercise the 
                                              judge’s discretion in favour of 
                                              the provisions of section 52 of 
                                              NRCD 323, especially with regard

                                              have more importance in cases 
                                              tried by a jury. However, even 
                                              judges can be confused by a

                                              Even a judge may be swayed on

                                              reason. Judges and juries alike 
                                              should therefore be protected from

                                              His role during 
                                              examination-in-chief is spelt out 
                                              in section 6: he should be 
                                              attentive and ready to make any 
                                              objection “at the time the 
                                              evidence is offered.” And even 
                                              that should be under the control 
                                              of the judge. Early in my practice 
                                              I noticed that counsel who were 
                                              reputed to be good did not raise 
                                              many objections during 
                                              evidence-in-chief—they preferred 
                                              commenting on that evidence at the 
                                              appropriate time. And that often 
                                              removed the suspicion that they 
                                              were trying to shut our relevant 
                                              evidence that would greatly 
                                              support their opponent’s case. But 
                                              if objections are raised then most 
                                              of us become very concerned with 
                                              how the judge exercises his 
                                              discretion in the matter. Readers

                                              Law often remember with 
                                              apprehension his statement that 
                                              “the pressures under which a 
                                              ruling must be made is often

                                              that those pressures are 
                                              necessarily removed because the 
                                              judge gives himself or herself an 
                                              adjournment in order to “consider”

                                              law, will examine it in minute 
                                              detail, and consider it “in 
                                              relation to a particular set of 
                                              facts. In this he is assisted by 
                                              counsel, each of whom has 
                                              considered the law with care and 
                                              will advance an argument designed 
                                              to persuade the court to state the 
                                              law, even to develop and qualify 
                                              it, in a way which fits his own 
                                              client’s case . . .and it (ie. The 
                                              judge’s vision of the law) is 
                                              likely to be strongly influenced 
                                              by the facts of the particular 
                                              case.” (See the Lionel Cohen

                                              Knowing as we all do, the tenacity 
                                              of first impressions, we should

                                              why it is so important that when 
                                              facts are first presented the 
                                              judge's reaction should not be 
                                              hasty. Most people will agree that 
                                              what any person says must be 
                                              regarded as true until the 
                                              contrary has been established or a 
                                              serious doubt has been cast upon 
                                              it. And at the stage of 
                                              evidence-in-chief there will 
                                              usually not be available any such

                                              So how may I sum up? I have said 
                                              and repeated in several parts that 
                                              when counsel is conducting an 
                                              examination-in-chief of his 
                                              witness before a judge he or she 
                                              should all along bear in mind that 
                                              counsel is grappling with a whole 
                                              lot of problems on his feet—the 
                                              rules on relevance, on 
                                              admissibility, on objections, on 
                                              judicial notice, on exclusion, on 
                                              onus of proof, on leading 
                                              questions, all are difficult of 
                                              application to actual facts in 
                                              issue and facts relevant to the 
                                              issue. Especially moments of 
                                              crisis arise when, for instance, 
                                              the witness is falling below his 
                                              proof of evidence. And the judge 
                                              should endeavour to ask or say 
                                              only what will help—or keep quiet; 
                                              and if he has to rule, he or she 
                                              must always consider the matters I 
                                              have been trying to describe. This 
                                              is not just a question of courtesy 
                                              to counsel or his witness. It is 
                                              also a necessary recognition of 
                                              the nature of a trial under the 
                                              system we operate. C R Williams in

                                              “The aim of a trial is to 
                                              reconstruct the facts of a past 
                                              event so that the tribunal may 
                                              then apply the law to those facts. 
                                              Of necessity, this is a process 
                                              which can be achieved with only a 
                                              limited degree of success. 
                                              Commonly the incident or incidents 
                                              under investigation were not 
                                              observed by witnesses, or if 
                                              observed their testimony is 
                                              unreliable or conflicting. 
                                              Evidence other than the testimony 
                                              of eye-witnesses is often 
                                              inconclusive or susceptible of 
                                              more than a single interpretation. 
                                              In many cases the relevant 
                                              incident may have occupied but a 
                                              brief instant of time, an instant 
                                              which it is extremely difficult to 
                                              recapture with accuracy.” (See

                                              Ladyships, let me refer to what a 
                                              New Jersey lawyer, Gay Skoloff is 
                                              reported to have said at the 
                                              annual meeting of the American Bar 
                                              Association last year. He advised 
                                              counsel to encourage their clients 
                                              to be “creative” when involved in 
                                              division of assets proceedings. 
                                              Among other tips, he suggested 
                                              that “if the wife is claiming that 
                                              she is entitled to more money, 
                                              don’t just tell the judge that the 
                                              husband dines out regularly at 
                                              expensive restaurants, show him a 
                                              copy of the menu.” (See the report
