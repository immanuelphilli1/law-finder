                                              It is said that an effective way 
                                              of teaching a beginner how to swim 
                                              is to have him thrown into deep 
                                              water. A similar approach prevails 
                                              in the training of judges. The 
                                              spectacle of recently qualified 
                                              but untrained judges seeking to 
                                              master court work by a process of 
                                              trial and error is not uncommon. 
                                              It is not fair to the public or 
                                              the initiated judges themselves to 
                                              encourage entry into the world of 
                                              administering justice in this way. 
                                              A more primitive method of 
                                              instruction could hardly be found. 
                                              Whilst the extrovert and brash 
                                              personality may thrive upon such 
                                              treatment, an intelligent though 
                                              sensitive beginner may not be 
                                              inclined to accept the 
                                              psychological pressures involved. 
                                              Logic, experience and the public 
                                              interest all demand that judges 
                                              should, before they take their 
                                              seat for the first time on the 
                                              Bench, receive a course of 
                                              practical instruction in the work 
                                              they are appointed to do. Although 
                                              we do not have with us an 
                                              institution like the New York 
                                              University Institute of Judicial 
                                              Administration which is well known 
                                              for the important role it plays in 
                                              educating American judges. I am 
                                              convinced that this humble 
                                              beginning by arranging this 
                                              seminar or conference, if repeated 
                                              periodically, may go a long way in 
                                              achieving the desired end.</span></p>

                                              by the court or judge. The words 
                                              in which the provisions governing 
                                              each particular matter are couched 
                                              leave the prima facie impression 
                                              of giving the court or judge an 
                                              absolute discretion as to whether 
                                              to exercise the power or not. This 
                                              is because it says that the power 
                                              “may” be used. But absolute 
                                              discretion is a dangerous star to 
                                              stear by. Wherefore the law 
                                              demands that the discretion must 
                                              be exercised judiciary that is, 
                                              according to justice and right 
                                              reason. It must always be 
                                              remembered that although the 
                                              public’s expectations will allow 
                                              those exercising discretion, at 
                                              least in a judicial context, 
                                              generous room to manoeuvre their 
                                              response to what seems to them to 
                                              be an indiscretion will 
                                              understandably be correspondingly 
                                              severe. It is for this reason that 
                                              it has become part of the received 
                                              wisdom of our times that judges 
                                              should have due regard to the 
                                              wider social and other 
                                              implications of the cases they 
                                              have to try.</span></p>

                                              Let me explain myself. Those of 
                                              you who are keen followers of the 
                                              results of our football league 
                                              matches will remember how poorly 
                                              Accra Hearts of Oak had fared by 
                                              the end of the first half of the 
                                              last league season. At the 
                                              beginning of the second half they 
                                              were billed to play their rival 
                                              club, Accra Great Olympics, on a 
                                              Sunday. On the immediately 
                                              preceding Friday the managers of 
                                              Hearts sealed a writ against the 
                                              management of Olympics claiming 
                                              damages for inducing the breach of 
                                              contact by three of their regular 
                                              players who had then registered 
                                              with Olympics. In addition they 
                                              sought an order of injunction to 
                                              restrain those offending players 
                                              from playing for Olympics. For 
                                              this purpose they filed an ex 
                                              parte motion for leave to serve 
                                              their motion for an injunction 
                                              alongside with the writ and also, 
                                              as a matter of emergency, to stop 
                                              those players from being fielded 
                                              against Hearts of Oak in the 
                                              impending match. It is common 
                                              knowledge that, perhaps next to 
                                              party-politics, the league matches 
                                              whip up public feelings. Could the 
                                              public resentment (at least from 
                                              the host of supporters of 
                                              Olympics) be imagined if they woke 
                                              up that Sunday afternoon to find 
                                              that without Olympics being heard 
                                              three of their players had been 
                                              forced out of the field by the 
                                              court. This motion was rushed 
                                              before me that Friday at about 12 
                                              noon because I happened to be 
                                              sitting. But, emergency or no 
                                              emergency, I firmly booted them 
                                              out of court because its 
                                              repercussions would have been 
                                              unjust not only to Olympics but to 
                                              their host of supporters. Besides 
                                              the emergency was the creation of 
                                              the plaintiffs themselves, ie 
                                              management of Hearts, who knowing 
                                              well in advance of the scheduled 
                                              match, waited till the nick of 
                                              time to mount their action.</span></p>

                                              The practice of hauling GFA to 
                                              court by an aggrieved football 
                                              club in the thick of the league 
                                              season is a familiar-sight. An 
                                              interim injunction granted by the 
                                              court in these circumstances do 
                                              not only disrupt the league 
                                              matches which are, no doubt, 
                                              planned months in advance, they 
                                              also tend to embarrass GFA in 
                                              their continental commitments. A 
                                              case of this nature came before me 
                                              once where an attempt was made to 
                                              stop the league matches which were 
                                              already behind schedule. A week 
                                              delay in court over the dispute 
                                              would have cost GFA dearly because 
                                              they could not have concluded the 
                                              matches in time to declare the 
                                              winner for the continental 
                                              assignment. Even before I could 
                                              pronounce on the motion (which I 
                                              would have thrown out any way) GFA 
                                              yielded to the plaintiffs the 
                                              point they were after. I will say 
                                              that the plaintiffs obtained that 
                                              point by “blackmail.”</span></p>

                                              that argues out the reasons 
                                              supporting the exercise of your 
                                              discretion in a particular way. 
                                              For if you do so the appellate 
                                              court will readily examine the 
                                              soundness of those reasons. 
                                              Afterall the application that 
                                              calls for the exercise of your 
                                              discretion is interlocutory and 
                                              the display of the depth of 
                                              erudition can properly await the

                                              It must be noted that the 
                                              application to renew must be 
                                              brought before the twelve months 
                                              or before the renewed period of

                                              exercise. The discretion to extend 
                                              the validity of the writ ought to 
                                              be exercised with caution, and 
                                              renewal ought not to be granted as 
                                              of course on an application which

                                              circumstances to justify the 
                                              exercise of a discretion to extend 
                                              the validity of a writ beyond the 
                                              period of twelve months allowed 
                                              for its service; this is

                                              renewal was to deprive the 
                                              defendant of an accrued period of

                                              In Firman v Ellis (The Times, 4 
                                              July 1977) F was travelling as a 
                                              passenger in a car driven by E 
                                              when it was involved in an 
                                              accident on 23 May 1973 and F was 
                                              injured. Negotiations were 
                                              commenced and F’s solicitor issued 
                                              a writ on 26 July 1974 but it was 
                                              not served. Negotiations continued 
                                              and F rejected an offer. Further 
                                              medical reports were requested by 
                                              E’s insurers and F supplied 
                                              evidence about his employment 
                                              prospects. On 25 July 1975 the 
                                              writ expired without having been 
                                              served. In October 1976 F’s 
                                              solicitor made another approach 
                                              for settlement. E’s insurers took 
                                              the point that since more than 3 
                                              years had elapsed since the 
                                              accident, the action was 
                                              statute-barred. In March 1977 F 
                                              applied for the renewal of the 
                                              writ, but the registrar refused to 
                                              renew it F appealed and also 
                                              applied for leave under the 
                                              Limitation Act, 1975, s 2D to 
                                              serve another writ out of time. E 
                                              contended that the application was 
                                              wholly due to the failure of F’s 
                                              solicitor to serve the writ within 
                                              one year, and it would be 
                                              misapplication of the policy of 
                                              section 2D if it were to operate 
                                              as a protection to negligent 
                                              solicitors instructed by 
                                              plaintiffs. It was held (QBD Kerr 
                                              J) that the appeal against the 
                                              registrar’s refusal to renew the 
                                              writ would be dismissed; for there 
                                              had to be good reasons for 
                                              renewal, particularly if the 
                                              effect of removal was to deprive 
                                              the defendant of an accrued period 
                                              of limitation. Leave was, however,

                                              1984 that the statutory period was 
                                              not fixed on any objective basis 
                                              discoverable by logic, and 
                                              sometimes occasions hardship and 
                                              injustice. It is for those reasons

                                              beneficient provision on the lines

                                              section 23(1) will be welcomed. 
                                              After all the relevant provision

                                              adopted is now consigned to the 
                                              limbo of legal history. Nanyame v

                                              defendant was not entitled to set 
                                              it aside by a motion. The Court of 
                                              Appeal explained that leave only 
                                              enables the plaintiff to bring the 
                                              action and disables the defendant 
                                              from defeating it by the time bar 
                                              created by statute. Any other 
                                              point that can be raised in answer 
                                              to the claim, including the fact 
                                              that the plaintiff could not have 
                                              been unaware of the material facts 
                                              he alleges could still be raised 
                                              during the subsequent hearing.</span></p>

                                              consideration of which the court 
                                              must be so satisfied. 
                                              Unfortunately it is in this area 
                                              of exercising discretion where our 
                                              attitude has been rather 
                                              lackadaisical. For very often we 
                                              have allowed substituted service 
                                              to take care of situations where 
                                              the plaintiff's real difficulty 
                                              was that he did not know where to 
                                              effect personal service on the 
                                              defendant. The reasons for the 
                                              plaintiff’s inability to effect 
                                              personal service on the defendant 
                                              may be either because he did not 
                                              know the defendant’s address or 
                                              that he had left the jurisdiction 
                                              before the issue of the writ. In 
                                              either case (and especially if the 
                                              defendant did not leave the 
                                              jurisdiction to evade the service 
                                              of any anticipated writ) 
                                              substituted service cannot be 
                                              ordered because as Taylor J (as he 
                                              then was) said in Bawa v Oyegoke 
                                              [1977] 2 GLR 412, “where a writ 
                                              could not be served on a person 
                                              directly, it could not be served 
                                              indirectly by means of substituted 
                                              service.” Bawa’s case also decided 
                                              that a writ of summons with an 
                                              insufficient or no address of the 
                                              defendant is invalid and until 
                                              amended it will be improper to 
                                              order substituted service.</span></p>

                                              allow either party to amend his

                                              amendment is necessary for the 
                                              purpose of determining the real 
                                              issue in controversy then the 
                                              judge has no option in the matter 
                                              but to allow the amendment. On 
                                              other grounds for amendment the 
                                              discretion still rests with the 
                                              judge to grant or refuse it. Yeboa 
                                              v Bofour [1971] 2 GLR 199, CA, 
                                              which spells out the circumstances 
                                              when the judge must refuse an 
                                              amendment must, in my opinion, 
                                              relate to applications brought on

                                              its own motion. The power, 
                                              however, must be exercised rarely 
                                              by the court for, as it has been 
                                              said, the function of judge is to 
                                              act as a kind of umpire who plays 
                                              not an active but only a passive 
                                              role in relation to the raising of 
                                              the issues for the consideration 
                                              and determination by the court. It 
                                              is not the duty of the court to 
                                              force upon the parties amendments 
                                              for which they do not ask.&nbsp; 
                                              Nevertheless the power contained 
                                              in the rule is valuable and 
                                              significant. It enables the court, 
                                              by persuasion and if necessary by 
                                              order, to raise the real point at 
                                              issue&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between the parties, 
                                              and to ensure that its proceedings 
                                              are free from errors and defects. 
                                              In Amakom Sawmill &amp; Company v. 
                                              Mansah [1963] 1 GLR 368, SC, the 
                                              court pointed at the expediency of 
                                              the trial judge resorting to Order 
                                              28, r 12 so as to meet the ends of 
                                              justice by amending the figure 
                                              claimed in the writ to coincide 
                                              with the figure to which, in the 
                                              judge’s view, the plaintiff was 
                                              entitled. In that case the trial 
                                              judge awarded less damages than he 
                                              found for the plaintiff because he 
                                              had claimed for the lesser amount. 
                                              The Supreme Court pointed out that 
                                              the trial judge ought to have 
                                              employed, suo motu, the said rule 
                                              to meet the situation.</span></p>

                                              injunctive relief against the 
                                              polytechnic and another student P, 
                                              and on his own behalf and as a 
                                              representative of the students who 
                                              had organised the picket. He 
                                              obtained an interlocutory 
                                              injunction restraining the second 
                                              defendant and other students from 
                                              interfering with his contractual 
                                              right to attend lectures at the 
                                              polytechnic. On 1 May 1984 in 
                                              breach of the injunction, a picket 
                                              prevented the plaintiff from 
                                              entering the polytechnic. 
                                              Photographs were taken of the 
                                              persons involved in the picket. On 
                                              11 May, on the plaintiff's 
                                              application, the trial judge 
                                              ordered the polytechnic to 
                                              disclose to the plaintiff’s 
                                              solicitors the names and addresses 
                                              of the twenty-two persons 
                                              indicated with a cross on the 
                                              photograph. The polytechnic’s 
                                              appeal against the order of 11 May 
                                              was heard and dismissed by the 
                                              Court of Appeal on 14 May. In 
                                              order to comply with the court 
                                              order, lecturers of the 
                                              polytechnic were instructed to 
                                              examine the photographs and swear 
                                              affidavits, either setting out the 
                                              names of those persons whom they 
                                              could identify or confirming that 
                                              none was known. A number of 
                                              lecturers refused to comply with 
                                              the polytechnic’s instruction 
                                              until they had obtained legal 
                                              advice. On 21 May the judge 
                                              ordered 14 named lecturers to 
                                              identify the persons in the 
                                              photographs. The 14 lecturers’ 
                                              application to have the order of 
                                              21 May discharged was refused. The 
                                              14 lecturers appealed contending 
                                              that the order of 21 May was made 
                                              without jurisdiction.</span></p>

                                              Sir John Donaldson MR, delivering 
                                              the judgment of the court, said 
                                              that the lecturers relied on the 
                                              “mere witness” rule in Norwich 
                                              Pharmaceutical Company v Customs 
                                              and Excise Commissioners [1974] AC 
                                              133. Their position was that they 
                                              had not witnessed the events of 1 
                                              May and they were not concerned 
                                              with those events. That was a 
                                              superficially attractive argument 
                                              but it could not withstand 
                                              analysis. The plaintiff’s cause of 
                                              action against the polytechnic was 
                                              for discovery. It had already been 
                                              determined by the Court of Appeal 
                                              that the polytechnic was liable to 
                                              give discovery and an order had 
                                              been made which required the 
                                              polytechnic to disclose all 
                                              relevant information in its 
                                              possession. For that purpose 
                                              information in the hands and minds 
                                              of its servants and agents was 
                                              information in the possession of 
                                              the polytechnic; Anderson v Bank 
                                              of British Columbia (1876) 2 Ch.D 
                                              644. There was clear authority in 
                                              Dummor v Chippenham Corporation 
                                              (1807) 14 Ves Gun 245 that 
                                              servants of a corporation could be 
                                              required to give discovery on 
                                              behalf of the corporation and were 
                                              not to be regarded as mere 
                                              witnesses. It was not an extension 
                                              but the application of the same 
                                              principle to order agents of a 
                                              corporation to make similar 
                                              disclosure. The court was 
                                              satisfied that there was 
                                              jurisdiction to make an order for 
                                              disclosure against the 14 
                                              lecturers as agents of the 
                                              polytechnic. The appeals were 
                                              dismissed. Leave to appeal was 
                                              refused.</span></p>
