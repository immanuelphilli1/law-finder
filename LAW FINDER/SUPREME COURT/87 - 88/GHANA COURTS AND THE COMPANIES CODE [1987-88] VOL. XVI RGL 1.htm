                                              THE Ghana Institute of Chartered 
                                              Accountants in celebrating its 
                                              silver jubilee in 1988, decided to 
                                              examine the present state of our 
                                              Company Law. This is hardly 
                                              surprising. As a matter of fact, 
                                              both the Companies Code and the 
                                              Institute are a quarter of a 
                                              century old, both having been 
                                              outdoored in 1963. It therefore 
                                              stands to reason that they should 
                                              have a joint birthday party. But 
                                              certainly, the Companies Code is 
                                              not the only piece of legislation 
                                              that was introduced in 1963. Why 
                                              then should the Institute single 
                                              out the Companies Code for this 
                                              special honour and treatment?&nbsp; In 
                                              answering this question we should 
                                              find most revealing the following 
                                              statement by Professor Gower, 
                                              explaining why there was the need 
                                              to have modern, up-to-date laws 
                                              relating to companies in Ghana in 
                                              the early sixties:</span></p>

                                              great problem is to give their 
                                              businesses continuity. Almost 
                                              invariably it is unincorporated 
                                              and prove to be a one-generation

                                              accounts are, as I see it, the 
                                              principal obstacles in the way of

                                              obstacles, notably an apparent 
                                              reluctance to pool resources, but 
                                              the two already referred to seem 
                                              to be the most important and

                                              The rapid development in the Gold

                                              Coast from outside a number of 
                                              general companies. The need to 
                                              provide a legal machinery to 
                                              regulate their operations was 
                                              therefore heightened. This 
                                              therefore, led to the enactment of 
                                              the 1907 Companies Ordinance, 
                                              which was based on the 1862 
                                              English Companies Act.&nbsp; Not only 
                                              was the 1862 Act unsuited to the 
                                              special circumstances prevailing 
                                              in the Gold Coast at the time, but 
                                              even in its country of origin, 
                                              namely, the UK, the Act was 
                                              considered obsolete and was about 
                                              to be jettisoned with the passage 
                                              of the Companies (Consolidation) 
                                              Act of 1908.&nbsp; According to Gower,3 
                                              therefore, the 1907 Ordinance was 
                                              nearly &quot;fifty years behind the 
                                              times when enacted&quot; and by the 
                                              1960's it was a &quot;century out of

                                              adoption of any, based as they all 
                                              were on either French or English 
                                              statutes.&nbsp; He, however, admits 
                                              that he found the uniform 
                                              Ordinance adopted by Kenya, Uganda 
                                              and Tanganyika to be the most 
                                              progressive and innovative of the 
                                              lot and that if he felt that he 
                                              could recommend the adoption of an 
                                              existing enactment, this would 
                                              have been the one.&nbsp; However, he 
                                              refrained from doing so because, 
                                              as he explains, &quot;to a very large 
                                              extent this would result in the 
                                              re-enactment of the English Act of 
                                              1948 (admittedly with 
                                              modifications) a solution which 
                                              the government have, in effect, 
                                              already rejected.&quot;8</span></p>

                                              In the end, Gower decided to 
                                              recommend a new approach. In an 
                                              answer to his own question as to 
                                              whether the recommended rules 
                                              should be basically, English, 
                                              French or something entirely 
                                              novel, Gower states as follows:

                                              &quot;As already pointed out, the 
                                              present Company Law of Ghana is 
                                              English law-though out-of-date 
                                              English law so far as the 
                                              statutory rules are concerned. 
                                              This English law is the law with 
                                              which Ghanaian lawyers, 
                                              accountants and businessmen have 
                                              become familiar. The judges, legal 
                                              practitioners and accountants have 
                                              been trained in English law and 
                                              the English legal tradition. To 
                                              attempt now to uproot the past 
                                              completely and start from some new 
                                              sources would cause endless 
                                              difficulty to all concerned and 
                                              would handicap, instead of

                                              the Ghanaian economy. Also, it 
                                              would discourage, rather than 
                                              encourage, foreign investment.&quot;9</span></p>

                                              But the following note of caution 
                                              sounded by Gower is as important 
                                              today as it was in 1963:</span></p>

                                              &quot;This, however, does not mean that 
                                              the English law should be 
                                              slavishly followed. Nor has it 
                                              been. Though much of the attached 
                                              Draft Code will be reasonably 
                                              familiar to those trained in the 
                                              English legal tradition or 
                                              acquainted with the English Act, 
                                              it differs from the latter quite 
                                              materially in both form and 
                                              substance. My aim has been to try 
                                              to produce a Code which, starting 
                                              from the fundamental principles of 
                                              English law, yet borrows ideas 
                                              from other systems when these can 
                                              be engrafted without distortion. 
                                              And not only has there been 
                                              grafting; there has also been 
                                              pruning-and ruthless pruning of 
                                              rules which seemed to me to be 
                                              bad, obsolete or unsuited to 
                                              Ghanaian conditions. </span></p>

                                              Nor are the ideas embodied in the

                                              borrowings from elsewhere; some 
                                              are entirely novel. An attempt has 
                                              been made to give Ghana an 
                                              up-to-date streamlined system of 
                                              company law modelled to her 
                                              requirements and better than that

                                              It is thus clear that our Code is

                                              English law.&nbsp; While it preserves

                                              Let us consider briefly some of 
                                              the basic innovations introduced 
                                              by the Code.&nbsp; One of the most 
                                              noticeable is the adoption of a 
                                              Code as opposed to an Act. This is 
                                              perhaps the most radical departure 
                                              from the established English 
                                              practice. What advantages are to 
                                              be derived from the use of a Code? 
                                              In a speech he delivered in Malaya 
                                              sometime ago, reported in the 
                                              Malaya Law Review,11 Gower gave 
                                              the following answer: </span></p>

                                              &quot;The English type Companies Act 
                                              has never attempted to codify 
                                              Company Law. It has merely 
                                              consolidated the statutory rules 
                                              which are superimposed upon a body 
                                              of common law and equity embodied 
                                              in decided cases (mainly English) 
                                              extending back a century or more. 
                                              No one who reads the Act can 
                                              really understand it unless he is 
                                              reasonably familiar with those 
                                              decided cases. Many of the most 
                                              vital principles are never 
                                              embodied in the Act at all, though 
                                              often exceptions from them and 
                                              corollaries to them are stated. It 
                                              presupposes the existence of the 
                                              basic principles which it never 
                                              states. For example, nowhere you 
                                              will find a statement of the 
                                              ultra-vires doctrine; of the rules 
                                              relating to the raising and 
                                              maintaining of capital; of the 
                                              famous rule in Royal British Bank 
                                              v Turquand; of the rule in Foss v 
                                              Harbottle or of the duties of 
                                              directors. These are based solely

                                              extracted from a study of 
                                              innumerable decided cases, some of 
                                              them virtually irreconcilable, and 
                                              the true position emerges, if at 
                                              all, only when this Act is studied 
                                              against the background of these 
                                              decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp; This makes for 
                                              difficulty in England where there 
                                              are plenty of trained lawyers and 
                                              accountants and plenty of 
                                              libraries. It makes for still 
                                              greater difficulty in Afro-Asian 
                                              countries where these facilities 
                                              may be lacking.&quot;</span></p>

                                              Of codification itself, the 
                                              learned Professor was to say:

                                              &quot;Secondly I say that the company 
                                              law should be codified. This is a 
                                              suggestion which will shock the 
                                              orthodox, for codification is not 
                                              of fashion in the common law world 
                                              today. But afterall, here we have 
                                              a branch of commercial law which 
                                              should be reasonably intelligible 
                                              not only to the lawyer but also to 
                                              the accountant, to the company 
                                              secretary, and to the company 
                                              director. At present it is a 
                                              jungle through which he certainly 
                                              cannot find his way. And even the 
                                              lawyer cannot find the answer 
                                              except by delving into a mass of 
                                              alien case law. It seems to me 
                                              quite lamentable that, countries 
                                              which attain independence should 
                                              remain saddled with Companies Acts 
                                              which are only intelligible in the 
                                              light of foreign decisions over 
                                              the last two centuries. Some will 
                                              say that it would not be possible 
                                              to codify without, producing an 
                                              Act which would be enormously 
                                              long. This I do not believe. The 
                                              new Australian Model Bill is very 
                                              much shorter than the English Act.</span></p>

                                              It is by no means a complete Code; 
                                              on the other hand, it does enact a 
                                              number of rules which hitherto 
                                              have been left to judge-made law. 
                                              It sets out briefly the fiduciary 
                                              duties of the directors, for 
                                              example. In Israel (another 
                                              country which at the moment has, 
                                              an Act based on the English Act of 
                                              1929), there has been prepared a 
                                              very interesting and comprehensive 
                                              draft code which is considerably 
                                              shorter than any English-type Act. 
                                              The draftsman has achieved this by 
                                              adopting a civil law technique of 
                                              draftsmanship stating broad 
                                              principles in short pithy 
                                              sentences. Frankly, I am somewhat 
                                              doubtful myself whether this would 
                                              work in a country where the judges 
                                              and lawyers have been brought up 
                                              in the English legal tradition and 
                                              expect statutes to spell out the 
                                              law in some detail.&nbsp; Accordingly, 
                                              in the draft Code which I prepared 
                                              for Ghana, I have spelt matters 
                                              out in some detail.&nbsp; Even so, in 
                                              length (if in no other way) it 
                                              compares favourably with the 
                                              English Companies Act.&nbsp; In other 
                                              words, it can be done and I think 
                                              it should be done.&quot;12</span></p>

                                              Administration of the Company Law 
                                              in Ghana and the Government

                                              This recommendation to the effect 
                                              that the Report be made a 
                                              mandatory aid in construction of 
                                              the Code was, according to Gower, 
                                              the result of information he had 
                                              &quot;that judges would welcome power 
                                              to refer to the Report and indeed, 
                                              that it would be preferable if the 
                                              operative parts of the Code 
                                              expressly directed that reference 
                                              should be made to it.&quot;15 This 
                                              recommendation, if it had been 
                                              accepted, would certainly have 
                                              accorded the Final Report a much 
                                              higher legal status than that of 
                                              an ordinary aid in construction 
                                              under section 19 of the 
                                              Interpretation Act.&nbsp; Indeed, it 
                                              would have put the Final Report on 
                                              the same legal pedestal as the 
                                              Code itself.&nbsp; Fortunately or 
                                              unfortunately, this recommendation 
                                              was not accepted by Parliament. 
                                              Thus, as authoritative and as 
                                              comprehensive and educative as the 
                                              Final Report clearly is, it is 
                                              still to be treated as any other 
                                              report of a Commission of 
                                              inquiry.&nbsp; Even then, we must 
                                              admit, it still remains a very 
                                              useful tool in the hands of our 
                                              judges, students and 
                                              practitioners.</span></p>

                                              As indicated by Gower in his 
                                              report, the adoption of the Code 
                                              should not stultify the growth of 
                                              interpreting case law. Elaboration 
                                              through cases, he admits, is not 
                                              only inevitable but desirable. As 
                                              we shall see in due course, our 
                                              courts have not shirked their 
                                              responsibility to do just that. 
                                              Indeed, there has been developed 
                                              by our courts a sizeable body of 
                                              case law to cover the bare bones 
                                              of the Code. A cursory glance 
                                              through our law reports indicates 
                                              that our courts have so far 
                                              decided many cases under the Code, 
                                              dealing with many aspects of our 
                                              company law. Unfortunately, 
                                              constraints of space makes it 
                                              impossible to comment upon and 
                                              discuss all these cases within the 
                                              scope of this article. It has 
                                              therefore been decided to focus 
                                              attention on the following four 
                                              areas of the Code which have 
                                              engaged the attention of our 
                                              courts: </span></p>

                                              We begin with this, not because it

                                              debentures has now become more the 
                                              rule than the exception.&nbsp; The 
                                              usual charges created by companies 
                                              are of two kinds: a fixed charge 
                                              and a floating charge.&nbsp; A fixed 
                                              charge is a normal legal or 
                                              equitable mortgage over specific 
                                              assets of the company and it 
                                              usually precludes the company from 
                                              dealing with such assets without 
                                              the consent or permission of the 
                                              holders or their trustees. The 
                                              holder of a fixed charge takes 
                                              precedence over all other 
                                              creditors, and so the enforcement 
                                              of this type of charge usually 
                                              creates no problems for its 
                                              holder. A floating charge, on the 
                                              other hand, is an equitable 
                                              mortgage over the assets of the 
                                              company (usually its 
                                              stock-in-trade) but, unlike a 
                                              fixed charge, it allows the 
                                              company to deal with the charged 
                                              assets in the ordinary course of 
                                              its business without any 
                                              interference by the holder. This 
                                              concession to the company, 
                                              however, ceases to operate when 
                                              the charge becomes crystallised or 
                                              fixed. It must be apparent from 
                                              this brief description of the 
                                              floating charge that it is not a 
                                              &quot;normal,&quot; equitable mortgage. As 
                                              we shall see it possesses &quot;certain 
                                              peculiarities&quot; and the holder's 
                                              ability to realise the assets 
                                              secured thereby is dependent on a 
                                              number of factors. </span></p>

                                              learned judge first referred to

                                              which he interpreted to mean that

                                              Code.&nbsp; According to him, such 
                                              companies were governed only by 
                                              special pieces of legislation 
                                              governing their activities.&nbsp; And 
                                              since he could find in the Bank of 
                                              Gold Coast ordinance Of 195223 and 
                                              the Ghana Commercial Bank

                                              to register their debentures, as 
                                              is required under the Code, 
                                              non-registration of the charge did 
                                              not affect its validity.</span></p>

                                              interpretation of section 6 of the 
                                              Code was wrong.&nbsp; Section 6 of the

                                              submitted, are inapplicable to 
                                              such companies only to the extent 
                                              that those provisions are 
                                              inconsistent with the provisions 
                                              of any special legislation 
                                              governing the operations of such 
                                              companies.&nbsp; So rather than argue 
                                              that because there is no express 
                                              provision in those pieces of 
                                              legislation requiring 
                                              registration, such companies did 
                                              not have to register their 
                                              debentures, he would have been 
                                              perfectly correct if he had stated 
                                              that he had found an express 
                                              provision in the special

                                              To conclude therefore that in the

                                              interpretation of section 6 was 
                                              correct, it is still submitted 
                                              that he was wrong to rule that the 
                                              non-registration of the charge did

                                              because the duty of registration 
                                              spelt out in section 107 of the

                                              As Taylor J clearly established in 
                                              his examination of the case law, 
                                              the English courts have come to 
                                              accept the Davey case as a bad 
                                              precedent which ought not to be 
                                              followed.&nbsp; As already pointed out, 
                                              the Davey case is a man-hole which 
                                              the circuit court judge in the 
                                              James Town case could have evaded 
                                              if he had been more thorough in 
                                              his examination of the case law.&nbsp;

                                              That Taylor J's brilliant and 
                                              well-reasoned judgment in the case 
                                              immensely contributes to our 
                                              understanding of this area of our 
                                              company law is undisputed. We must 
                                              nevertheless express our 
                                              dissatisfaction with the learned 
                                              judge's total reliance on English 
                                              case law to resolve the issue of 
                                              priority without even a passing 
                                              reference to the relevant 
                                              provisions in section 87 of the 
                                              Companies Code.&nbsp; In so far as the 
                                              learned judge, by his ruling, 
                                              purported to hold out the case law 
                                              as the only relevant source of 
                                              law, his ruling, it is humbly 
                                              submitted, is rather misleading.&nbsp; 
                                              As already indicated, the Code 
                                              constitutes the primary source of 
                                              our company law.&nbsp; The rules of 
                                              equity and of the common law, ie 
                                              the case law applicable to 
                                              companies, are only secondary 
                                              sources of law.&nbsp; Where, therefore, 
                                              as in the James Town case, there 
                                              exists statutory provisions on an 
                                              issue, our courts are in duty 
                                              bound to apply them. Even if, as 
                                              in the James Town case, those 
                                              statutory provisions merely codify 
                                              the case law, that fact, it is 
                                              suggested, must first be 
                                              acknowledged before proceeding to 
                                              apply that case law. It should be 
                                              remembered that, to students of 
                                              law, the question of what law to 
                                              apply is more important than the 
                                              decision reached by the court.&nbsp; In 
                                              all legal matters the means should 
                                              justify the end and not vice 
                                              versa.</span></p>

                                              on 30 March 1973, by Hayfron-Benjamin 
                                              J, as he then was, the court 
                                              established the principle of 
                                              &quot;caveat professional Ghanaianses.” 
                                              The message conveyed by the case 
                                              is that professionals, especially 
                                              lawyers, who get involved 
                                              professionally in the formation 
                                              and subsequent operations of 
                                              companies must be careful in 
                                              accepting &quot;free&quot; gifts from its 
                                              companies, especially when they 
                                              occupy influential positions in 
                                              the company. </span></p>

                                              The facts of the case were briefly 
                                              as follows: Two alien businessmen 
                                              sought legal advice from a legal 
                                              practitioner and his senior 
                                              partner which led to the formation 
                                              of the company of which the two 
                                              men and the senior partner became 
                                              the shareholders and directors. 
                                              The legal practitioner was first 
                                              appointed the paid solicitor 
                                              secretary to the company and 
                                              later, on the advice of his senior 
                                              partner cum director, was made a 
                                              director and also given free 
                                              shares by the company. No general 
                                              meeting was held, nor was there a 
                                              resolution of a general meeting to 
                                              support the legal practitioner's 
                                              appointment as a director or his 
                                              acquisition of free shares.&nbsp;
                                              </span></p>

                                              One of the businessmen applied 
                                              under section 218 alleging that 
                                              the manner of appointment of the 
                                              legal practitioner and the 
                                              redistribution of shares amounted 
                                              to an oppressive action against 
                                              him.&nbsp; The court ruled that the 
                                              solicitor-client relationship was 
                                              a fiduciary one imposing special 
                                              obligations on the solicitor. In 
                                              his dealings with the client, the 
                                              solicitor must exercise the utmost 
                                              good faith, and that transactions 
                                              between him and his client should 
                                              not be upheld unless it could be 
                                              established that they were 
                                              effected by the exercise of the 
                                              client's will and without 
                                              influence on the part of the 
                                              solicitor.&nbsp; Since the legal 
                                              practitioner's appointment as 
                                              director and the giving of the 
                                              shares to him, observed the court, 
                                              were effected on the advice of his 
                                              senior partner, who was also a 
                                              director, the advice given to the 
                                              company could not be independent 
                                              legal advice without influence.&nbsp; 
                                              The court therefore held that 
                                              there was oppressive conduct on 
                                              the part of the senior partner and 
                                              therefore made an order setting 
                                              aside the legal practitioner's 
                                              appointment as director and 
                                              declaring invalid his acquisition 
                                              of &quot;free&quot; shares.&nbsp; </span></p>

                                              judgment leads one to conclude 
                                              that the learned judge would have 
                                              extended the principle to cover 
                                              the senior partner also if he had 
                                              been given the chance: </span></p>

                                              &quot;The circumstances under which he 
                                              became a director at the outset of

                                              against his directorship or his

                                              make no order in these proceedings

                                              It is indeed difficult to 
                                              challenge this decision on any 
                                              legal grounds. And the principle 
                                              established there is wide enough 
                                              to cover all professionals, 
                                              including accountants, who stand

                                              moral in this case is that 
                                              professionals must beware of their 
                                              clients when they come bearing

                                              as indicated in later cases, was 
                                              wrong.&nbsp; Though our section 218 is 
                                              similar to section 210 of the 
                                              English Companies Act, 1948, the 
                                              two provisions are by no means the 
                                              same.&nbsp; As Gower indicates in his 
                                              report,38 our section 218 is much 
                                              wider in scope than its English 
                                              counterpart under section 210, and 
                                              this is the result of his adoption 
                                              of &quot;much of the wording 
                                              recommended by the Irish 
                                              Committee,39 &quot; which had been 
                                              highly critical of the actual 
                                              wording of the English section.&nbsp; 
                                              Thus, while under section 210 of 
                                              the 1948 English Act, correctly

                                              indeed.&nbsp; It simply says that where 
                                              the powers of the directors are 
                                              being exercised in an oppressive

                                              court under section 218 (1) (a)? 
                                              It is clear that a member of

                                              also think that where the powers 
                                              of the directors are being 
                                              exercised in disregard of the

                                              company, such an officer who is a 
                                              member can equally proceed under 
                                              the section. And an officer has 
                                              been defined in relation to body

                                              Another v Plastico Ltd (No 2).51 
                                              The facts of the case were briefly 
                                              as follows: A company was formed 
                                              by P and M who were its only 
                                              shareholders and directors.&nbsp; P was 
                                              also the Managing Director.&nbsp; The 
                                              company was registered with 5,000 
                                              ordinary shares, of which P held 
                                              2,850 and M, the remaining 2,150. 
                                              P died and M, the surviving 
                                              shareholder-cum-director, 
                                              purported to hold a meeting with 
                                              the company's secretary in 
                                              attendance and appointed K a 
                                              director of the company and 
                                              allocated him one of his (M's) 
                                              shares. No notices were issued for 
                                              the meeting, and there was no 
                                              quorum at the meeting, as required 
                                              by the company's regulations.&nbsp; 
                                              Later M unilaterally increased the 
                                              company's shares and increased his 
                                              own shareholding from 2,150 to 
                                              5,999 while allocating 74 shares 
                                              to K. Around the same time, the 
                                              applicants in the case obtained 
                                              letters of administration to 
                                              administer P's estate and were 
                                              later registered as members. They 
                                              then applied for a declaration 
                                              that the appointment of K as 
                                              director and the transfer of 
                                              shares to him were null and void.

                                              On the first issue, namely K's 
                                              appointment as director, the 
                                              learned judge ruled that the 
                                              purported meeting was irregular on 
                                              the grounds that (1) it lacked the 
                                              required notice even though it was 
                                              explainable on the ground that 
                                              there was no one to give notice 
                                              to; and (2) it lacked a quorum 
                                              because the articles of 
                                              association of the company 
                                              required a quorum of two.&nbsp; But as 
                                              the learned judge stated, the fact 
                                              that the meeting was invalid did 
                                              not necessarily mean that K's 
                                              appointment was null and void.&nbsp; 
                                              Referring to section 181 (5) of 
                                              the Code, which deals with &quot;casual 
                                              vacancies&quot; on the board, the 
                                              learned judge correctly stated 
                                              that this provision gives the sole 
                                              surviving director power to 
                                              appoint another to fill the casual 
                                              vacancy. The death of P, he 
                                              stated, created such a vacancy and 
                                              for the purpose of this 
                                              appointment a meeting of the 
                                              company is unnecessary. He 
                                              nevertheless ruled that K's 
                                              appointment was invalid because of 
                                              his failure to comply with section 
                                              181 (c) of the Code which requires

                                              On the question of transfer to K 
                                              by M of one of his shares, the 
                                              learned judge first referred to 
                                              the company's articles of 
                                              association, which stated that any 
                                              shareholder who wanted to dispose 
                                              of his shares must first offer 
                                              such shares to the directors of 
                                              the company at the time such 
                                              shares are for disposal. But as 
                                              the learned judge noted, at the 
                                              time in question M was the sole 
                                              director, and could therefore not 
                                              have offered the shares to any

                                              allocation of 74 fresh shares to 
                                              K, the learned judge, even though

                                              grounds for so concluding were as 
                                              follows: (1) there was no 
                                              indication that the company's 
                                              regulation had been altered, as 
                                              required by sections 56 (1) and 57 
                                              (1) of the Code, to allow the 
                                              increase in the number of shares; 
                                              (2) the increase in the number of 
                                              shares had been effected by M for 
                                              an improper purpose, namely, to 
                                              enable him acquire control of the 
                                              company, a violation by M, a 
                                              director, of a duty imposed on him 
                                              by section 204 of the Code; and 
                                              (3) since the applicants had at 
                                              the time been granted letters of 
                                              administration they were, by 
                                              virtue of section 99 (3) of the 
                                              Code, entitled to the same

                                              the Code, the new shares should

                                              It is quite clear from our 
                                              discussion that our courts have so 
                                              far admirably discharged the duty 
                                              imposed on them to see to the 
                                              growth of interpretation of case 
                                              law.&nbsp; As has also been shown, 
                                              whatever lapses have occurred have 
                                              been quickly rectified by the 
                                              self-correcting mechanism in our 
                                              judicial system.&nbsp; That these 
                                              judicial transplants have been so 
                                              successful without any signs of 
                                              rejection is largely attributable 
                                              to the ingenuity, clarity of 
                                              thought and the high professional 
                                              standards of the judges who have 
                                              undertaken these judicial 
                                              surgeries. It is hoped that, in 
                                              accordance with Gower's 
                                              recommendation, in interpreting 
                                              the Code, the development of the 
                                              case law will be kept under 
                                              constant review and amending 
                                              legislation passed as necessary.&nbsp; 
                                              For the moment, however, we do not 
                                              think that there has been built up 
                                              enough case law to warrant the 
                                              passage of any amending 
                                              legislation now. It is our hope 
                                              that our present and future judges 
                                              will follow slavishly the trail 
                                              blazed by their illustrious

                                              Finally, in the light of the Chief 
                                              Justice's revelation recently that 
                                              there are still thousands of cases 
                                              pending before our courts, with no 
                                              hope in sight for their 
                                              expeditious disposal, we do not 
                                              think it would be inappropriate 
                                              now to revive the suggestion, made 
                                              almost twelve years ago by Dr A K 
                                              Fiadjoe,52 for the establishment 
                                              of a commercial court to deal, 
                                              inter alia, with company law

                                              &quot;The arguments for the creation of 
                                              the commercial court may be summed 
                                              up as follows: Firstly, the courts 
                                              as presently constituted take too 
                                              long to try cases and are thus not 
                                              the best suited to deal 
                                              expeditiously with business 
                                              disputes. Secondly, the whole 
                                              procedure of the courts is 
                                              designed to deal with disputes 
                                              between hostile adversaries. But 
                                              this is not entirely appropriate 
                                              to most commercial situations.&nbsp; 
                                              Thirdly, litigation under the 
                                              present system tends to be rather 
                                              expensive. Fourthly, commercial 
                                              men generally resent publicity . . 
                                              . and cross-examination in open
