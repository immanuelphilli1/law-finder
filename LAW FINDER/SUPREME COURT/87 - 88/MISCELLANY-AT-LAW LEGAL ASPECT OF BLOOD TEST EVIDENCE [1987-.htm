                                              THERE is a legal debate in the 
                                              courts now about our subject: 
                                              Legal aspects of blood test 
                                              evidence. The issue is whether or 
                                              not the courts should order blood 
                                              test when faced with problems of 
                                              paternity. The contestants on the 
                                              one side are presumption and 
                                              customs and on the other, fact and 
                                              science. You will in your courts 
                                              sooner or later be faced with this 
                                              difficult problem—to order or not 
                                              to order. Your jurisdiction as 
                                              spelt out in the Courts Act, 1971 
                                              (Act 372), s 37 (1) (f), covers 
                                              “divorce and other matrimonial 
                                              causes or matters and actions for 
                                              paternity and custody of children 
                                              where the law applicable is 
                                              exclusively customary law.” In 
                                              practice this will extend to suits 
                                              of maintenance and affiliated 
                                              proceedings</span></p>

                                              The expression exclusively 
                                              customary law may seem to limit 
                                              you in your courts on this issue 
                                              of customary law, but you will 
                                              find that in arriving at a just 
                                              decision it will be necessary to 
                                              resort to the common law and other 
                                              legislation. And, in a case from 
                                              Accra New Town District Court to 
                                              the High Court, Accra, the judge 
                                              was fettered by this phrase. He 
                                              refused to order because the issue 
                                              of paternity with the aid of the 
                                              result of blood test would not be 
                                              deciding within the area of 
                                              jurisdiction vested in the 
                                              district court. See R v Accra New

                                              came before Archer J (as he then

                                              classic and most interesting case. 
                                              The appellant, the woman, claimed 
                                              that of the four children in the 
                                              matrimonial home the last two were 
                                              issues of her adulterous union 
                                              with a man known to the husband, 
                                              whom she alleged had become 
                                              impotent after the birth of the 
                                              first two senior children. The 
                                              husband denied this but was not 
                                              prepared to undergo blood test 
                                              when his consent was sought by the 
                                              judge. The woman and the 
                                              trespasser readily gave their 
                                              consent. Yet the learned judge, 
                                              after making a fine case for the 
                                              test, refused to order the test 
                                              upon the presumption theory. He 
                                              however gave interim custody of 
                                              the two younger children to the 
                                              mother, because though the husband 
                                              was wealthy enough to maintain 
                                              them, he lacked the moral fibre 
                                              and a good home (the parties had 
                                              already divorced) to keep the 
                                              children immediately. In R v Accra

                                              digested in [1969] CC 53, the same 
                                              judge had another opportunity to 
                                              pronounce on whether the trial 
                                              district court had jurisdiction to 
                                              order the test. The answer was 
                                              negative. Here there was no 
                                              matrimonial proceedings pending, 
                                              yet the trespasser had the 
                                              effontry to snatch back per court, 
                                              the child he alleged to be his 
                                              from the matrimonial home. The 
                                              judge further held that the mother 
                                              of a child could not be compelled 
                                              to undergo blood test against her 
                                              wish; and that it was doubtful 
                                              whether a mother could give 
                                              consent on behalf of a child under 
                                              age.</span></p>

                                              The Decree in section 32 only 
                                              preserves the presumption theory. 
                                              It is silent on blood test 
                                              evidence. Section 97, however, 
                                              explicitly or impliedly permit 
                                              blood test where the court finds 
                                              it necessary in the interest of 
                                              justice. Some people hold the view 
                                              that the two sections are in 
                                              conflict with each other; others 
                                              think they are not. May be all 
                                              depends on the section and upon 
                                              the particular facts of the case 
                                              before the court. Perhaps section 
                                              97 is more inclined to criminal 
                                              evidence and procedure.</span></p>

                                              (1) That the fact that a child

                                              belongs to the spouses is based on 
                                              presumption which is rebuttable. 
                                              The ordinary meaning of 
                                              presumption is “taking for 
                                              granted.” The legal meaning is 
                                              “assuming the truth of a thing 
                                              until the contrary is proved.”</span></p>

                                              in modern times that the

                                              infidelity between spouses and 
                                              other matrimonial offences; hence

                                              medicine, etc, in deciding cases. 
                                              This is doing real justice and not

                                              not, it should have before it the 
                                              best evidence which is available. 
                                              It should decide on all the

                                              wife had adulterous association 
                                              with a coloured man resulting in 
                                              the birth of a girl, the Court of 
                                              Appeal by a majority ruled against 
                                              the application of the Official

                                              see the earlier case of W v W 
                                              [1970] 1 All ER 1157, where the 
                                              majority decided (Denning MR 
                                              dissenting) that the court could 
                                              not order an infant’s blood to be 
                                              tested because, in order to 
                                              determine the question whether in 
                                              the exercise of its-discretion, 
                                              the court should order a blood 
                                              test, the sole criterion to be 
                                              applied was what was in the best 
                                              interest of the child and where 
                                              the blood test might well show 
                                              that the husband was not the 
                                              child’s father, but would not give 
                                              the child any indication of the 
                                              identity of his father, a blood 
                                              test would not be in the child’s

                                              ON Monday, 25 July 1988 when this 
                                              seminar opened the subject of the

                                              examination of witnesses, 
                                              cross-examination and 
                                              re-examination were discussed in a 
                                              most interesting manner. Mr. E S

                                              discussion and forced a number of 
                                              participants to rush to the 
                                              microphone either to support Mr. 
                                              Aidoo or to express misgivings

                                              proposition of law he had 
                                              enunciated touching on truth in 
                                              law. You will recall Mr. Kumado’s 
                                              panoramic assessment and the 
                                              contribution of Dr Agbosu about 
                                              the syllogism, a heritage of Greek 
                                              philosophy and an adjunct of clear 
                                              thinking in the tradition of 
                                              Socrates, and his comments 
                                              concerning the oft-quoted remarks 
                                              of Holmes about the life of the 
                                              law being based on experience and 
                                              not logic. This he would seem to 
                                              think was perhaps becoming 
                                              questionable in the light of the

                                              March 1978 at the High Court here 
                                              in Accra, I decided a criminal 
                                              appeal Marhaba v The Republic 
                                              [1979] GLR 90. It was a case in 
                                              which the complainant was without 
                                              doubt assaulted and injured by the 
                                              appellants and the trial court was 
                                              compelled by the truth of this 
                                              undoubted fact to convict the 
                                              appellants. In apparent confusion, 
                                              I gave expression to my dilemma, 
                                              when counsel put forward 
                                              impressive legal arguments urging 
                                              me to set aside the convictions. 
                                              My distress at that time is 
                                              reflected in these remarks I made

                                              some lawyers misconceive the 
                                              nature of the judicial process and 
                                              the legal considerations which the 
                                              tribunal must apply in a decision 
                                              as to whether an accused person 
                                              should or should not be convicted. 
                                              The crime the subject-matter of a 
                                              trial may be as clear as a 
                                              pikestaff, nevertheless the law 
                                              insists that the procedure and the 
                                              processes which it has deemed as 
                                              essential steps to be taken before 
                                              guilt is pronounced, must be 
                                              complied with by the 
                                              administrators and the

                                              If an essential procedure is 
                                              blatantly ignored then although a 
                                              person may be guilty of an act 
                                              constituting the crime, a 
                                              conviction cannot be pronounced 
                                              against him. This means that an 
                                              acquittal does not necessarily 
                                              mean that the acquitted person has 
                                              not committed the act, it may very 
                                              well mean that his guilt has not

                                              which the law demands: conviction 
                                              therefore means guilt in 
                                              accordance with what the law 
                                              demands as essential standards to 
                                              be followed in establishing guilt, 
                                              and acquittal means that the proof 
                                              has either not been adequately 
                                              established or it has fallen short 
                                              of the said standards or that the 
                                              said standards have been ignored.”</span></p>

                                              realistic treatment of the subject 
                                              necessarily covers the whole 
                                              subject of the law of evidences 
                                              both statutory and the practice 
                                              developed by the courts for 
                                              considering whether evidence 
                                              should be accepted and the weight 
                                              to be attached to such evidence. 
                                              The topic is so large that it is 
                                              impossible to consider it

                                              by the hearsay rule, confessions

                                              There are some matters which it is 
                                              not necessary at all to prove. The 
                                              court, for instance, takes 
                                              judicial notice and does not 
                                              require proof of two types of 
                                              facts. The first are facts which 
                                              are so generally known within the 
                                              territorial jurisdiction of the 
                                              court and the second are facts so 
                                              capable of accurate and ready 
                                              determination by resort to sources 
                                              whose accuracy cannot be 
                                              reasonably questioned that the 
                                              existence of the two species of 
                                              facts is not subject to dispute.f 
                                              Other facts are matters which the 
                                              law presumes. These have now 
                                              statutory foundation in the 
                                              Evidence Decree.g Where a fact or 
                                              group of facts are prima facie

                                              rebuttable presumption arises with 
                                              regard to the existence of that

                                              are arbitrary conclusions or 
                                              consequences expressly annexed by 
                                              law to particular facts and must 
                                              in fact be regarded more as rules 
                                              of substantive law rather than 
                                              rules of evidence. They are termed 
                                              conclusive presumption because 
                                              where the basic facts which have 
                                              given rise to them are found or 
                                              established no evidence contrary 
                                              to the conclusively presumed fact 
                                              may be considered by the court.i

                                              With this rather long preface, I 
                                              propose to take my contribution on 
                                              proof in trial of criminal cases, 
                                              by reminding you that we have 
                                              operated a criminal justice system 
                                              in the tradition of statutory 
                                              courts applying common law 
                                              principles for over one hundred 
                                              years. Our present Evidence Decree 
                                              (NRCD 323) is a consolidation with

                                              principles and statutes relating 
                                              to evidence. The Decree merely

                                              Speaking for myself, I cannot see 
                                              what harm can be done by drawing 
                                              on the experience of other 
                                              jurisdictions which operate a 
                                              similar system of law like ours. I 
                                              have often wondered at the legal 
                                              significance of the caveat to 
                                              renounce apposite and probably 
                                              persuasive foreign thinking in 
                                              foreign case law. The prohibition, 
                                              I understand counsels a prior 
                                              research into the availability of 
                                              local case law before recourse to 
                                              foreign authorities. This is an 
                                              exercise that can only be 
                                              meaningfully mounted if our court 
                                              libraries and our books are up to
