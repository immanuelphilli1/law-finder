                                              It should be pointed out from the 
                                              outset that section 96(7)(a) 
                                              cannot constitute a complete 
                                              ouster of the jurisdiction of the 
                                              courts to grant bail in a case of 
                                              murder. To illustrate, A is 
                                              charged with murder because he was 
                                              the enemy of the deceased or 
                                              because A had once said that the 
                                              deceased would die one day. By no 
                                              stretch of the imagination can it 
                                              be said that the lawmakers 
                                              intended that bail should be 
                                              refused to a person charged with 
                                              murder on the facts of the 
                                              illustration. The facts simply do 
                                              not support a case of murder. 
                                              Varying the facts of the 
                                              illustration, A is charged with 
                                              murder but the prosecution gives 
                                              no evidence to support the charge. 
                                              By parity of reasoning, section 96 
                                              (7) (a) does not oust the 
                                              jurisdiction of the court to grant 
                                              bail on the basis of the varied 
                                              facts. There must be some evidence 
                                              on which a court can say, &quot;this is 
                                              a case of murder.&quot; The mere fact 
                                              that the prosecution has preferred 
                                              a charge of murder against a 
                                              person does not make the case 
                                              necessarily one of murder.4 If, 
                                              despite the charge, the evidence 
                                              does not establish that the case 
                                              is one of murder, section 96 (7) 
                                              (a) does not prevent the court 
                                              from granting bail to the accused 
                                              person. The difficulty is with 
                                              determining the kind or nature of 
                                              evidence which would make a case 
                                              one of murder.</span></p>

                                              Awulley should be stated. The 
                                              accused persons were arraigned 
                                              before a district court on a 
                                              charge of murder. No facts were 
                                              given in support of the charge, 
                                              apparently because the prosecution 
                                              had not completed their 
                                              investigation. The district court 
                                              did not grant bail to the accused 
                                              persons, and remanded them into 
                                              police custody. Justice Kpegah 
                                              cannot be faulted for granting 
                                              bail to the accused persons 
                                              because there was no evidence to 
                                              guide him in deciding whether or 
                                              not it was a case of murder. 
                                              Subsequently, the prosecution had 
                                              evidence which led them to apply 
                                              for the bail to be rescinded. The 
                                              new evidence was that Kwame 
                                              Crentsil found his sister (the 
                                              deceased) in a pool of blood in 
                                              her mother's house. Crentsil who 
                                              lived in another house, carried 
                                              the sister to Okoe Awulley's 
                                              house. The latter, on seeing the 
                                              sister, pronounced her dead. Blood 
                                              stains, which on forensic 
                                              analysis, matched the blood group 
                                              of the deceased were found on the 
                                              wall and door of Crentsil's room. 
                                              That room was painted the very day 
                                              on which the sister died. In the 
                                              view of the prosecution, the 
                                              accused person could be indicted 
                                              on this evidence and bail should, 
                                              therefore, be rescinded.</span></p>

                                              Resisting the application for 
                                              withdrawal of bail, the defence 
                                              argued that bail could be 
                                              withdrawn only if (a) the 
                                              condition attached to it were 
                                              violated or (b) the terms of the 
                                              bail were not honoured. The court 
                                              rightly rejected this ground as 
                                              the sole basis for withdrawal of 
                                              bail.</span></p>

                                              Bail could also be withdrawn, the 
                                              court ruled, when evidence 
                                              supporting a case of murder is 
                                              subsequently presented to the 
                                              court.5 The court stated farther, 
                                              as Aboagye J had held in Prah v 
                                              The Republic,6 that for section 96 
                                              (7) (a) to operate, a murder 
                                              charge must be properly laid. Such 
                                              a charge is so laid if, on an 
                                              objective assessment 7 of the 
                                              evidence of the prosecution, a 
                                              prima facie case of murder can be 
                                              established. This result is 
                                              achieved if the evidence is 
                                              capable of &quot;proving the essential 
                                              elements of the charge.8 Justice 
                                              Kpegah ruled that, in the instant 
                                              case, that standard had not been 
                                              attained. He saw the crucial 
                                              evidence of the prosecution in the 
                                              following light:</span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

                                              &quot;The mere presence of the blood 
                                              stain in the room of the accused 
                                              is not enough. The presence of the 
                                              blood of the deceased in his dress 
                                              could be explained by the fact of 
                                              his carrying the body to seek 
                                              help. The presence of the blood in 
                                              the room of the accused could also 
                                              be explained in a similar vein. 
                                              The accused said his room was 
                                              painted before the incident. There 
                                              is no evidence to the contrary. 
                                              Even if done after the discovery 
                                              of the deceased's body, it could 
                                              be a panicky action. I do not 
                                              think the evidence made available 
                                              and upon which the accused is 
                                              being charged takes the case out 
                                              of the realm of suspicion or mere 
                                              conjecture.”9</span></p>

                                              Kpegah J could have rested his 
                                              ruling on these observations. He 
                                              had been asked to discharge the 
                                              bail he had previously granted 
                                              because the evidence did not 
                                              justify the continuation of the 
                                              bail. But in his view, the 
                                              evidence did not show that he was 
                                              confronted with a case of murder, 
                                              and accordingly he rejected the 
                                              application for the withdrawal of 
                                              bail. His task should, therefore, 
                                              have been at an end. However, the 
                                              learned judge went on to make 
                                              disturbing comments on why he 
                                              concluded that the evidence did 
                                              not raise a prima facie case of 
                                              murder. Relatedly, he examined 
                                              closely and accurately the nature 
                                              or quality of evidence which (1) 
                                              should warrant the committal of an 
                                              accused person to stand trial for 
                                              murder, and (2) lead a trial 
                                              judge, at the end of the case for 
                                              the prosecution, to grant bail 
                                              because there has been no evidence 
                                              to prove an essential element in 
                                              the alleged offence, or because 
                                              the case for the prosecution has 
                                              been so discredited upon 
                                              cross-examination that no 
                                              reasonable jury would act upon it.

                                              that section 96 (7) (a) does not

                                              case of murder, Kpegah J's ruling 
                                              in the instant case strengthens 
                                              our understanding of this 
                                              legislation. But he gives the

                                              reviewing the evidence in the 
                                              instant case, that the quality of

                                              pre-trial judge hearing an

                                              murder, perform the same function 
                                              as a trial judge deciding on

                                              has been made by the prosecution.&nbsp; 
                                              They all ask themselves whether 
                                              there is evidence on all the 
                                              ingredients of the offence.11 The 
                                              committing magistrate and the 
                                              pre-trial judge on the one hand,

                                              have different kinds of evidence 
                                              before them. The evidence before 
                                              the former has not been subjected 
                                              to cross-examination. Their duty 
                                              is to assume that the case for the 
                                              prosecution is true and then 
                                              decide, on that assumption, if 
                                              there is evidence on all the 
                                              ingredients of the offence.12 They 
                                              are not in a position either to

                                              of the prosecution. A lower degree 
                                              of evidence will, therefore, pass 
                                              the pre trial bail stage than that

                                              I do not see anything wrong with 
                                              applying the same test when one is

                                              decision to commit will be bad so

                                              the test whether the evidence

                                              It involves weighing and balancing 
                                              the evidence in favour of the 
                                              prosecution and that for the 
                                              defence. This role is best 
                                              performed by the trial judge 
                                              either at the end of (1) the case 
                                              for the prosecution or (2) the 
                                              whole case. In our view, the 
                                              committing magistrate or bail 
                                              judge should limit himself to the 
                                              question whether the ingredients 
                                              of the offence can be supported by 
                                              the summary of evidence of the 
                                              prosecution. A positive answer 
                                              should lead to committal or 
                                              refusal of bail. It is not being 
                                              suggested that a bail judge cannot 
                                              comment on the nature or quality 
                                              of the evidence. Circumstantial 
                                              evidence may be so referred to. 
                                              But, as has been suggested earlier 
                                              on, he has to assume that the 
                                              evidence of the prosecution is 
                                              true, and on that basis decide if 
                                              it supports a case of murder.14 If 
                                              it does, bail should be refused. 
                                              The bail judge should not decide 
                                              the weight which should be 
                                              attached to circumstantial 
                                              evidence.</span></p>

                                              through denial of bail in a murder 
                                              case only to be found not guilty 
                                              when tried, there is the 
                                              understandable concern that such 
                                              deprivation should take place only 
                                              on the strongest of evidence. The 
                                              danger in this approach is that 
                                              the bail judge may prejudge the 
                                              case: if bail is granted, then the 
                                              case is not one of murder, and the 
                                              accused person should be set free. 
                                              Respect for the administration of 
                                              justice will suffer if, after 
                                              deciding that a case is not one of 
                                              murder., a court of concurrent 
                                              jurisdiction decides later on, on 
                                              the basis of the same evidence, 
                                              that it is a case of murder. This 
                                              may happen when the prosecution, 
                                              convinced of the strength of its 
                                              case sets the trial process in 
                                              motion after bail has been granted 
                                              to the accused. While concerned 
                                              about the liberty of the 
                                              individual, the perspectives of 
                                              the prosecutor, investigating 
                                              officers (police) and the lawmaker 
                                              should nevertheless be sketched. 
                                              It is not easy to apprehend 
                                              offenders, and the bail process 
                                              should not be an escape route for 
                                              offenders.</span></p>

                                              feel the enormity of the offence. 
                                              Denial of bail is one mode of

                                              committing an accused person for

                                              scintilla of evidence. The summary 
                                              of the prosecution's evidence may 
                                              support a case of murder in terms 
                                              of section 96(7)(a), but it will 
                                              not necessarily ensure conviction 
                                              because such evidence may be so

                                              will not meet the standard for 
                                              conviction. As we have seen16 to 
                                              support a case of murder there 
                                              must be evidence on the essential

                                              evidence on only one ingredient 
                                              (out of other ingredients) will

                                              There cannot, and should never, be

                                              7&nbsp; Korsah J applied the objective 
                                              test in Seidu v The Republic 
                                              [1978] 1 GLR 65. Justice Kpegah 
                                              found it necessary to “go further 
                                              and discover what that objective 
                                              approach should be as Korsah J did 
                                              not make any further attempt to 
                                              probe the issue in some detail”: 
                                              see p 10 of his judgment. In our 
                                              view, this attempt at discovery 
                                              was unnecessary. “Does the 
                                              evidence of the prosecution 
                                              support a case of murder?” Was the 
                                              question to be answered. In our 
                                              view the aspects of Kpegah J's 
                                              ruling on a submission of no case, 
                                              turning over the case to the jury, 
                                              etc was unnecessary and constitute 
                                              the weak part of an otherwise very
