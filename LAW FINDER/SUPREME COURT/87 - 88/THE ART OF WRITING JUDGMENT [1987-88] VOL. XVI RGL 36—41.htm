                                              On 31 December 1981, the PNDC upon 
                                              assumption of power suspended the 
                                              Constitution, 1979, and in its 
                                              place declared that it would rule 
                                              by Proclamation. Section 9 of the 
                                              said Proclamation provided that 
                                              notwithstanding the suspension of 
                                              the Constitution all courts in 
                                              existence immediately before 1981 
                                              shall continue in existence with 
                                              the same powers, duties and 
                                              functions as under the existing 
                                              law subject to the Proclamation 
                                              and the laws issued under it. 
                                              There are other provisions under 
                                              section 9 which are not of the 
                                              present moment under discussion.</span></p>

                                              Delivery of judgment is in my view 
                                              the most important function of a 
                                              judge. The duty of an adjudicator, 
                                              be he magistrate, a circuit judge 
                                              or a High Court judge, is to hear 
                                              evidence, determine the issues 
                                              upon the evidence and finally 
                                              pronounce his decision or 
                                              judgment. The decision is binding 
                                              upon the parties and their privies 
                                              until a higher court overturns it. 
                                              People usually resort to the 
                                              courts because they want to affirm 
                                              or protect their rights, 
                                              properties and proprietary 
                                              interests. They come to court to 
                                              seek various forms of redress. The 
                                              parties at your level are only 
                                              interested in the justice of your 
                                              judgment. Very soon you will be 
                                              faced with greater responsibility 
                                              as proposals have been made for 
                                              the enhancement of your criminal 
                                              and civil jurisdictions. Whatever 
                                              be the nature of the action before 
                                              you, whether it be simple or 
                                              complicated, the parties are only 
                                              interested in the judgment and not 
                                              in the length of the reasons for 
                                              the decision.</span></p>

                                              All our judgments are delivered in 
                                              English, unfortunately. I say 
                                              unfortunately, because it would 
                                              have been much easier to give 
                                              judgment in our own native 
                                              languages. However, the official 
                                              language of this country is 
                                              English and proceedings in court 
                                              are conducted in English. 
                                              Therefore our first duty is to 
                                              acquire reasonable command of the 
                                              English language. If a judge can 
                                              attain a higher standard of 
                                              English so much the better for his 
                                              judgment and advancement. It 
                                              should be the aim of every judge 
                                              to endeavour to acquire a very

                                              Profession. A judge hears

                                              words are so important:</span></p>

                                              interesting or dull. Each one of

                                              improve upon it, if need be. Style

                                              Some judges do like to write after

                                              intelligible and interesting. Some 
                                              judges like to be long-winded and 
                                              rambling in their judgments and 
                                              so, wrongly, think that by writing

                                              display their knowledge of the 
                                              law. If you can do so without 
                                              obfuscation, all well and good;

                                              demeanour of witnesses may be 
                                              important and may be good guide 
                                              for preferring one piece of 
                                              evidence to the other resulting in 
                                              the judge believing one party and 
                                              disbelieving the other. Perhaps I 
                                              should mention that I have always 
                                              been sceptical of the process

                                              witnesses may be so timid or

                                              that they are liars become very 
                                              aggrieved by being ranked under

                                              it necessary to say of a witness 
                                              that he or she is a liar, the 
                                              judge must support his description 
                                              from the evidence before him. He 
                                              should not say under privilege of 
                                              immunity that which he dares not 
                                              say outside court premises.</span></p>

                                              evidence he should get counsel to 
                                              settle the issues upon which he is

                                              no counsel, the judge must himself

                                              To illustrate the point that I am 
                                              driving at; the complainant in a 
                                              criminal case gave evidence for 
                                              the prosecution against his 
                                              steward boy who had been charged 
                                              with theft of his property. 
                                              Counsel's first question without 
                                              laying any foundation whatsoever 
                                              in cross-examination was whether 
                                              or not a certain woman was not 
                                              complainant's girl friend? 
                                              Naturally, the witness protested 
                                              and asked for the protection of 
                                              the court. Counsel insisted that 
                                              he was cross-examining and was 
                                              free to ask any question. 
                                              Throughout that cross-examination 
                                              there was not the slightest 
                                              attempt to link the lady with 
                                              theft. It was an attempt to 
                                              embarrass the gentleman in the 
                                              presence of his wife. Such 
                                              cross-examination is an abuse of 
                                              counsel's privilege and the 
                                              processes of the court, and should 
                                              be discouraged. Cross-examination 
                                              should go to the matters in issue 
                                              and should not be an instrument of 
                                              oppression of a witness.</span></p>

                                              and of the High Court, the Court 
                                              of Appeal decision should prevail. 
                                              If they are decisions of courts of 
                                              concurrent jurisdiction, the judge 
                                              must discuss them in his judgment 
                                              and decide which decision to adopt 
                                              giving reasons for his preference. 
                                              It is not for the court to decide 
                                              which point is correct. The court 
                                              should leave that for a higher 
                                              court to resolve. Having chosen 
                                              your preference on issue of law, 
                                              you then apply it to your findings 
                                              of facts. But there is the rub; 
                                              for if the application of the law 
                                              is wrong the bottom of the 
                                              decision falls apart unless a 
                                              higher court finds that upon 
                                              proper application of the law the 
                                              court's findings can be supported.</span></p>

                                              There are no laid down principles 
                                              for writing judgments. They must 
                                              bear the stamp of the judge. At 
                                              your level, however, I venture to 
                                              think you can learn a lot from 
                                              those who have travelled longer on 
                                              the same road as you are now in 
                                              the process of doing. In writing 
                                              judgment, the judge's first duty 
                                              in his preface is to give a short 
                                              narrative of the parties, the 
                                              issue which has brought them to 
                                              court, and the statements of claim 
                                              and defence; but he must not 
                                              reproduce the whole statement of 
                                              plaintiff's claim and statement of 
                                              the defence. This is most 
                                              unnecessary, because they are part 
                                              of the record. It is time 
                                              consuming and unnecessary wastage 
                                              of stationery.</span></p>

                                              The judge then must set out the 
                                              issues both of fact and law. There 
                                              may be ancillary issues, but if 
                                              they do not affect the 
                                              determination of the main issues, 
                                              they must he briefly disposed of. 
                                              The judge should concentrate on 
                                              the main issues and proceed to 
                                              attack the issues arising, firmly 
                                              making his own findings and 
                                              applying the law, and coming to a 
                                              conclusion one way or the other. 
                                              There can be no drawn match in a 
                                              court of law.</span></p>
