                                              meant for use particularly in 
                                              Ghana (but generally in Anglophone 
                                              Africa and in other common law

                                              &quot;to write a book which can serve

                                              whilst also meeting the basic

                                              He has a story to tell which is 
                                              best done in his own words. “In 
                                              view of the wide spread assertions 
                                              that Ghanaian scholars do not 
                                              write books, I may be permitted to 
                                              briefly refer to the chequered 
                                              fate of this book. It is 
                                              illustrative of the frustrations 
                                              of Ghanaian authors. The original 
                                              manuscript was completed in 1976, 
                                              over a decade ago. Upon its 
                                              completion I wanted it published 
                                              by an overseas publisher.&nbsp; 
                                              However, the General Legal Council 
                                              of Ghana decided to support the 
                                              publication of the book in Ghana . 
                                              . . As a result, I was persuaded . 
                                              . . to entrust publication of the 
                                              book to the Ghana Publishing 
                                              Corporation. Upon a written 
                                              guarantee by the Corporation that 
                                              it would publish the book within 
                                              eighteen months, I released the 
                                              manuscript to the Ghana Publishing 
                                              Corporation . . . The Corporation 
                                              has failed to honour its 
                                              commitment. What is worse, the 
                                              Ghana Publishing Corporation has 
                                              misplaced my original manuscript . 
                                              . .&nbsp; Therefore the book had to be 
                                              virtually rewritten. The enormity 
                                              of the task was daunting, and must 
                                              certainly discourage scholarship.&quot;</span></p>

                                              But the work was done. In its 
                                              sixteen chapters the book deals 
                                              with most of the subjects usually 
                                              covered by standard texts on 
                                              equity and trusts: maxims, 
                                              specific performance, injunctions, 
                                              rectification, rescission, trusts 
                                              and mortgages. In addition it 
                                              contains introductory material 
                                              that gives the history and 
                                              development of some of these 
                                              matters, especially with regard to 
                                              the jurisdiction of the courts. 
                                              The language throughout is 
                                              straightforward and clear and each 
                                              argument is presented so carefully 
                                              that even where the reader may not 
                                              be convinced by it he is left in 
                                              no doubt that our author has 
                                              helped to clarify the reader's 
                                              thoughts on the subject.&nbsp; Some 
                                              subjects are discussed in more 
                                              depth than others. This too is by 
                                              design; for, as Dr Kludze himself 
                                              explains, “I have either curtailed 
                                              or expanded the discussion of 
                                              issues on the basis of their 
                                              relevance in the Ghanaian and 
                                              African context. Topics and 
                                              questions which have engaged, or 
                                              are likely to engage the attention 
                                              of the Ghanaian courts have 
                                              received greater treatment in this 
                                              book.” And he has done that so 
                                              well that the balance is 
                                              impressive. This book contains (in 
                                              chapters 13, 14 and 15) the only 
                                              reasonably full discussion of the 
                                              law of mortgages in Ghana; and the 
                                              discussion of customary law 
                                              pledges, old style and modern (in 
                                              chapter 16) is a thoughtful 
                                              addition.</span></p>

                                              Your reviewer obviously thinks 
                                              that the merits of Modern 
                                              Principles of Equity are many. A 
                                              few that readily come to mind may 
                                              be stated. The author questions 
                                              (at p. 13) the re-introduction of 
                                              the “so-called principles of 
                                              natural justice, equity and good 
                                              conscience&quot; into our law in a 
                                              manner that most practitioners 
                                              will agree with. Why, after that 
                                              foreign test had been discarded 
                                              for many years, should the 
                                              acceptability of the rules of our 
                                              customary law be subjected again 
                                              (under section 49 of the Courts 
                                              Act, 1971) to that test? Next, he 
                                              does not hesitate much in 
                                              counselling our courts to depart 
                                              from English precedents in several 
                                              cases because, as he clearly 
                                              demonstrates, our circumstances 
                                              call for such a departure. 
                                              Examples are (at p 156) in the 
                                              discussion of jurisdiction in

                                              295-296), his suggestion that a 
                                              half-secret trust be held to be 
                                              valid if the trust is communicated 
                                              to the trustee at any time before 
                                              the testator's death; the 
                                              expression of his hope (at p 307) 
                                              that the law in Ghana will be 
                                              changed to remove “this technical 
                                              anomaly” that a trustee in certain 
                                              circumstances cannot retire (and 
                                              even a court cannot release him) 
                                              from his trust unless a 
                                              replacement is found for him; and 
                                              his submission (at p 313) that 
                                              where a trustee &quot;chooses an 
                                              adviser&nbsp;&nbsp; with the requisite 
                                              expertise, the trustee ought to be 
                                              able to rely on the expert's 
                                              advice as a defence to any claim 
                                              against him for a loss incurred by 
                                              the trust estate.&quot; Several other 
                                              discussions leading to either 
                                              suggestions for changes or 
                                              clarifications in our law are 
                                              undertaken. Two instances are on 
                                              misrepresentation (at pp 213-214) 
                                              that the old common law rule be 
                                              abolished, “so that a party who is 
                                              induced by an innocent 
                                              misrepresentation to enter into a 
                                              contract may claim damages for 
                                              that innocent misrepresentation;&quot; 
                                              and on the possibilities open to 
                                              beneficiaries in such &quot;dry&quot; 
                                              matters as tracing the trust 
                                              property (pp 356-357). Older 
                                              students and young practitioners 
                                              should find all those very useful. 
                                              Indeed, additionally, all 
                                              practitioners may well consider 
                                              seriously the advice (at p 459) 
                                              that our courts should change 
                                              their attitude in considering 
                                              customary law pledges.</span></p>

                                              But, as always, we also have to 
                                              note the faults. In the early part 
                                              of the book there is too much 
                                              Latin sometimes. For instance at p 
                                              58. The fact is that very few 
                                              students are familiar with that 
                                              language now, unfortunately. There 
                                              is a slip at p 54 in the 
                                              discussion of the equitable rule 
                                              number 11: the person meant (in 
                                              line 7) is the creditor, not the 
                                              debtor. Much later, at p 413 (end 
                                              of line 2) it is clear that 
                                              “mortgagee” is meant and not 
                                              &quot;mortgagor&quot; as there now.&nbsp; It 
                                              probably would have helped, at p 
                                              63, to cite section 18 of NRCD 175 
                                              on unconscionability in that 
                                              discussion. &quot;Pearson&quot; at p 81 
                                              (note 62) is not correct. It 
                                              should be “Pierson” (cf) [1948] Ch 
                                              452). And the reference there to 
                                              Hoggart v Scott (note 68) should 
                                              be (1830) and not (1930). Which 
                                              &quot;Lord Buckley&quot; is meant at p 88? 
                                              Perhaps “Lord Justice” was meant. 
                                              And what does this (at p 97) mean: 
                                              “ . . . the English Court of 
                                              Appeal with Lord Denning and Sachs 
                                              LJ concurring?” Then at p 99 note 
                                              132 says “italics supplied”, but 
                                              there is no such supply in the 
                                              section of Act 229 there quoted. 
                                              The last but one sentence of the 
                                              last paragraph of p 106 should 
                                              start with &quot;the lender . . . &quot; and 
                                              not &quot;the borrower&quot; as there now.&nbsp; 
                                              Also, at p 179, there is a 
                                              reference to a Lord Russell LJ in 
                                              Joscelyne v Nissen [1970] 2 QB 86

                                              dropped. And there are many

                                              has over the years been whittled 
                                              away by decisions and its demise

                                              cross-reference to p 78. And at 
                                              the end of the discussion it is 
                                              not clear that the cases have, in

                                              subsequent edition he will give us 
                                              the benefit of careful analyses of

                                              at pp 175-177 there is a review of 
                                              many English cases on 
                                              rectification for unilateral 
                                              mistake. It is then stated that 
                                              the defendant may be given &quot;an 
                                              option for rescission rather than 
                                              rectification in some cases&quot; (p 
                                              175). But there is no indication 
                                              of why that may be done, only a 
                                              suggestion (repeated with emphasis 
                                              at p 177) of how the Ghanaian 
                                              courts should go: which in effect 
                                              is that they should be flexible, 
                                              like the English courts have been. 
                                              Similarly at pp 182-183 it “is 
                                              submitted that the Ghana courts 
                                              should abandon the traditional 
                                              reluctance of the equity courts to 
                                              rectify unconscionable contracts.&quot; 
                                              There is nothing in that section 
                                              to show that our courts have 
                                              tended to follow that tradition; 
                                              and one suspects that the reasons 
                                              for the change there counselled 
                                              may confuse, rather than help, 
                                              many magistrates and young judges. 
                                              It is a pity that the author deals 
                                              with charitable or public trusts 
                                              “only in the barest outline&quot; 
                                              (three and a half pages). Your 
                                              reviewer thinks that in a book 
                                              like this more lead on the subject 
                                              should have been given. Dr Kludze 
                                              alleges at p 342 that the Ghana 
                                              courts would apply a lower 
                                              standard in dealing with breaches 
                                              of trust, but he does not give an 
                                              adequate reason for that view. And 
                                              at p 346, he does not indicate, as 
                                              he ought to, that the Insolvency 
                                              Act, 1962 (Act 153) is not yet in

                                              To come back to lighter matters, 
                                              there are several parts in which 
                                              some explanations are repeated too 
                                              often, even for students. Examples 
                                              are to be found at pp 361 and 364 
                                              where the familiar definitions of 
                                              a mortgage are stated more than 
                                              once in each case. On p 459 one 
                                              may wonder whether our author's 
                                              arguments on prima facie 
                                              presumption of title (from long 
                                              possession) are consistent with 
                                              his earlier statement that &quot;the 
                                              courts seem to have further 
                                              disabled themselves by not 
                                              regarding possession as prima

                                              accept Dr Kludze's submissions on 
                                              the announcement of debts at 
                                              funerals (p 468) or his suggestion 
                                              (at p 471) that the rules of 
                                              evidence should be relaxed to let 
                                              in parol evidence where a pledge 
                                              transaction is reduced into 
                                              writing. Finally, do we still have 
                                              customary law pledges, that is,

                                              Yet none of these things (ie the

                                              suggestions) reduces the pleasure 
                                              one gets in reading this big book. 
                                              Practically all students of law 
                                              should be able to follow the 
                                              language without much effort. Its 
                                              chief merits undoubtedly include 
                                              these: That the issues are 
                                              clarified, the statements are 
                                              full, and in most cases the 
                                              discussions are adequate. Dr 
                                              Kludze has achieved his aim 
                                              admirably; and his book can be 
                                              recommended without reservation.

                                              arranged for such a neat
