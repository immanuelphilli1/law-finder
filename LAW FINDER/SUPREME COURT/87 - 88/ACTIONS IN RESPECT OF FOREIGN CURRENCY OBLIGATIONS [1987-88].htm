                                              IN 1979 a Ghanaian businessman 
                                              entered into a contract in Hungary 
                                              for the supply to him of goods by 
                                              a Hungarian state corporation. The 
                                              goods were delivered to him under 
                                              the contract.&nbsp; He made part 
                                              payment of the purchase price, and 
                                              issued cheques for US$86,250 to 
                                              cover the outstanding balance.&nbsp; 
                                              The cheques were not honoured. In 
                                              August 1982, he agreed in Ghana to 
                                              settle his debt by monthly 
                                              instalments over a period of 
                                              eleven months, but he failed to 
                                              honour this agreement.&nbsp; 
                                              Eventually, in July 1984 court 
                                              proceedings were initiated in 
                                              Ghana on behalf of the corporation 
                                              for recovery of the unpaid sum.&nbsp; 
                                              The defendant admitted liability 
                                              for the debt, and the parties were 
                                              apparently agreed that judgment 
                                              would have to be entered in favour 
                                              of the plaintiffs in cedis, rather 
                                              than in US dollars.</span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
                                              <span style="font-family: Arial">
                                              However, while the plaintiff 
                                              wanted the whole debt to be paid 
                                              immediately, the defendant sought 
                                              to be allowed to pay by 
                                              instalments. It appears that the 
                                              High Court proceeded by entering a 
                                              consent judgment in favour of the 
                                              plaintiff in September 1984 
                                              requiring that the entire debt be 
                                              paid at &quot;the prevailing bank 
                                              rate.&quot;1 Thereafter, on 31 October 
                                              1984, it granted an application by 
                                              the defendant to pay the debt by 
                                              instalments, giving him a 
                                              nine-month period within which to 
                                              pay. At the end of that period, in 
                                              August 1985, the defendant who had 
                                              made only the first of the 
                                              required payments, applied again 
                                              for a stay of execution and 
                                              extension of time within which to 
                                              pay. The legal representatives of 
                                              the parties agreed to a consent 
                                              judgment on 27 August 1985 by 
                                              which the defendant was &quot;to pay 
                                              the balance now outstanding, ie 
                                              ¢4,662,062.50&quot; within two weeks.&nbsp; 
                                              The defendant first paid ¢3 
                                              million of that amount into court 
                                              and then, after the rejection of a 
                                              further application by him, he 
                                              paid in the remaining 
                                              ¢1,662,062.50.</span></p>

                                              Subsequently, however, he applied 
                                              for an amendment of the consent 
                                              judgment of September 1984, 
                                              arguing that the exchange rate 
                                              which should have been applied to 
                                              determine how much he should pay 
                                              in cedis, was the rate at that 
                                              date. The High Court upheld the 
                                              contention of the defendant 
                                              (though Ansah-Twum J would have 
                                              gone further but for the parties' 
                                              earlier agreement embodied in the 
                                              judgment of September 1984) and 
                                              fixed the calculation of the 
                                              exchange rate at an even earlier 
                                              date, namely, that of the

                                              payment, corresponds to the amount

                                              the same point and, apparently 
                                              sceptical of the chances of 
                                              persuading the English courts, 
                                              adds that such a &quot;result could be 
                                              achieved by adding a few simple

                                              By 1971, when the third edition 
                                              was published, Mann had become 
                                              more forceful in his criticism of 
                                              the English authorities. &quot;Such 
                                              results,&quot; says the learned author, 
                                              &quot;are unworthy of a rational legal

                                              Of course, Dr Mann's work has no 
                                              more standing in our legal system 
                                              than is demanded by the force of 
                                              persuasive argument. But that is 
                                              the same as the legal standing of 
                                              decisions of English courts,

                                              In Hungarotex, was the Court of 
                                              Appeal bound, as Osei-Hwere JA 
                                              argued, to perpetuate the 
                                              irrationalities of the earlier 
                                              English decisions? He relied on 
                                              the decision in Societe Generale. 
                                              In that case, the Court of Appeal 
                                              overturned a High Court judgment 
                                              ordering the appellants to pay 
                                              French francs to the respondent.&nbsp; 
                                              The contract of employment between 
                                              the parties required that part of 
                                              the respondent's salary be paid in 
                                              French francs. The appellants were 
                                              held to have violated the contract 
                                              by sacking the respondent.&nbsp; The 
                                              Court of Appeal varied the 
                                              judgment of the High Court, and 
                                              ordered that the appellants pay 
                                              cedis rather than francs.&nbsp; Anin 
                                              JSC refused to follow an earlier 
                                              decision of Akufo-Addo CJ, sitting 
                                              in the High Court, in which he 
                                              awarded damages in foreign 
                                              currency.&nbsp; That decision had been 
                                              reversed, on different grounds, 
                                              and besides, Anin JSC said, &quot;[t]his 
                                              court is not bound by the High 
                                              Court decision.” He then invoked 
                                              rule 177 of the 7th edition of 
                                              Dicey’s Conflict of Laws, and the 
                                              cases cited therein to support the 
                                              assertion that &quot;it is . . . 
                                              procedurally wrong for the 
                                              Ghanaian court to award damages in 
                                              foreign currency.&quot;10</span></p>

                                              In Societe Generale, the issue was 
                                              as to whether or not the Ghanaian 
                                              court could order a party to make 
                                              payment in a foreign currency. The 
                                              question about the date on which 
                                              the exchange rate conversion was 
                                              to be made was not in issue, and 
                                              therefore any utterances by Anin 
                                              JSC on that point would, by the 
                                              rules of precedent, not be binding 
                                              even on a lower court.&nbsp; Besides, 
                                              the action in Societe Generale was 
                                              for damages for breach of 
                                              contract. To the extent that in 
                                              Hungarotex the plaintiffs were 
                                              seeking to recover a debt, rather 
                                              than damages, the actions were 
                                              different, and the decision in one 
                                              case does not settle the question 
                                              in the other. (Of course, there 
                                              would be good reason to apply one 
                                              rule to the two situations, if 
                                              that rule makes sense).</span></p>

                                              English law which are being 
                                              applied on the basis of Order 74.&nbsp; 
                                              Firstly, that the court has 
                                              jurisdiction to entertain an 
                                              action demanding a payment in 
                                              foreign currency and to enter 
                                              judgment in such currency and 
                                              secondly, that if the judgment 
                                              debt is to be converted into the 
                                              money of the forum, the date for 
                                              determining the exchange rate is 
                                              the date of payment.</span></p>

                                              If we look at these two rules

                                              either as procedural.&nbsp; The first 
                                              is a question of jurisdiction, and 
                                              the Court of Appeal has held that 
                                              Order 74 does not authorise a 
                                              Ghanaian court to expand its 
                                              jurisdiction by analogy with an 
                                              English Court.11 The second rule, 
                                              relating to the date of 
                                              conversion, is a matter of the 
                                              substantive discharge of a money 
                                              obligation.12 Admittedly, writers 
                                              on the conflict of laws, including 
                                              Dr Mann, have characterised these 
                                              rules as procedural.13 But that 
                                              characterisation is only 
                                              justifiable, if at all, in a 
                                              special sense, as a shorthand way 
                                              of expressing the point that these 
                                              rules apply to all actions brought 
                                              in England to enforce foreign 
                                              money obligations, regardless of 
                                              the proper law of the obligation. 
                                              That is a limited and somewhat 
                                              arbitrary use of &quot;procedural.&quot;14</span></p>

                                              The general rules as to when and 
                                              how a debt is discharged will have

                                              the word. Cf Cheshire &amp; North, op 
                                              cit., p. 77: &quot;What is procedural, 
                                              what substantive, cannot be 
                                              determined in vacuo. A line 
                                              between the two must, of course, 
                                              be drawn, but in deciding where to 
                                              draw it we ... must realise the 
                                              exact purpose for which we are 
                                              making the distinction.&quot;</span></p>
