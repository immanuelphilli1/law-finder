                                              ON the conclusion of his 
                                              cross-examination a witness may be 
                                              re-examined on behalf of the party 
                                              for whom he has given evidence-in- 
                                              chief, for the purpose of 
                                              explaining any part of his 
                                              evidence given in 
                                              cross-examination which is capable 
                                              of being construed unfavourably to 
                                              his own side. (See section 179 of 
                                              Evidence Decree, 1975 (NRCD 323) 
                                              and Halshury’s Laws of England 
                                              (4th ed), Vol 17, para 280). The 
                                              following limitations however 
                                              exist: (a) It can only cover 
                                              issues raised in cross-examination 
                                              and therefore no questions may be 
                                              asked which introduce wholly new 
                                              matters. For example, (i) in the 
                                              Queen’s Case (1820) 2 Brod &amp; Bing 
                                              284) where a witness 
                                              cross-examined as to whether he 
                                              had not stated that he was to be 
                                              the witness for the prosecution. 
                                              In re-examination the witness can 
                                              only be asked what induced him to 
                                              make the statement, (ii) a 
                                              witness, admitting in 
                                              cross-examination a conversation 
                                              with defendant, may be re-examined 
                                              as to the whole of the 
                                              conversation but not if he denies 
                                              that he had any such conversation 
                                              at all. See Dicas v Lord Brougham 
                                              (1833) 6 C &amp; P 249, (iii) if 
                                              cross-examined as to a particular 
                                              statement only, witness may not be 
                                              re-examined on other statements in 
                                              some conversation unconnected with 
                                              the one spoken to. See Prince v 
                                              Samo (1838) 7 Ad &amp; El 627. A new 
                                              matter can only be introduced in 
                                              re-examination with the leave of 
                                              the court in which case 
                                              cross-examination on the new 
                                              matter will be given. (b) 
                                              Re-examination unlike 
                                              cross-examination must not be 
                                              leading. See Ireland v Taylor 
                                              [1949] 1 KB 300 at 313, CA. (c) It 
                                              cannot be used to elicit evidence 
                                              which should have been dealt with 
                                              in examination-in-chief. It is 
                                              also worthy to note that where 
                                              questions asked in cross 
                                              examination let in evidence which 
                                              would not have been admissible in 
                                              chief, the witness may be 
                                              re-examined upon it. (Blewett v 
                                              Tregonning (1835) 5 Nev &amp; MKB 308; 
                                              Greville v Chapman (1844) 5 QBD 
                                              713). (d) Section 73(2) of the 
                                              Evidence Decree, 1975, states 
                                              further that a witness cannot be 
                                              re-examined or otherwise further 
                                              re-examined as to the same matter 
                                              raised by the examining party on 
                                              previous examination without leave 
                                              granted by the court in its 
                                              discretion.</span></p>

                                              The court has much discretion with 
                                              regard to the conduct of a case. 
                                              Section 69 of the Evidence Decree 
                                              states that the court shall 
                                              exercise reasonable control over 
                                              the mode and order of 
                                              interrogating witnesses and 
                                              presenting evidence. Also section

                                              The fundamental principle or real 
                                              purpose of re-examination is to 
                                              enable a witness to explain or 
                                              expand upon what he said in 
                                              evidence in cross-examination. 
                                              Richard Ducann QC in his book on 
                                              the Art or the Advocate, states: 
                                              “If the witness has been badly 
                                              mauled by the cross-examination 
                                              then the re-examination can 
                                              attempt to put Humpty-Dumpty 
                                              together again.” It is also 
                                              important to keep in mind that 
                                              re-examination only arises where a 
                                              witness has been cross-examined, 
                                              where therefore cross-examination 
                                              is declined then no re-examination 
                                              can take place. Ducann therefore 
                                              advises counsel not to ask any 
                                              questions in cross-examination if 
                                              it is realised that the examining 
                                              advocate has forgotten to ask 
                                              about something or has failed to 
                                              get the answer he wants. If he 
                                              does ask a question then he allows 
                                              his opponent a second bite at the 
                                              cherry. While considering the 
                                              question of re-examination, in the 
                                              process of the trial, i.e. 
                                              examination-in-chief, 
                                              cross-examination to be followed 
                                              by re-examination we should note 
                                              that the re-examination is not 
                                              necessarily the final drama in the 
                                              act.&nbsp; There is the power of the 
                                              judge to question or call 
                                              witnesses. This topic was not 
                                              implicitly included in my address 
                                              nevertheless I believe, to 
                                              complete the circle, I ought to 
                                              touch on it. The judge has a 
                                              discretionary power to ask a 
                                              witness any question which he 
                                              considers necessary. The judge 
                                              must not however take it upon 
                                              himself to conduct the examination 
                                              or cross-examination of a witness.

                                              judge should not call such a

                                              of ammonia with premises in London 
                                              was alleged by one Mr. Bigsby, a

                                              and Japan Black) that Mr. Hollis’ 
                                              factory emitted sulphuretted 
                                              hydrogen which injured the health 
                                              of himself, his family and the 
                                              plants in his garden and he sought 
                                              an injunction to prevent Hollis 
                                              from continuing to poison the 
                                              local atmosphere. No suggestion 
                                              was made to Bigsby in 
                                              cross-examination that he too 
                                              emitted sulphuretted hydrogen from

                                              witness even performed an 
                                              experiment in court to prove his 
                                              point which nearly asphyxiated the 
                                              judge. Mr. Bigsby, who, knowing he

                                              gave no vapur at all and no

                                              an indication of the mode by which 
                                              it is to be proved. This procedure 
                                              of addressing the court at the 
                                              commencement of the case both for 
                                              the plaintiff and the defendant is 
                                              meant to enable the judge and, or, 
                                              judge and jury where there is one, 
                                              to be appraised of the issue and 
                                              have a clear idea of what to 
                                              expect from the witnesses expected 
                                              to establish the facts. 
                                              Unfortunately, this practice is 
                                              not being continued in our courts 
                                              and most cases are begun without 
                                              the judge appreciating what facts 
                                              to expect and some do nothing more 
                                              than merely record what transpires 
                                              in court. The final address is 
                                              meant to summarise the case for 
                                              each side, ie the facts but also 
                                              the law that supports the 
                                              propositions of the issues set 
                                              down for trial. Indeed if judges 
                                              can give guidance the legal issues 
                                              can be narrowed down and the 
                                              addresses can aid the judge in 
                                              giving judgment.</span></p>

                                              In eighteenth century Britain, 
                                              counsel who could appeal to the 
                                              sentiment of the jury had always 
                                              succeeded in swaying them to their 
                                              side Lord Cherstefield in a letter 
                                              to his son in 1746 lead this to 
                                              say:</span></p>

                                              “Wherever you would persuade or 
                                              prevail, address yourself to the 
                                              passions, it is by them that 
                                              mankind is to be taken. I bid you

                                              love, pity, ambition, or whichever 
                                              is their reason can do against 
                                              you.”</span></p>

                                              This practice, of course, may not 
                                              be applicable in present-day 
                                              England nor in Ghana of today. The 
                                              important issue, however, is that 
                                              some cases involve technical 
                                              issues of fact or even at times 
                                              technical legal issues in some 
                                              aspects of law of which the judge 
                                              may not be very conversant and it 
                                              is the responsibility of counsel, 
                                              and I would add that the judge 
                                              ought to encourage counsel to 
                                              research and address the court on 
                                              such issues, then justice can 
                                              truly be seen to be done.</span></p>

                                              At the moment because of shortage 
                                              of materials, ie books dealing 
                                              with the various specialised 
                                              fields of law and the lazy 
                                              latitude of most counsel who are 
                                              in a hurry to make money, the 
                                              judges are not being aided by 
                                              addresses. The practice has also 
                                              recently developed of judges 
                                              requesting counsel to submit 
                                              written addresses. The misfortune 
                                              of the mode, even though it could 
                                              ease the burden of recording the 
                                              address to the judge, does not 
                                              conform to the rule of the order 
                                              of addresses. This is because in 
                                              most instances both addresses are 
                                              submitted at the same time and 
                                              therefore the party who is to have 
                                              the last word, because he is not 
                                              served with the address of his 
                                              opponent cannot reply to it. It is 
                                              also pertinent to mention that an 
                                              advocate as the term goes is one 
                                              who speaks for his client and many 
                                              counsel may be good on their feet 
                                              and not necessarily in putting 
                                              those same thoughts in a written 
                                              form. Perhaps a balance need be 
                                              drawn in this regard.</span></td>
