												&#8211; <b>Caveat -</b>&nbsp; This is an 
												appeal against the unanimous 
												decision of the Court of Appeal 
												which had dismissed the 
												appellants' appeal and upheld 
												the decision of the trial High 
												Court dismissing their claim for 
												grant of letters of 
												administration in respect of 
												their late father's estate. The 
												trial High Court held that the 
												issue as to whether it was the 
												maternal or the paternal family 
												of the appellants' late father 
												that was entitled to administer 
												the estate of their late father, 
												Edward Daniel Lartey, had been 
												decided earlier in 1955 by the 
												High Court, Accra, in favour of 
												the respondent's predecessor 
												called Ben Quao Mensah. As such, 
												the appellants were estopped per 
												rem judicatam by the said 
												earlier decision from 
												relitigating the matter. That 
												this was so, especially, as the 
												appellants never appealed 
												against the said earlier 
												decision to enable an appellate 
												court set it aside. The 1st, 2nd 
												and 3rd plaintiffs/appellants 
												are the children of the late 
												Edward Daniel Lartey whose 
												estate was the subject of the 
												various actions, and the 4th 
												plaintiff/appellant is the 
												grand-niece of the said 
												deceased. The appellants took 
												this action at the High Court, 
												Accra The defendant/respondent, 
												Abban Otoo, is a member of the 
												deceased's maternal family. In 
												an action which immediately 
												preceded the action now before 
												us, the appellants sued the 
												respondent's predecessor, Ben 
												Quao Mensah, in respect of the 
												same estate of their said late 
												father. When the said Ben Quao 
												Mensah died in the course of 
												that litigation, the respondent 
												herein was appointed by the 
												maternal family to apply to be 
												substituted for the said Ben 
												Quao Mensah. This action was, 
												however, later struck out. The 
												appellants then applied for 
												letters of administration to 
												administer their late father's 
												estate. The respondent, 
												obviously on the authority of 
												the maternal family, caveated. 
												This resulted in the present 
												action being taken.- <b>

												- It is the jurisdiction of the 
												High Court to entertain this 
												writ which is at the heart of 
												the application before this 
												Court.&nbsp; The applicant initially 
												made an application to the High 
												Court (Commercial Division), 
												seeking the dismissal of the 
												action on the ground that it was 
												an abuse of the judicial 
												process, since the High Court 
												had already ruled on the 
												matter.&nbsp; Her Ladyship Torkornoo 
												J. dismissed this application, 
												explaining that the High Court 
												becomes <i>functus officio</i> 
												only in relation to matters that 
												it had already dealt with.&nbsp; She 
												was of the view that the entry 
												of judgment filed was a manifest 
												misrepresentation of the 
												agreement reached by the parties 
												and which had been recorded by 
												her sister in her ruling of 20<sup>th</sup> 
												June 2006.&nbsp; Accordingly, she 
												dismissed the application in a 
												ruling dated 28<sup>th</sup> 
												February 2008 Dissatisfied with 
												that outcome, the applicant bank 
												has filed the present 
												application seeking to invoke 
												the supervisory jurisdiction of 
												the Supreme Court over the court 
												below for an order of certiorari 
												to quash the ruling of the 
												learned trial judge dated 28<sup>th</sup> 
												February 2008 and prohibiting 
												her from continuing with 
												proceedings in this suit.&nbsp; The 
												ground on which this application 
												has been brought is that the 
												High Court has no jurisdiction 
												to entertain the interested 
												parties&#8217; fresh action, since to 
												allow the court below to 
												exercise jurisdiction would mean 
												the High Court would effectively 
												be sitting in judgment over the

												Kpakpo Allotey at the High 
												Court, Accra.&nbsp; Before the case

												against the said Joshua Kpakpo 
												Allotey as he had information 
												that he was preparing to leave 
												the jurisdiction.&nbsp; The claim was 
												for refund of an amount of US$8, 
												850.&nbsp; The defendant in that case 
												was arrested with the warrant 
												and was granted bail in the sum 
												of ¢1,500,000.00 with two 
												sureties. Two persons namely: 
												Eugene Darko Amoako and Benjamin 
												Akwei Allotey executed bail 
												bonds as sureties for Joshua 
												Kpakpo AlloteyIt was apparent 
												that even though the name 
												Benjamin Akwei Allotey was 
												cancelled, his signature as one 
												of the two sureties stood.&nbsp; Be 
												that as it may, the case against

												ended with a summary judgment by 
												which the defendant in that suit 
												Joshua Kpakpo Allotey was 
												adjudged to pay an amount of 
												¢2,508,903.28 inclusive of 
												interest and cost. In the

												<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
												The facts in this appeal admit 
												of no controversy whatsoever. 
												The wife of the 
												plaintiff/appellant/appellant, 
												hereinafter referred to as the 
												plaintiff, defaulted in the 
												repayment of loans he took from 
												the 
												defendants/respondents/respondent 
												hereinafter referred to as the 
												defendant. As a result of this 
												default, the defendants 
												instituted action against the 
												wife of the plaintiff and 
												obtained judgment against her.&nbsp; 
												It was in the course of the 
												execution of the judgment that 
												the defendants caused the Deputy 
												Sheriff to attach items which 
												belonged to the plaintiff from 
												their matrimonial home. The 
												items of property seized from 
												the plaintiff were a Mitsubishi 
												car and a deep freezer. 
												Following the failure of the 
												defendants to return the said 
												items to the plaintiff upon 
												repeated demands, the plaintiff 
												instituted an action in the High 
												Court against the defendants. In 
												view of the issues raised in 
												this appeal, which hinged on 
												what constitutes General and 
												Special damages, it is 
												considered worthwhile to produce 
												in detail the entire reliefs 
												that the plaintiff claimed 
												against the defendants.-<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="2012/PETER%20ANKOMAH%20V%20CITY%20INVESTMENT%20COMPANY.htm">

                                                The plaintiff and the defendant 
                                                at the trial court entered into 
                                                a dealership agreement which was 
                                                tendered as exhibit A. The 
                                                purpose of the agreement was to 
                                                enable the plaintiff to run the

                                                The agreement was terminated by 
                                                the defendants at a time when 
                                                the defendants claimed that the 
                                                plaintiff owed it some moneys. &nbsp; 
                                                Following the termination of the 
                                                agreement, the plaintiff sued 
                                                the defendant in the High Court 
                                                for recovery of the GHS

                                                dealership agreement. The High 
                                                Court dismissed all but one of 
                                                the claims: It awarded GHS 
                                                6000.00 as damages for the

                                                agreement and cost of GHS 
                                                1000.00 in favour of the 
                                                plaintiff. &nbsp;The plaintiff 
                                                appealed to the Court of Appeal 
                                                and argued inter alia that the 
                                                damages awarded were on the low 
                                                side. The appeal was dismissed.

												Armed Forces - Court Martial - 
												Good order and discipline</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial">- 
												The complainant in this case was 
												an officer in the Ghana Armed 
												Forces. He was the Provost 
												Marshall. His duties touched on 
												security and discipline within 
												the armed Forces. The appellant 
												on the other hand was a 
												corporal. He had had 19 years 
												military service to his 
												credit.On the night of 19th 
												November, 1996, the appellant 
												was alleged to have done 
												something very strange. The 
												appellant who was then living in 
												barracks in the Burma Camp in 
												Accra had earlier in the day 
												left the barracks to town. He 
												spent much time in town. At the 
												time he was driving back to the 
												barracks at about 11.30 p.m. the 
												Provost Marshall was also 
												driving into the Burma Camp. 
												According to the prosecution the 
												Provost Marshall stopped at the 
												Burma Camp traffic light because 
												the red light was on, meaning 
												all vehicles must stop. But as 
												he waited, a car from behind 
												drove past him, ignoring the red 
												signal. When the green light 
												came on, the Provost Marshall 
												decided to find out the person 
												who drove through the red light. 
												He therefore followed the other 
												car and found it parked near a 
												house. The owner came out and 
												was about to enter his room when 
												the Provost Marshall walked up 
												to him and, recognizing the 
												appellant, the Provost Marshall 
												asked why he drove through the 
												red traffic light. The appellant 
												said the red light was not on. 
												The denial surprised the 
												complainant and he asked for the 
												appellant&#8217;s identity card. 
												According to the prosecution the 
												appellant produced the card; but 
												when he realized that the 
												complainant intended to keep the 
												card and also lodge a complaint 
												against him he decided to 
												collect back his card. During 
												the struggle he was alleged to 
												have hit the complainant in the 
												face with a blow. The 
												complainant fell down and the 
												appellant sat over him and 
												rained blows on him. Some people 
												who were around the scene went 
												to the rescue of the 
												complainant. When freed, the 
												complainant rushed to the 
												military police and reported the 
												incident. Men were sent to 
												arrest the appellant but the 
												appellant was combative and 
												engaged them in a fight. It took 
												a three-man reinforcement to 
												overpower the appellant and 
												confine him to cells. He was 
												later charged with the typically 
												military offences of (1) 
												striking a superior officer, (2) 
												use of violence against a 
												superior officer and (3) conduct 
												prejudicial to good order and 
												discipline. The appellant denied 
												the offences.- <b>

												as a simple banking transaction 
												was challenged on two principal 
												grounds. As averred in the

												the grounds of fraud, with

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The quintessence of the 
												Respondent&#8217;s case against the 
												Appellant is that as a result of 
												its negligence in opening a bank 
												account at its Liberia Road 
												Branch, Accra, with the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Defendant, as well as its 
												further negligence in paying 
												over the &#8220;colossal sum of 
												$82,000&#8221; to the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Defendant, the Respondent has 
												sustained loss of similar 
												magnitude and the Appellant 
												should make good that loss. This 
												submission of negligence was 
												based on section 81 of our Bills 
												of Exchange Act 1961 (Act 55) 
												hereinafter &#8220;BEA&#8221;. The courts 
												below accepted it and gave 
												judgment for the Respondent. The 
												Appellant says the Court of 
												Appeal erred and invites Your 
												Lordships to reverse that Court.<b>
												</b>In the very first paragraph 
												if its judgment the Court of 
												Appeal noted: &#8220;It (the case) 
												dramatizes the horrors of some 
												of the sophisticated banking 
												frauds often heard of in these 
												days. They are mostly 
												technically designed criminal 
												offences capable of detection 
												only through the same lenses of 
												high technology typical of our 
												current computer age. The 
												emphasis here is that modern 
												criminals have left the streets 
												and are using high technology to 
												infiltrate our banking and other 
												financial institutions for their 
												fraudulent operations. It is 
												within this background that the 
												facts of this case must be 
												scrutinized and analysed.&#8221;<b>
												</b>My Lords, this appeal deals 
												with an important aspect of 
												modern banking; ie. 
												international funds transfer. 
												The payment message in this case 
												was communicated by electronic 
												means. A few centuries ago, the 
												world mercantile community 
												invented negotiable instruments 
												to facilitate international 
												trade. The bill of exchange was 
												also developed to obviate the 
												necessity of carrying large sums 
												of money across international 
												frontiers. Laws were ultimately 
												enacted to cover their use and 
												new nomenclature was devised to 
												distinguish various parties to a 
												bill,&nbsp;As a special function of 
												banking, foreign trade was 
												financed by commercial 
												documentary credits (popularly 
												known as &#8220;letters of credit&#8221;).&nbsp;<b><a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="2006A/VICTORIA%20ISLAND%20PROPERTIES%20LTD%20%20&%20ANZ%20GRINDLAYS%20BANK%20LTD%20%20%20v.htm"><span style="text-decoration: none">VICTORIA

												respect of the Passbooks A/C No. 
												3838 and 8541 respectively with 
												bank statements supplied by the

												plaintiffs the reconciliation 
												disclosed that deposits recorded

												total amount deposited in the 
												Passbooks which did not reflect 
												in the bank statement was GH¢50,910.00,

												Building contract &#8211; Agreement &#8211; 
												Sale -</span></b><span lang="CY" style="font-family: Arial"> 
												The Plaintiff&#8217;s story, as set 
												out in his statement of claim, 
												was that he owned a piece of 
												land near Achimota, Accra, and, 
												around 1991, agreed with the 
												Defendant that he should 
												construct a building for the 
												Plaintiff on that piece of 
												land.&nbsp; The agreed price for this 
												service was 17 million cedis.&nbsp; 
												The Plaintiff paid, in 1991, 
												through his father, 14 million 
												cedis out of this agreed price 
												to the Defendant.&nbsp; The Plaintiff 
												claimed that by 1994 the 
												building had been roofed and he 
												put a caretaker into it, pending 
												the final completion of the 
												construction.&nbsp; When at this 
												point the Defendant demanded 
												payment of 3 million cedis, 
												being the balance of the agreed 
												contract price, the Plaintiff 
												rejected the demand, arguing 
												that by the terms of the 
												agreement the balance was to be 
												paid when the building had been 
												completed and the keys handed 
												over to him.&nbsp; The Defendant then 
												threatened to sell the building, 
												started showing prospective 
												purchasers around the property 
												and harassed the Plaintiff&#8217;s 
												caretaker.The Defendant&#8217;s 
												version of events was 
												different.&nbsp; He averred that the 
												land near Achimota belonged to 
												him and that he was developing 
												it into a dwelling house when 
												the Plaintiff requested to buy 
												it through his father.&nbsp; He 
												averred further that the 
												building was completed in 1994, 
												but the Plaintiff failed to pay 
												the balance of the contract 
												price, namely the 3 million 
												cedis referred to above, in 
												spite of repeated demands.&nbsp; 
												Therefore, after waiting for a 
												long period without receiving 
												payment, he agreed with the 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s father, who acted as 
												agent for the Plaintiff in the 
												transaction, to rescind the 
												contract and refund the 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s money to him.&nbsp; In 
												accordance with this agreement, 
												he refunded 4 million cedis by 
												cheque to the father on 12th 
												September 1994.&nbsp; The Defendant 
												had subsequently offered to 
												refund the balance of 10 million 
												cedis to the Plaintiff&#8217;s 
												father.&nbsp; Although, he was 
												willing to accept the refund, he 
												had been prevailed upon by the 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s mother, who was the 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s lawful attorney in 
												this suit, to refuse the refund

												<b>transfer -</b> The facts in 
												this case are undisputed and 
												relatively simple.&nbsp; The 
												Interested Party in this case 
												applied to the High Court to 
												dismiss an action that had been 
												brought by the applicant and 
												other plaintiffs in this case.&nbsp; 
												Its reason for bringing that 
												application was that because of 
												the opinion expressed by the 
												Supreme Court on 23<sup>rd</sup> 
												July 2008 on certain 
												constitutional issues referred 
												to it by the High Court in this 
												case, no cause of action 
												survived that the applicant 
												could legitimately pursue.&nbsp; 
												Although the reference had been 
												made by His Lordship Justice 
												Abada, the Interested Party&#8217;s 
												application was placed before 
												His Lordship Justice Edward 
												Amoako Asante, by an order of 
												transfer made by the Chief 
												Justice.&nbsp; Justice Asante ruled 
												on 20<sup>th</sup> August 2008 
												upholding the Interested Party&#8217;s 
												application and characterising 
												the applicant&#8217;s suit in the 
												court below as &#8221;unmeritorious 
												and an abuse of the judicial 
												process to unlawfully challenge 
												a legally sanctioned act.&#8221;&nbsp; 
												Aggrieved by this outcome, the 
												applicant filed an appeal and 
												filed an application for an 
												interim injunction on 21st 
												August 2008, which was fixed for 
												hearing on 3<sup>rd</sup> 
												September 2008.&nbsp; On 3<sup>rd</sup> 
												September 2008 the case was 
												called before Asante J, who 
												adjourned it to 22<sup>nd</sup> 
												October 2008 for hearing.&nbsp; 
												However, on the 22<sup>nd</sup> 
												October, when the applicant and 
												the other plaintiffs in the suit 
												appeared in the High Court, Fast 
												Track 1, Justice Asante was not 
												available and so his clerk 
												adjourned the case to 6<sup>th</sup> 
												November 2008.&nbsp; On the same day, 
												however, the case was also 
												called in the High Court, Fast 
												Track 2, presided over by 
												Justice Ofori-Atta.&nbsp; He heard 
												submissions by counsel for the 
												Interested Party, in the absence 
												of the applicant and its 
												counsel, and fixed 4<sup>th</sup> 
												November 2008 for his ruling.On 
												4<sup>th</sup> November, the 
												applicant and its counsel 
												appeared before Ofori-Atta J and 
												raised an objection to his 
												delivering a ruling in the case 
												on the ground that the case had 
												not been transferred to him by 
												the Chief Justice.&nbsp; Justice 
												Ofori-Atta nevertheless 
												proceeded to give his ruling, 
												dismissing the application for 
												interim injunction.&nbsp; The 
												applicant contends that this 
												ruling and the hearing of the 
												application on 22<sup>nd</sup> 
												October should be quashed by 
												this Court as having been made 
												without jurisdiction by 
												Ofori-Atta J, since there was no 
												order of the Chief Justice 
												transferring the case from 
												Justice Asante to Justice Ofori-

												In the course of the trial, the

												Other major setbacks suffered 
												include; a four- time change of 
												solicitors, several adjournments 
												before the two different judges

												have trespassed on<b> </b>On the 
												1<sup>st</sup> of November,

												initiated contempt proceedings

												the contempt application was 
												placed before Mrs Justice Owusu

												continued to be managed by her

												- <b>Kingmakers -</b> he facts 
												of the case are as follows: At 
												the election meeting, the Second 
												Respondent invited all 
												contestants to the vacant Wa 
												skin to identify themselves, 
												whereupon the Petitioner and the 
												First Respondent/Appellant/ 
												Appellant, subsequently referred 
												to in this judgment as the First 
												Respondent, identified 
												themselves. The Petitioner and 
												the First Respondent both made a 
												presentation to the meeting of 
												their &quot;manifesto&quot;, setting out 
												the reasons why they should be 
												elected to the vacant skin of Wa. 
												In his presentation, the 
												Petitioner averred that he had 
												reminded the meeting that in 
												1951 during the reign of Wa Na 
												Mumuni Koray of Jonyuobi, the 
												Wala Traditional Council had 
												decided and resolved that there 
												were four gates to the Wa 
												Paramountcy and that since that 
												declaration by the Traditional 
												Council in 1951 only the Nakpaha 
												gate had not had its turn in 
												providing a chief for Wa. He 
												contended therefore that, in 
												fairness, it was now the turn of 
												the Nakpaha gate to present a 
												candidate to the vacant Wa skin. 
												After the presentations by the 
												candidates, the Kingmakers 
												retired into an inner room. At 
												this point, the Froko, Alhaji 
												Iddrisu, delegated his brother (Hamaru 
												Froko) to act for him in the 
												proceedings in the inner 
												room.The central controversy in 
												this case revolves round what 
												took place in the inner room. 
												The Petitioner averred that in 
												the inner room he was elected by 
												the Tendaana and this was 
												concurred in by the Yeri Na and 
												Froko. He further averred that 
												the Tendaana made it plain that 
												his election of the Petitioner 
												was based on the fact that it 
												was now the turn of Nakpaha 
												gate's nominee to be elected Wa 
												Na in the interest of fairness. 
												The Petitioner's contention was 
												that, since he was the nominee 
												of Nakpaha Gate and had their 
												vote, in addition to the three 
												other Kingmakers already 
												referred to, he had the majority 
												support of the Kingmakers. The 
												Petitioner claimed that he 
												emerged from the inner room to 
												where the observers of the 
												election were seated and clapped 
												his hands and started 
												jubilating. The Tendaana also 
												came out and made the 
												declaration that the Petitioner 
												had been chosen as Wa Na.Next, 
												according to the Petitioner, to 
												his utter shock and disbelief, 
												the Second Respondent announced 
												to the observers that five of 
												the Kingmakers had elected the 
												Busa Na, who had, in turn, 
												transferred his election to the 
												First Respondent and that the 
												Second Respondent had further 
												announced that two of the 
												Kingmakers were not sure of 
												which candidate to choose. The 
												Petitioner contended that the 
												Busa Na was not a candidate for 
												the Wa skin and thereforehis 
												purported election was null and 
												void.- <b>

												by the Brong-Ahafo Regional 
												House of Chiefs in Chieftaincy 
												proceedings before it as appears 
												at page 26 lines 18-24 of the 
												Record of Appeal, as follows:

												Kwasi Wuromo the Krontihene of 
												Banda, the 4th petitioner Nana 
												Sodoyi the Oyokohene of Banda

												Akyeamehene to convey the black 
												stool to the Petelli Royal 
												House, Kabrena not later than 
												15/11/88.&#8221; (emphasis supplied) 
												The Appellant belongs to the 
												Kralongo Royal House of Banda 
												from which the Black Stool was 
												to be returned to the other 
												royal House of Banda, namely, 
												the Petelli Royal House. An 
												Appeal from the judgment and 
												said order the of Brong-Ahafo 
												Regional House of Chiefs was 
												dismissed on the 29th day of 
												March, 1991 by the National 
												House of Chiefs.&nbsp; A further 
												appeal to this court was 
												dismissed on the 6th day of 
												June, 1995.The application for 
												attachment for contempt against 
												the appellant was filed in the 
												High Court, Sunyani on the 26th 
												day of January, 1999. It is 
												alleged that the appellant 
												indulged in acts contemptuous of 
												the order as from 23rd day of 
												December, 1997; and the Court of 
												Appeal so found and held.&nbsp; It is 
												however, admitted that the Banda 
												Stool was returned to the 
												respondent&#8217;s family on the 15th 
												day of September, 1998. Several 
												arguments had been addressed to 
												us as to whether the application 
												for contempt against the 
												appellant was or was not a cause 
												or matter affecting 
												Chieftaincy.&nbsp; However, on 
												perusal of the record of appeal 
												we felt that the matter was not 
												a cause or matter affecting 
												chieftaincy but that if the 
												order of the Brong-Ahafo 
												Regional House of Chiefs had 
												lapsed before the alleged acts 
												of contempt by the appellant 
												then the question of contempt 
												could not arise. <b>

												application were that the 
												occupant of the Adonten Stool of 
												the Twifo Hyeman Traditional 
												Area died: Succession to that 
												stool was the prerogative of the 
												Aberadze family of that 
												Traditional Area. It was alleged 
												that the Obaapaanin and head of 
												that family were acting on the 
												instructions of the paramount 
												chief of Twifo Hemang 
												Traditional Area, the first 
												respondent herein, to impose on 
												the stool as a Adontenhene one 
												Mensah Marfo who did not hail 
												from the right lineage of the 
												Adonten Stool.&nbsp; The litigation 
												started by the Stool elders 
												filing a petition in the Central 
												Regional House of Chiefs for a 
												declaration to prevent the 
												installation of Mensah Marfo as 
												Adontenhene. The appellants in 
												the instant appeal then filed an 
												application in the Cape Coast 
												High Court to restrain the 
												Regional House from hearing the 
												petition on the grounds of want

												the application was this; the

												try disputes involving the 
												Asantehene and paramount chiefs 
												as stated in the Chieftaincy 
												Act, 1971(Act 370), s. 23(1) On

												- Later in 1928, the Chief of 
												Duakwa, Nana Amuakwa I, offered 
												the land to Nana Kofi Antwi I 
												for sale. Nana Kofi Antwi I 
												accepted the offer, and the land 
												was sold to him for #465.10. 
												When the money was paid a 
												receipt was issued to 
												acknowledge payment. This was 
												tendered at the trial as Exhibit 
												A. The plaintiff tendered 
												Exhibit B dated 1930 prepared to 
												evidence the sale, to prove his 
												assertion of the sale of the 
												land to his predecessor in 
												title. The plaintiff traced the 
												sequence of succession that when 
												Nana Kofi Antwi I died in 1930; 
												he was succeeded by Nana Kofi 
												Antwi II, till it got to the 
												turn of Nana Kofi Antwi V, the 
												present plaintiff at the 
												trial.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It was in 1976 when 
												Nana Kofi Antwi II died that a 
												faction of the Ayensuako elders 
												enstooled one Kwaku Arhin, a 
												grand-child of Osimpo, as the 
												chief of Ayensuako. Ofinam&#8217;s 
												successors brought an action at 
												the Awutu Traditional Council 
												seeking an order to destool 
												Kwaku Arhin. Kwaku Arhin himself 
												conceded that he was not a chief 
												of Ayensuako and therefore 
												withdrew his claim. Accordingly 
												Nai Awulabi was enstooled as 
												Nana Kofi Antwi IV and 
												controlled the lands of Ofinam 
												until he died in 1997. In 2000, 
												the plaintiff was enstooled as 
												Nana Kofi Antwi V and one 
												Akyeampong slaughtered a sheep 
												to claim the land in dispute, 
												for it had been jointly 
												purchased by Ofinam and Osimpo 
												and he had come to claim the 
												portion that went to Osimpo his 
												ancestor. His action was opposed 
												by the plaintiff who reported 
												the matter to the Police. It was 
												after these events that it came 
												to light that the second 
												defendant had felled fifty palm 
												trees on the land; it was 
												further revealed it was the 
												first defendant who authorized 
												him to do that. The result was 
												the institution of the suit that 
												has traveled the whole distance 
												to this court. <b>

												On the 12<sup>th</sup> January

												Koforidua, granted an order of
												<i>mandamus</i> against the 
												Registrar of the Eastern Region

												he had not been given notice of 
												the application and that it had 
												not been brought in good faith.&nbsp; 
												The Applicant contended that the

												applicant for mandamus was aware 
												that there was a chieftaincy 
												petition pending which sought to 
												nullify the purported 
												enstoolment of the applicant for

												Interested Party in the current

												was not a bar to the forwarding 
												of his Chieftaincy Declaration 
												Forms to the National House of

												This is an appeal from the 
												decision of the National House 
												of Chiefs. On 3rd February, 
												1989, the 
												Petitioners/Respondents herein 
												(some of whom are admitted to be 
												kingmakers of the Owusu-Asare 
												Paramount Stool of Atebubu) 
												petitioned the Brong-Ahafo 
												Regional House of Chiefs for the 
												removal of the 
												Respondent/Appellant herein as 
												the Omanhene (Paramount Chief) 
												of the Atebubu Traditional Area. 
												They sought &#8212; . A declaration 
												that the Respondent herein as 
												occupant of Owusu-Asare Stool '(Atebubu 
												Paramount Stool) has violated 
												customs and taboos of Atebubu' 
												which violations render him 
												liable to be destooled in 
												accordance with Atebubu 
												Customary Law and Usage.&nbsp; An 
												order of destoolment of the 
												Respondent herein Nana Owusu 
												Akyeaw Brempong II as Omanhene 
												of Atebubu&quot;. In all, twelve (12) 
												charges were preferred against 
												the Respondent. On these 
												charges, the Petitioners led 
												evidence and called witnesses in 
												support. They concluded that the 
												Respondent, &quot;does not heed the 
												advice of the kingmakers. He 
												does what pleases him. He has 
												not been observing our custom. 
												The Respondent's behaviour has 
												led to quarrels and tribulations 
												throughout the Atebubu 
												Traditional Area&quot; and must 
												therefore be removed. The 
												Judicial Committee of the 
												Brong-Ahafo Regional House of 
												Chiefs found the 
												Respondent/Appellant herein 
												guilty on two of the charges and 
												ordered his destoolment. The 
												Respondent appealed to the 
												National House of Chiefs which 
												dismissed his appeal and 
												affirmed the decision of the 
												lower tribunal. It is against 
												this decision that this appeal 
												has been brought.- <b>

												which the contempt application 
												was taken out by the respondent 
												in the High Court are these.&nbsp; 
												Following the death of Nana 
												Kwaku Affum, the Akwamuhene of 
												Agogo Traditional Area, the 
												stool became vacant and 
												therefore it became necessary 
												for the kingmakers to find a 
												successor. In his capacity as 
												the head of family, the 
												respondent herein nominated one 
												Nana Adu Asabre whiles the 
												second appellant nominated the 
												first appellant herein. At a 
												meeting held subsequently to 
												elect the successor to the stool 
												from the two nominees, the 
												kingmakers agreed to determine 
												their choice by the casting of 
												votes. Out of the sixteen votes 
												cast, the majority opted for 
												Nana Adu Asabre, the nominee of 
												the respondent while the other 
												contestant, the first appellant 
												herein had five votes. The 
												victorious party thereafter 
												performed the requisite 
												customary rites by providing two 
												bottles of schnapps and five 
												hundred cedis, which was shared 
												among the elders with the first 
												and second appellants herein, 
												however, refusing to accept 
												their share. It appears that 
												from this moment, the Asakyiri 
												royal family was not at peace as 
												subsequent events would attest 
												to. In order to bring the family 
												together, the respondent as head 
												asked the queen mother of 
												Asakyiri family of Adansi 
												Akrokeri to intervene in the 
												matter but she referred the 
												matter to the chief of Morso, 
												the third appellant 
												herein.Instead of resolving the 
												impasse, the third appellant 
												asked the queen mother to 
												nominate one of the two 
												contesting parties to occupy the 
												stool. This she did by 
												nominating the first appellant. 
												Naturally, the other side felt 
												aggrieved and&nbsp; resorted to legal 
												action by taking out an action 
												before the Judicial Committee of 
												the&nbsp; Agogo Traditional Council -

												The facts which gave rise to 
												this litigation were as 
												follows:&nbsp; Nana Abrefa Mbore 
												Bediatuo VII was the paramount 
												chief of Wenchi Traditional 
												area.&nbsp; He died on July 7, 2004. 
												After his death, a former chief 
												of Wenchi, Nana Kusi Appea, 
												filed a petition at the Brong 
												Ahafo Regional House of Chiefs. 
												The petition was against the 
												Wenchi Queen mother and the 
												Wenchi Traditional Council. The 
												petition was mainly for a 
												declaration that he was the 
												sitting chief of Wenchi 
												Traditional Area. The petition 
												was filed in April 2005. It was 
												finally determined in favour of 
												the queen mother and the 
												Traditional Council on the 6<sup>th</sup> 
												of June 2006. A series of 
												meetings followed the 
												determination of the case on 
												that day. The most relevant of 
												the decisions taken at the 
												meetings was that the king 
												makers requested the queen 
												mother to nominate a person to 
												be considered as a chief for the 
												Wenchi Traditional Area to 
												replace the deceased chief. The 
												queen mother replied that she 
												needed three weeks to make the 
												nomination, They premised their 
												demand on the facts that already 
												two royals had expressed 
												interest, They therefore 
												insisted that they could not 
												wait for as long as three weeks 
												demanded by the queen mother for 
												a chief to be nominated. The 
												queen mother on the other hand 
												maintained that there were 
												consultations to be made and 
												other contestants had to be 
												given the chance to put forward 
												their interests and therefore 
												she could not be hustled into 
												making &nbsp;the nomination as 
												immediately as the king makers 
												demanded. - </span><b>

												Eastern Region, settled in the 
												Koforidua area and created New 
												Juaben. The land acquired by 
												Nana Asafo Agyei, the Omanhene 
												who led his people to New Juaben, 
												included Suhyen, where&nbsp;&nbsp; some of 
												his subjects had settled. In or 
												around 1915, a successor 
												Omanhene of New Juaben, Nana 
												Kwaku Boateng I, while on a tour 
												of Suhyen, appointed an Odikro 
												for the town, purportedly 
												because of its strategic 
												importance as the boundary 
												between the Stool lands of New 
												Juaben and Akyem. This first 
												Odikro, Nana Kwaku Amofa Diatuo, 
												belonged to the Asona Clan. He 
												was succeeded by his maternal 
												brother, Nana Ankam, who, with 
												the permission of the New Juaben 
												Omanhene, blackened the Stool of 
												his predecessor. Thus a black 
												Stool for the ruling family of 
												Suhyen came into being. The 
												position of Odikro continued to 
												be held by the Asona family of 
												Nana Diatuo, until after the 
												reign of Nana Obiri Nyebi, when 
												members of other clans including 
												the Ekuona, Aduana and Agona, 
												began to sit on the Stool.&nbsp; Thus 
												Nana Frimpong Manso I, an Ekuona, 
												occupied the Stool in 1954. The 
												Respondents insist that anytime 
												someone outside the Asona Clan 
												sat on the Stool, he did so with 
												the prior consent or approval of 
												the Asona ruling family. During 
												the reign of Frimpong Manso I, 
												the Omanhene of New Juaben Nana 
												Akrasi elevated the Suhyen 
												Odikro Stool into an Mponua or 
												Divisional Stool. The occupant 
												of the new elevated Stool then 
												created the queen mother Stool, 
												whose first occupant was also an 
												Ekuona. Nana Frimpong Manso I 
												was followed by Frimpong Manso 
												II, also an Ekuona. The dispute 
												that has found its way to this 
												Court arose after the latter was 
												destooled and the Elders 
												embarked on a search for a 
												successor - <b>

												The Osu Stool, the appellant 
												herein purportedly acting 
												through its lawful attorney, Nii 
												Ako Nortei II, the Mankralo of 
												Osu brought an action in the 
												High Court Accra in respect of 
												some Lands in Accra.&nbsp; However, 
												Nii Nortey Owuo III intervened 
												in the said suit by motion 
												praying to be substituted as the 
												sole person who can represent 
												the Osu Stool in that litigation 
												on the ground that he is the Osu 
												Mantse.&nbsp; The High Court 
												dismissed his application.&nbsp; When 
												his application for Review 
												failed he successfully appealed 
												to the Court of Appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
												Mankralo has appealed to this 
												court.
												The Mankralo&#8217;s counsel submits 
												that the 
												applicant/respondent/respondent&#8217;s 
												application for substitution, in 
												his stead, as the sole and 
												proper person to represent the 
												Osu Stool in the aforementioned 
												suit in the High Court was 
												fought on affidavit evidence, 
												which showed that the 
												intervener&#8217;s claim to be the Osu 
												Mantse (Chief of Osu) was 
												challenged by him.&nbsp; In the 
												circumstances, so the argument 
												goes, this was a cause or matter 
												affecting chieftaincy over which 
												the High Court has no 
												jurisdiction to determine On the 
												facts of this case no real or 
												genuine question arose 
												concerning chieftaincy.&nbsp; The 
												intervener attached to his 
												motion, exhibit NNOI from the 
												National Register of Chiefs 
												evidencing his status as the Osu 
												Mantse. The appellant sought to 
												nullify the effect of exhibit 
												NNOI by resort to exhibit JKI 
												and a publication in the Local 
												Government Bulletin No.158 dated 
												15<sup>th</sup> August 1986.&nbsp; 
												Exhibit JKI is a letter from the 
												Greater Accra Regional 
												Administrative Officer, dated 5<sup>th</sup> 
												August 1986 stating inter alia 
												that in accordance with 
												&#8220;Government directive as 
												announced on Friday 1<sup>st</sup> 
												August, 1986 regarding the above 
												subject,&#8221;&nbsp; government had 
												withdrawn recognition from the 
												intervener as Osu Mantse and 
												that all processes leading to 
												the acquisition of his status as 
												a chief had been utterly 
												nullified.&nbsp; In the court of 
												Appeal the appellant&#8217;s counsel 
												fastened on this and with 
												ingenuity contended that as this 
												was an act of the PNDC 
												government the same is rendered 
												inviolable by the transitional

												The plaintiff, who is a lawyer 
												and former Paramount Chief and 
												member of the National House of 
												Chiefs, brings this action in 
												his capacity as a citizen of 
												Ghana.&nbsp; The plaintiff issued his 
												Writ of Summons to invoke the

												2008.&nbsp; As mentioned above, this 
												Writ was amended on 11<sup>th</sup> 
												May 2010, after leave had been 
												granted by this Court to do so. 
												The provisions of the 
												Chieftaincy Act, 2008 challenged 
												by the plaintiff are all 
												contained in section 63, which 
												reads as follows:&#8220;Certain 
												offences in connection with 
												chiefs A person who acts or 
												performs the functions of a 
												chief when that person is not 
												qualified to act, being a chief 
												assumes a position that the 
												person is not entitled to by

												word or conduct, deliberately 
												refuses to honour a call from a 
												chief to attend to an issue, 
												refuses to undertake communal 
												labour announced by a chief 
												without reasonable cause, or 
												deliberately fails to follow the 
												right procedures to destool a

												liable on summary conviction to 
												a fine of not more than two

												than three months or to both and 
												in the case of a continuing 
												offence to a further fine of not 
												more than twenty-five penalty 
												units for each day on which the 
												offence continues.&#8221;The plaintiff 
												argues in his Statement of Case 
												that because s. 63(d) of Act 759 
												compels a citizen to honour a 
												call by a chief to attend to an 
												issue, whether he likes it or 
												not, it is unconstitutional as 
												an undue restriction on, and 
												interference with, his freedom 
												of movement.- <b>

												King makers -</b> The facts 
												which gave rise to this 
												litigation were as follows:&nbsp; 
												Nana Abrefa Mbore Bediatuo VII 
												was the paramount chief of 
												Wenchi Traditional area.&nbsp; He 
												died on July 7, 2004. After his 
												death, a former chief of Wenchi, 
												Nana Kusi Appea, filed a 
												petition at the Brong Ahafo 
												Regional House of Chiefs. The 
												petition was against the Wenchi 
												Queen mother and the Wenchi 
												Traditional Council. The 
												petition was mainly for a 
												declaration that he was the 
												sitting chief of Wenchi 
												Traditional Area. The petition 
												was filed in April 2005. It was 
												finally determined in favour of 
												the queen mother and the 
												Traditional Council on the 6<sup>th</sup> 
												of June 2006. A series of 
												meetings followed the 
												determination of the case on 
												that day. The most relevant of 
												the decisions taken at the 
												meetings was that the king 
												makers requested the queen 
												mother to nominate a person to 
												be considered as a chief for the 
												Wenchi Traditional Area to 
												replace the deceased chief. The 
												queen mother replied that she 
												needed three weeks to make the 
												nomination. The king makers who 
												made the request to the queen 
												mother were of the opinion that 
												since the death of the last 
												chief, the stool of Wenchi had 
												been vacant for some time and 
												needed to be occupied. They 
												premised their demand on the 
												facts that already two royals 
												had expressed interest in the 
												position of the chief and had 
												made the necessary approaches to 
												the queen mother to that effect. 
												Further, the process of 
												replacing the chief had started 
												soon after the former chief died 
												in 2004. It was not new to the 
												contestants, the queen mother 
												and the king makers. They 
												therefore insisted that they 
												could not wait for as long as 
												three weeks demanded by the 
												queen mother for a chief to be 
												nominated. The queen mother on 
												the other hand maintained that 
												there were consultations to be 
												made and other contestants had 
												to be given the chance to put 
												forward their interests and 
												therefore she could not be 
												hustled into making&nbsp; the 
												nomination as immediately as the 
												king makers demanded<b>.- </b>

												- This case started when two 
												contestants were vying to be 
												installed as the queenmother of 
												Asante Mampong. One will be 
												described as the nominee of the 
												first appellant. The other 
												contestant was Nana Yaa Adwubi, 
												the third respondent. The case 
												of the appellants was that first 
												appellant&#8217;s nominee intimated to 
												the Mamponghene, the first 
												respondent, that she was 
												interested in being considered 
												for installation as the 
												queenmother of Asante Mampong. 
												When the nominee&#8217;s supporters 
												realized that the first 
												respondent was bent on 
												nominating the third respondent 
												in preference to her, they filed 
												a petition in the Ashanti 
												Regional House of Chiefs The 
												petition was filed on 22 
												February, 2000. On the next day 
												of 23 February, a motion for 
												injunction was filed to restrain 
												the first and second respondents 
												from installing the third 
												respondent as the queenmother of 
												Mampong. The appellants 
												contended further that 
												notwithstanding the motion, the 
												first and second respondents 
												went ahead and installed the 
												third respondent as the 
												queenmother of Asante Mampong on 
												29 February 2000. On 5<sup>
												</sup>April 2000, they filed a 
												motion in the High Court to 
												attach the three respondents for 
												contempt of the Ashanti Regional 
												House of Chiefs. According to 
												the appellants, the basis of the 
												allegation of contempt was that 
												on 7<sup>th</sup> February 2000 
												there was a meeting of the 
												Mamponghene and the Mampong 
												Traditional Council at which the 
												issue of nomination of the 
												queenmother was discussed: The 
												actual enstoolment was conducted 
												on 29 February 2000 while the 
												petition and motion for 
												injunction were already pending. 
												The enstoolment therefore 
												constituted contempt of the 
												Ashanti Regional House of Chiefs 
												that made the injunction order. 
												The respondents on the other 
												hand contended that on 7<sup>th</sup> 
												February 2000 the nomination and 
												installation took place before 
												the appellants filed their 
												petition and obtained the order 
												of injunction. <b>

												Stevedoring Company Ltd (herein 
												after referred to as the 
												Company). They invited Mrs. 
												Brenya to attend a company 
												meeting but she designated her 
												husband, Mr. Brenya to attend 
												instead. At that meeting, Mr. 
												Brenya was appointed company 
												secretary. The four Founders 
												were appointed the company's 
												Directors/Shareholders. He 
												averred further that he paid 
												¢15,000 for the company's 
												licence. The registration of the 
												company was entrusted to Mr. 
												Brenya. It was averred that Mr. 
												Brenya failed to carry out these 
												instructions and rather 
												fraudulently registered the 
												company without the inclusion of 
												Mr. Dolphyne's name as 
												shareholder. Besides he 
												fraudulently put down the names 
												of only himself and his wife as 
												the directors of the company. He 
												Dolphyne, was appointed to 
												oversee the company's operation 
												in Takoradi. It turned out that 
												when he discovered the fraud 
												committed by Mr. Brenya, two of 
												the company's founders namely 
												Messrs Oduro and Arthur made a 
												report to the Registrar General 
												who set up the one man Ntrakwah 
												committee. This committee 
												confirmed Mr. Brenya's fraud. 
												Hence the Circuit Court writ and 
												the reliefs sought. The Circuit 
												Court gave him judgement. There 
												was an appeal to the Court of 
												Appeal, and finally to the 
												Supreme Court, which on 29th 
												January 1997 set aside the 
												reliefs for a director and 
												membership of the company on 
												grounds that a Circuit Court had 
												no jurisdiction to deal in 
												company matters. The Supreme 
												Court however confirmed the 
												damages of ¢3,000,000.00 for 
												fraud. <b>-

												In this judgement the 
												Plaintiff/Appellant/Respondent 
												herein will be referred to as 
												&#8216;the Respondent&#8217;, and the 
												Defendants/Respondents/Appellants 
												will be referred to as &#8216;the 
												Appellants&#8217;. The 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Appellant will also be referred 
												to as &#8216;the Company&#8217;. The brief 
												facts underlying this appeal are 
												that the Company was 
												incorporated sometime in April 
												1991 as a limited liability 
												company with 1,000,000 shares of 
												no par value. Exhibit 1, the 
												Regulations of the Company, 
												shows that the subscribers to 
												the Company were the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Appellant, who subscribed to 
												600,000 shares for which the 
												consideration payable in cash 
												was ¢600,000.00, and Nana Osei 
												Afriyie and the Respondent, each 
												of whom subscribed to 200,000 
												shares for which the 
												consideration payable in cash, 
												in each case, was ¢200,000.00. 
												According to Exhibit 1, the 
												first Directors of the Company 
												were the three subscribers and 
												one D. Patrick Ewusi Sekyi. 
												Sometime after the Company 
												commenced its operations, 
												problems developed between the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Appellant and the Respondent the 
												nub of which was that, whilst 
												the Respondent claimed that he 
												was a fully paid-up member of 
												the Company and entitled to 
												participate in the day to day 
												running of the Company, the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Appellant insisted that the 
												Respondent had not paid for any 
												of his shares. Matters came to a 
												head when, by a letter dated 1<sup>st</sup> 
												November, 1995 (Exhibit Q), the 
												solicitors for the Company 
												informed the Respondent that he 
												(the Respondent) was only a 
												&#8216;nominal shareholder&#8217; of the 
												Company. The letter also 
												purported to offer to the 
												Respondent 20% shares in the 
												Company, in consideration of 
												which he must pay an unspecified 
												sum of money that he was to 
												ascertain by contacting the 
												office of the Managing Director 
												within 14 days, failing which 
												the shares would be offered to 
												someone else. This letter was 
												immediately followed by another 
												communication from the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Appellant, dated 3<sup>rd</sup> 
												November 1995 (Exhibit R), 
												referring to the solicitors&#8217; 
												letter and informing the 
												Respondent that, according to 
												the Company&#8217;s auditor&#8217;s report, 
												the net value of the Company&#8217;s 
												assets was ¢237,051,291.00. The 
												letter also informed the 
												Respondent that, &#8216;as a nominal 
												shareholder&#8217;, he had not paid 
												for his shares and, in order to 
												become a fully-fledged 
												shareholder, he must pay an 
												amount of ¢47,410,258.20, being 
												20% of the current net value of 
												the company&#8217;s assets. The 
												Respondent referred the matter 
												to his solicitors. The record 
												shows further, per Exhibit 3, 
												that on 31<sup>st</sup> October 
												1995, the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Appellant filed at the Companies 
												Registry a form of Notification 
												of Change of Directors which 
												notified the Registrar of 
												Companies of the appointment of 
												5 new Directors. No 
												shareholders&#8217; resolution was 
												exhibited and there is no other 
												evidence that these appointments 
												were made by the shareholders in 
												general meeting, as required by 
												sections 181 and 272 of the Code 
												and regulation 59 of the 
												Company&#8217;s Regulations. - <b>

												establishing a viable and 
												profitable oxygen-manufacturing 
												plant in Ghana.&nbsp; The first 
												plaintiff and the two other

												reached with the second 
												defendant, that forty percent of

												The second defendant admitted in 
												his pleadings that he was the 
												Managing-Director, Governor and 
												Financial Controller of the 
												first defendant.&nbsp; The defendants 
												had, however, failed to honour 
												the agreement concluded with the 
												plaintiffs. &#8220;It is my opinion 
												therefore that there was a valid 
												agreement between the plaintiffs 
												and the defendants whereby the 
												plaintiffs rendered services and 
												provided monies towards the 
												setting up of the oxygen 
												manufacturing plant in 
												expectation of allocation to 
												them of forty per cent shares in 
												the first defendant company.&nbsp;

                                                seeking a declaration that the 
                                                appellant was an educational 
                                                institution of a public 
                                                character and thus its income 
                                                was exempt from tax.&nbsp; It also 
                                                sought an order for the 
                                                annulment of the tax assessments 
                                                for the years 1994 to 2004.&nbsp; 
                                                Even though the High Court found 
                                                that the appellant school was an 
                                                educational institution serving 
                                                the people of Takoradi and its 
                                                environs; and that the school 
                                                was for the use and benefit of 
                                                the public, the court held that, 
                                                that finding alone, did not make 
                                                the appellant a school &#8220;of a

												<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">
												The Statement of Claim filed 
												with the writ was, with the 
												leave of the learned trial judge 
												granted on 25<sup>th</sup> 
												February, 1993, amended.&nbsp; The 
												amended Statement of Claim 
												admitted that the Defendant was 
												until 13<sup>th</sup> September 
												1991 a director of the first 
												Plaintiff.&nbsp; It, however, averred 
												that on or about 31<sup>st</sup> 
												July 1991, the second plaintiff 
												set in motion a process which 
												led to the convening of an 
												Extraordinary General Meeting of 
												all the Directors and members of 
												the first Plaintiff for 13<sup>th</sup> 
												September 1991.&nbsp; The Statement 
												of Claim asserted that on or 
												about 13<sup>th</sup> September 
												1991, an Extraordinary General 
												Meeting of the first Plaintiff 
												took place at which the 
												Defendant was removed as a 
												Director of the first 
												Plaintiff.&nbsp; The Plaintiffs 
												averred that on or about 30<sup>th</sup> 
												September 1991, they instructed 
												their solicitor to demand from 
												the Defendant all properties of 
												the first Plaintiff in his 
												possession and to warn him to 
												desist from holding himself out 
												as a director of the first 
												Plaintiff.&nbsp; The Defendant, in 
												response, wrote to the 
												Plaintiffs&#8217; solicitor 
												challenging the basis of the 
												instructions given by the 
												Plaintiffs and refusing to 
												comply with the instructions.&nbsp; 
												Finally, the Plaintiffs pleaded 
												that the Defendant had exerted 
												undue influence over the second 
												plaintiff to sign documents in 
												his favour and that he had 
												committed various fraudulent 
												acts as a director of the first 
												Plaintiff. In response to the 
												Plaintiffs&#8217; averments, the 
												Defendant&#8217;s defence was that he 
												remained a director of the first 
												Plaintiff and that he had never 
												been validly removed as a 
												director in accordance with 
												section 185(2) of the Companies 
												Code 1963 (Act 179).&nbsp; He also 
												averred that share certificates 
												evidencing his ownership of 
												shares in the first Plaintiff 
												had been issued to him.&nbsp; He 
												counterclaimed that &#8220;by a power 
												of attorney dated 7<sup>th</sup> 
												April 1986 he was mandated to 
												run the affairs of 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Plaintiffs as acting Managing 
												Director since 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Plaintiff is old and weak and 
												could not manage the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Plaintiffs.&#8221;&nbsp; He averred that by

												gist of the case for the 
												plaintiff was that it agreed to 
												give its piling hammer and an 
												Audi saloon car in exchange of 
												the defendant&#8217;s Toyota Hilux 
												pick-up and crushing machine.&nbsp; 
												Whereas it honoured its 
												obligation and delivered the 
												equipment to the defendant, the 
												latter failed to deliver the 
												crushing machine to the 
												plaintiff. The plaintiff 
												thereafter wrote to levy charges 
												for the use of the piling 
												hammer. On the other hand, the 
												defendant denied there was any 
												agreement to hire the equipment 
												and asserted it was only an 
												agreement to swap them for each 
												other. The defendant therefore 
												denied liability and rejected 
												invoices the plaintiff submitted 
												for payment, for the reason that 
												it made the piling hammer 
												available for collection by the 
												plaintiff, but it (plaintiff) 
												refused or failed to go for it. 
												The trial judge found in his 
												judgment there was a contract of 
												hiring equipment by the parties 
												which, the defendant breached 
												and proceeded to award damages 
												for the plaintiff.&nbsp; He also 
												ordered the defendant to deliver 
												the piling hammer to the 
												plaintiff at its premises or pay 
												for the cost of the plaintiff 
												retrieving it itself, awarded 
												$300.00 (or its equivalent) per

												The facts of this case are not 
												complicated. The parties a 
												married couple are the joint 
												owners of a house the subject 
												matter of the dispute. The 
												respondent claimed that he 
												entered into negotiations with 
												the appellants for the sale of 
												their house.&nbsp; He further claimed 
												that the terms of the sale were 
												reduced into writing in the form 
												of a receipt issued to him by 
												the 1<sup>st</sup> appellant, 
												upon the payment of the first 
												instalment of the agreed price. 
												The said receipt was signed by 
												the first appellant only, 
												purportedly on behalf of himself 
												and his wife. The respondent 
												then claimed a few days later 
												after he had paid the final 
												instalment for the house, the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												appellant brought back the money 
												he had paid and indicated that 
												they were no longer interested 
												in selling the house. Several 
												attempts were made to pay back 
												the money to the respondent to 
												no avail. Eventually, the money 
												was paid back into court. The 
												respondent then brought an 
												action in the High Court seeking 
												specific performance of the 
												agreement of sale of the 
												appellants&#8217; house, recovery of 
												possession of same, general 
												damages and costs. The High 
												Court gave judgment in favour of 
												the respondent in respect of all 
												his reliefs. On appeal, the 
												Court of Appeal dismissed the 
												appellants&#8217; appeal unanimously. 
												Dissatisfied with the Court of 
												Appeal&#8217;s decision, the 
												appellants have appealed to this 
												court - <b>

												- The brief facts in this matter 
												are that the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Plaintiff (suing by one Sarah 
												Chinebuah who describes herself 
												as his lawful attorney) is the 
												son of the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Plaintiff. The 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Plaintiff was at all material 
												times normally resident in the 
												United States of America and his 
												declared intention was to 
												purchase the property for the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Plaintiff. Sometime in or about 
												January 1989, the Plaintiffs 
												expressed to the Defendant an 
												interest in purchasing the 
												property and commenced 
												negotiations with her. According 
												to the Plaintiffs&#8217; pleadings, 
												the negotiations resulted in an 
												agreement that the purchase 
												price would be ¢19,000,000.00. 
												According to the Defendant, 
												however, there was a tentatively 
												agreed price of ¢22,000,000.00 
												(now GH¢2,200.00), the final 
												price being subject to the 
												outcome of a valuation to be 
												conducted. The agreement was 
												never reduced into writing and, 
												whatever the agreed price, the 
												understanding was that the same 
												would be completely paid by May 
												1989. In April 1989, however, 
												the 1<sup>st</sup> Plaintiff 
												sent to the Defendant a tape 
												recorded message informing her 
												that, owing to the outbreak of 
												the Gulf War, he was unable to 
												complete the payment of the 
												purchase price as promised and 
												he then put the Defendant to her 
												option of either selling the 
												property to any other person or 
												waiting till the end of the said 
												war when the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Plaintiff would be able to remit 
												the money. As it transpired, 
												although the Defendant did not 
												communicate to the Plaintiffs 
												any particular choice, she did 
												not sell the property to any 
												other person and when, in July 
												1991 the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Plaintiff, through the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Plaintiff, commenced paying 
												various amounts to the Defendant 
												she accepted such payments. 
												These payments continued, 
												sporadically, until December 
												1993; by which time, as admitted 
												by the Defendant, a total amount 
												of ¢19,000,000.00 had been 
												received from the 1<sup>st</sup>

												Contract Oral - Specific

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In July, 1977 the Respondent 
												company purchased from the 
												Appellant company an IBM Copier 
												II Machine for an amount of 
												¢33,000.00. That same month the 
												Appellant company installed the 
												machine for the Respondents in 
												Cape Coast. It is quite clear 
												that up to about 1984 the 
												engineers of the Appellant 
												company serviced the said 
												machine for the Respondents, but 
												thereafter the Appellants 
												declined to do any further 
												servicing. The Respondents claim 
												that when the machine broke down 
												again in February, 1986 they 
												made several demands on the 
												Appellants to effect the 
												necessary repairs but the 
												Appellants wrongfully refused to 
												do the repairs which resulted in 
												the Respondents' inability to 
												function in their business. They 
												claimed they suffered loss. 
												Accordingly, on 17th March, 1987 
												the Respondents sued the 
												Appellants at the High Court&nbsp; 
												The Respondent took pains to set 
												out in their statement of claim 
												various particulars of the 
												alleged oral agreement. I need 
												to set out two paragraphs of the 
												statement of claim in order to 
												make for a clear appreciation of 
												the basis of the Respondents' 
												claims. The Appellants denied 
												having made any oral agreement 
												with the Respondents; they 
												claimed that the Respondents 
												declined to enter into a 
												maintenance service agreement 
												with the Appellants and insisted 
												that whatever maintenance 
												service they rendered to the 
												Respondents was on a case by 
												case basis under a scheme 
												described as &quot;On Call Basis&quot; 
												which did not create any 
												standing contract binding the 
												Appellants. In effect the 
												Appellants claimed that they 
												were not bound by any contract 
												which the Respondents could call 
												upon them to specifically 
												perform.<font color="#FF0000">

												Managing Director and the 
												Respondent.Upon completion of

												though under Article 218 of the 
												Constitution, if the Commission 
												desires that its recommendations 
												should be enforced, it must 
												apply to the court for 
												appropriate orders, the 
												Plaintiff did not wait for such

												April 2002, which made adverse 
												findings against the Plaintiff 
												is absurd, perverse, illogical

												- Following the victory of the 
												New Patriotic Party (NPP) in the 
												December 2000 parliamentary and 
												presidential elections, Mr. J. 
												A. Kufuor was sworn in as the 
												President of the Republic on 7th 
												January 2001. Not long 
												thereafter, a number of persons 
												were announced as assisting the 
												President in the performance of 
												his official duties. Three of 
												such persons are Mr. Jake 
												Obetsebi-Lamptey, Elizabeth 
												Ohene and Joshua Hamidu. Taking 
												the view that the appointments 
												of these persons were improper, 
												Mr. Martin Amidu, filed the 
												instant action at the Supreme 
												Court, against Mr. J. A. Kufuor 
												as 1st defendant, the 
												Attorney-General as 2nd

												(Act 463) the 3rd, 4th and 5th 
												defendants cannot be appointed 
												by the President as staff of the 
												Presidential office without 
												consultation with the Council of 
												State. The conduct of the 1st 
												Defendant President John Agyekum 
												Kufuor, in appointing 3rd, 4th 
												and 5th Defendants as staff of 
												the Presidential office without 
												consultation with the Council of 
												State is inconsistent with and 
												in contravention of the latter 
												and spirit of the Constitution. 
												The conduct of the 3rd, 4th and 
												5th defendants in holding 
												themselves out and action as 
												officers or staff in the office 
												of the President is inconsistent 
												with and in contravention of the 
												Constitution. Accordingly, all 
												acts undertaken by the 3rd, 4th 
												and 5th defendants as officers 
												or staff in the office of the 
												President are inconsistent with

												Constitution, null, void and

												Constitution - Interpretation of 
												Article - Regional Tribunal</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
												- On&nbsp; 15th July,&nbsp; 1997, 
												Constable Yebbi and Cpl. Avalifo 
												were arraigned before the 
												Greater Accra Regional Tribunal 
												on charges of conspiracy to 
												steal and stealing 
												¢100,000,000.00 contrary to 
												section 23(1) and 124(1)&nbsp; 
												respectively of the Criminal 
												Code 1960 (Act 29). The money is 
												said to belong to the National 
												Democratic Congress (NDC), a 
												political party registered under 
												the Political Parties 
												Registration Law 1992, (PNDCL 
												281). In the course of the trial 
												the accused challenged the 
												jurisdiction of the tribunal. 
												They pointed out that under 
												Article 143(1) of the 1992 
												Constitution, a regional 
												tribunal has jurisdiction to try 
												such offences against the state 
												and public interest as 
												Parliament may by law prescribe. 
												But the offences they were 
												facing could not be said to be 
												against the state or public 
												interest since the money 
												involved was admitted to belong 
												to a political party which 
												obviously is not a state 
												institution, neither is the 
												theft of a political party's 
												money, an offence against public 
												interest. A Regional Tribunal 
												can therefore not try such an 
												offence. The prosecution sought 
												to resist the objection by 
												contending that once Parliament 
												has exercised its discretion by 
												enacting in the Court's Act 1993 
												(Act 459) section 24(1) thereof, 
												that a regional tribunal has 
												jurisdiction in all criminal 
												matters, it follows that the 
												tribunal was seised with 
												jurisdiction in the matter. But 
												the accused in reply submitted 
												that section 24(1) of Act 459 is 
												not consistent with Article 
												143(1) of the 1992 Constitution 
												and consequently null and void. 
												The trial Regional Tribunal 
												accordingly referred the 
												following issues to this court 
												under Article 130(2) of the 1992 
												Constitution - <b>

												The Plaintiff&#8217;s case is simply 
												that under the 1992 
												constitutional arrangement on 
												finance, there are two broad 
												ways in which moneys can be 
												withdrawn from the consolidated 
												fund as provided under article 
												178 (1), the first being 
												expenditure that is charged on 
												the fund by either&nbsp; the 
												constitution or by an Act of 
												Parliament.&nbsp; On this premise, 
												his argument is that 
												parliamentary approval is not 
												required for payments 
												specifically charged to the 
												consolidated fund as provided 
												under the articles 178 (1) (a) 
												and 187 (14).&nbsp; Furthermore, he 
												contends that, since by virtue 
												of article 187 (14), the 
												administrative expenses of the 
												office&nbsp; Auditor- General, 
												including all salaries, 
												allowances, gratuities and 
												pensions payable to and in 
												respect of persons serving in 
												the audit service is a direct 
												charge on the consolidated fund, 
												when the Audit Service Board, 
												acting in consultation with the 
												Public Services Commission as is 
												mandated under article 189 (3), 
												determines the terms and 
												conditions of its serving 
												officers and employees, these 
												become automatically due for 
												implementation on the effective 
												date(s) and no person or 
												authority has power to vary any 
												part of the conditions of 
												service so determined. Even more 
												forcefully, he urged that in 
												terms of article 179(2), once 
												the administrative expenses of 
												the Service, have been 
												determined in compliance with 
												articles 189 (1), (2) and (3) of 
												the 1992 constitution, the 
												payment of these estimates are 
												not in any way subject to a 
												downward review by the executive 
												branch of government, either by 
												the President acting by himself 
												or through his Minister of

												<b>Law - Article 145(2)(b) - 
												Maximum age for High Court 
												Judges - </b>The Applicant is 
												asking us for two reliefs, 
												either cumulatively or in the 
												alternative. In either case, the 
												result will be to disqualify Mr 
												Justice D. K. Afreh, Justice of 
												the Supreme Court, from sitting 
												as an Additional Judge of the 
												High Court. In seeking to 
												disqualify Mr Justice Afreh, the 
												Applicant argues that on a 
												proper reading of Article 
												145(2)(b) of the Constitution, 
												he is not competent to sit in 
												the High Court because he has 
												passed the age of 65 which is 
												the prescribed maximum age for 
												High Court Judges.The Applicant 
												also argues that, in any event, 
												having attained the age of 70 
												years in March, Mr Justice Afreh 
												cannot continue to sit in any 
												Court except for a six month 
												period to complete cases which 
												had been commenced before him 
												pursuant to Article 145(2) of 
												the Constitution. In support of 
												this second ground, the 
												Applicant says that, although Mr 
												Justice Afreh had dealt with 
												some interlocutory matters in 
												their case, the proceedings had 
												not actually commenced before 
												him within the intendment of 
												Article 145(4) of the 
												Constitution. As regards Mr 
												Justice Afreh&quot;s capacity to sit 
												as an Additional Judge of the 
												High Court, the Applicant's 
												contention is that, Article 
												145(2)(b) squarely catches him 
												and disqualifies him. We are 
												accordingly urged to read 
												Article 145(2)(b) of the 
												Constitution. In our opinion, 
												Article 145(2)(b) of our 
												Constitution is unambiguous and 
												allows for no argument. It 
												expressly states that a Judge of 
												the High Court must retire on 
												attainment of 65 years of age. 
												It means that a High Court Judge 
												must vacate his office upon 
												attainment of 65 years, 
												otherwise, excepting for the 
												grace period of six months to 
												wind up cases by virtue of 
												Article 145(4), anything done by 
												him thereafter is a nullity. It 
												also implies that a person who 
												is 65 years or older cannot be 
												appointed to the office of Judge 
												of the High Court. Therefore, 
												the Applicant extrapolates from 
												these valid premises to contend 
												that, as Mr Justice Afreh had 
												attained the age of 65, his 
												designation as an Additional 
												Judge of the High Court by the 
												Chief Justice is in 
												contravention of a clear and 
												undebatable provision of the 
												Constitution, to wit Article 
												145(2)(b) thereof. The logic of 
												the Applicant's position is 
												that, if Mr Justice Afreh was 
												not qualified to hold the office 
												of a High Court Judge by reason 
												of his age, the Chief Justice 
												cannot appoint him as an 
												Additional Judge of the High 
												Court where he is 
												constitutionally prohibited from 
												sitting. We agree with the 
												Applicant that if Mr Justice 
												Afreh is disqualified from 
												sitting in the High Court, the 
												Chief Justice or the President 
												of the Republic of Ghana must 
												not be allowed to circumvent the 
												Constitution by installing him 
												there under a different guise. 
												The maxim of the law is what 
												Coke stated ages ago that quando 
												a liquid prohibetur fieri ex 
												dirceto prohibetur et obliquum: 
												when a thing is prohibited, it 
												cannot be done either directly 
												or indirectly with the purpose 
												of achieving the prohibited 
												result. The maxim applies even 
												more forcefully when the 
												prohibition is mandated by the 
												Constitution. The Constitution 
												is the fundamental law of the 
												land and every authority is 
												bound by its explicit 
												provisions, such as Article 
												145(2)(b). Therefore, the 
												question is whether the 
												designation of Mr Justice Afreh, 
												who is admittedly over 65 years 
												old, to sit as an Additional 
												Judge of the High Court, is an 
												attempt to circumvent the age 
												restriction imposed on High 
												Court Judges. If it is such an 
												attempt to do directly or 
												indirectly what the Constitution 
												forbids, we must declare it to 
												be unconstitutional and accede 
												to the Applicant's prayer by 
												issuing an order of prohibition 
												to stop him from so sitting.- <b>

												This is an appeal from the

												affirming the decision of the 
												High Court. The appeal was heard 
												and adjourned to 31st March, 
												2000 for judgment. The court 
												realised later that a legal 
												point which had been raised when 
												an application for stay of 
												execution was brought and which 
												legal issue had more or less 
												influenced the granting of an 
												order of stay of execution, had 
												not been repeated in the 
												subsequent submissions made 
												during the hearing of the 
												substantive appeal by either

												gave the parties reasonable

												Rule 6(8) of the Supreme Court 
												Rules, 1996 (C.I. 16). Counsel

												from the official records of the

												the Service on 12th September, 
												1992.Article 145(2) of the

												Chairman of a Regional Tribunal 
												shall vacate his office (a)&nbsp;&nbsp; in 
												the case of a Justice of the 
												Supreme Court or the Court of 
												Appeal, on attaining the age of 
												seventy years; or(b)&nbsp; in the 
												case of a Justice of the High 
												Court or a Chairman of a 
												Regional Tribunal, on attaining 
												the age of sixty-five years; 
												or(c)&nbsp; upon his removal from 
												office in accordance with 
												article 146 of this 
												Constitution&quot;.Sub-clause (4) of 
												this article however, provides 
												that&#8212;&quot;(4)&nbsp; Notwithstanding that 
												he has attained the age at which 
												he is required by this article 
												to vacate his office, a person 
												holding office as a Justice of a 
												Superior Court or Chairman of a 
												Regional Tribunal may continue 
												in office for a period not 
												exceeding six months after 
												attaining that age, as may be 
												necessary to enable him to 
												deliver judgment or do any other 
												thing in relation to proceedings 
												that were commenced before him 
												previous to his attaining that 
												age&quot; (emphasis supplied).This 
												provision allows a retired 
												Superior Court judge who 
												otherwise would have retired at 
												the compulsory retiring age, to 
												continue in office for a period 
												not exceeding six months as may 
												be necessary for him to deliver 
												judgment or do any other thing 
												in relation to proceedings that 
												commenced before him previous to 
												his attaining that age. It is 
												not the intention of the framers 
												of the Constitution that the 
												retiring judge should 
												automatically continue for the 
												maximum period of six months; 
												the retiring judge may be given 
												less than the six months but any 
												period given him shall not 
												exceed six months.The evidence 
												before us shows that the 
												judgment of the High Court was 
												delivered outside the 
												constitutionally permissive 
												period, albeit by another judge 
												who was a sitting judge. Outside 
												the six months period no judge 
												had jurisdiction to deliver the 
												judgment on behalf of the 
												retired judge. Since the 
												judgment was delivered about two 
												years after the judge had 
												retired, the proceedings after 
												the six months period were a 
												nullity: delivering that 
												judgment by a sitting judge 
												could not validate the otherwise 
												unlawful proceedings. 
												Accordingly, we would allow the 
												appeal and set aside the 
												judgment of both the Court of 
												Appeal and the High Court 
												together with all costs awarded, 
												if any. We would order that the 
												case be remitted to the High 
												Court to be expeditiously tried

												Constitution to interpret and 
												enforce the provisions of the 
												Constitution, is a special

												particular course of action at a 
												lower court, this court shall 
												refuse to assume jurisdiction in 
												that action, notwithstanding the 
												fact that it has been presented 
												as an interpretation and/or

												number of actions which fall 
												within specific causes of action 
												can be presented in the form of

												invoking its original

												his right to his property under 
												article 18 of the 1992

												Affidavit Verifying Facts and 
												Particulars, together with 
												Statement of Plaintiffs case but 
												inadvertently did not attach the 
												Writ to it. At the hearing the 
												Defendants raised a preliminary 
												objection to the Plaintiffs 
												action and applied for same to 
												be struck out on the ground that 
												the Plaintiff did not initiate 
												any action as required under by 
												the mandatory provision of Rule 
												45 (1) C.I. 16. &#8220;Except as 
												otherwise provided in these 
												Rules, an action brought to 
												invoke the original jurisdiction 
												of this Court shall be commenced 
												by a writ in the form 27 set out 
												in Part III of the Schedule to 
												these Rules which shall be 
												signed by the Plaintiff or his 
												Counsel &#8221;The above requirements 
												were not complied with and 
												therefore no action having been 
												initiated by a Writ the other 
												documents filed on 14/9/99 were 
												of no consequence and null and 
												void. The Plaintiff&#8217;s request in 
												the Supplementary Affidavit 
												filed on 30/9/99, that the said 
												invalid documents to attached to 
												the Writ filed on 30/9/99 is 
												misconceived. It is not for the 
												Registrar of this Court to 
												rectify any lapses in the filing 
												of papers for parties who fail 
												to comply with Rules of 
												procedure nor has been given any 
												power to do so.&nbsp; Neither can 
												invalid and void documents be 
												resurrected and given life by 
												attaching same to a later valid 
												document. The Defendants' 
												submission that there is no case 
												before the court is therefore 
												valid<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="2000A/DR.%20JACOB%20EMMANUEL%20OPPONG %20v.%20ATTORNEY-GENERAL,%20FOR%20AND%20ON%20B.htm">

												Constitutional Law - Removal of 
												Judicial office - Chief justice 
												- </span></b>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The events which have provoked 
												this action may be stated as 
												follows: By a letter from the 
												office of the President, dated 
												20th March, 2000 and addressed 
												to the Plaintiff, the plaintiff 
												was informed as follows: H.E. 
												the President has accepted the 
												recommendation of the Judicial 
												Council, given in accordance 
												with L.I.319, Section 28(2) of 
												the Judicial Service 
												Regulations, 1963 and has 
												directed your immediate 
												redeployment out the Judicial 
												Service for displaying a high 
												degree of incompetence in the 
												discharge of your duties&#8221;. By 
												his writ herein, the Plaintiff 
												seeks from this Court a 
												declaration that his removal 
												from the Judicial Service as a 
												Judicial Officer by the 
												President, for the reasons 
												stated, is contrary to Article 
												151(1) of the Constitution.&nbsp; In 
												his Statement of Case in support 
												of his claim, the Plaintiff, who 
												until the said letter held the 
												position of 2nd Deputy Judicial 
												Secretary, contended that: a. 
												The effect of the President&#8217;s 
												letter was to remove him from 
												his judicial office b. Such 
												removal was in punishment for 
												allegations made against him and 
												which he was not given any 
												opportunity to be heard in his 
												defence, contrary to Section 25 
												of the Judicial Service Act&nbsp; c. 
												Since the coming into force of 
												the Constitution, the provisions 
												of Regulation 28(2) of the 
												Judicial Service Regulations 
												either ceased to apply for the 
												purposes of removing a judicial 
												officer, or its application must 
												be with such modifications as 
												are necessary to bring those 
												provisions in conformity with 
												Article 151 of the Constitution 
												d. By virtue of Article 151, it 
												is only the Chief justice who 
												has the power to remove a 
												Judicial Officer from office and 
												such removal may only be upon 
												the grounds and pursuant to the 
												process stipulated therein. The 
												Honourable Attorney-General, in 
												his Statement of Case, contended 
												that the holding of the position 
												of 2nd Deputy Judicial secretary 
												did not make the Plaintiff a 
												Judicial Officer, since the 
												position of a Judicial Officer 
												is a creature of the law and is 
												one which cannot be created 
												outside Article 161 of the 
												Constitution of Section 32 of 
												the Judicial Service Act.&nbsp; - <b>

                                                thrust of the argument is that, 
                                                the 1992 Constitution omits to 
                                                state the exact retiring age of 
                                                the Auditor &#8211;General, whereas 
                                                that of other analogous public 
                                                office holders who are in the 
                                                same class have had &nbsp;their 
                                                constitutionally compulsory 
                                                retiring ages pegged to that of 
                                                Justices of the Court of Appeal. 
                                                It was urged that the correct 
                                                constitutional &nbsp;position in 
                                                context, is that on a true and 
                                                proper construction of the 
                                                constitutional provisions 
                                                relating to these other public 
                                                office holders, the Auditor &#8211; 
                                                General is entitled to retire at 
                                                age seventy. The corollary 
                                                argument is that the s. 10 of 
                                                the &nbsp;Audit Service Act 2000 (Act 
                                                528), which sets the retiring 
                                                age at 60, basing itself on 
                                                articles 190, 195, and 199 is 
                                                clearly inconsistent with the 
                                                constitution, void to the extent 
                                                of the inconsistency, and the

												This is a motion invoking the&nbsp; 
												supervisory jurisdiction of the 
												Supreme Court, under Article 132 
												of the Constitution for the 
												Order of Certiorari directed to 
												the High Court Accra to quash 
												its judgment given on 25th 
												January 2002 in Suit 
												No.C398/7.The ground for this 
												application is that:&#8220;The 
												judgment is null and void 
												because at the time it was 
												given&nbsp; the six week period 
												prescribed by the rules for it 
												to be delivered had elapsed.&#8221;The 
												facts are that the present 
												applicant was Defendant in the 
												High Court case Suit No. 
												C898/97. The plaintiff therein 
												instituted an action against the 
												applicant seeking the following 
												reliefs:&#8212;a) The export value of 
												sea food assessed at 
												FF.88,318,50 or its equivalent 
												.b) Interest at the commercial 
												bank lending rate calculated&nbsp; 
												from the date of 1st demand 
												until the date of payment and c) 
												Damages for breach of contract. 
												After the hearing of evidence 
												in&nbsp; the case had been completed, 
												the plaintiff filed its address 
												on 8th December 1999 and 
												Defendant also filed its address 
												on 28th January 2000. The case 
												was then adjourned for judgment 
												by the trial High Court which 
												was eventually delivered on the 
												25th January 2002 in favour of 
												the Plaintiff for all the 
												reliefs sought. According to the 
												applicant since the judgment was 
												delivered almost 2 years after 
												the&nbsp; close of the case in the 
												High Court, instead of the 
												stipulated 6 weeks as contained&nbsp; 
												in Order 63 (2A) of L.N. 140A as 
												amended by L.I 1107 the judgment 
												is null and void and ought to be 
												so declared and quashed by 
												certiorari. The relevant rule 
												relied on is L.I 1107 which 
												amends&nbsp; Order 63 by adding rule 
												2A to Order 63 as contained in 
												the High Court (Civil Procedure) 
												(Amendment) Rules 1977 L.I

												<span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
												The factual context within which 
												the Court&#8217;s task of 
												interpretation is to be carried 
												out is as follows:&nbsp; the third 
												defendant, Mr. Phillip David 
												Elders, a businessman resident 
												in Texas, USA, identified a 
												business opportunity in Ghana 
												and persuaded the owner of the 
												second defendant to invest in 
												it.&nbsp; The business opportunity 
												was as follows: the Government 
												of Ghana wanted to generate 
												electricity urgently from a 
												power barge located in its 
												Western Region.&nbsp; The barge 
												needed rehabilitation and the 
												Government wanted to negotiate 
												with a private investor to 
												achieve this and bring its 
												generating capacity urgently on 
												stream.&nbsp; With a view to 
												achieving this, Balkan Energy 
												LLC, the second defendant, 
												entered into a Memorandum of 
												Understanding (&#8220;MOU&#8221;) with the 
												Government of Ghana on 16<sup>th</sup> 
												May 2007.&nbsp; Because of advice 
												that was given to the third 
												defendant relating to the 
												statutory licensing requirements 
												in Ghana for power generation, 
												the investors in the business 
												opportunity decided to 
												incorporate the first defendant 
												in Ghana and to make it the 
												party to a Power Purchase 
												Agreement, the interpretation of 
												a provision in which constitutes 
												the subject matter of the 
												reference to this Court.&nbsp; 
												Accordingly, on 27<sup>th</sup> 
												July 2007, Balkan Energy (Ghana) 
												Limited, the first defendant, 
												which had been incorporated in 
												Ghana 11 days previously, 
												entered into a Power Purchase 
												Agreement (&#8220;PPA&#8221;) with the 
												Government of Ghana.&nbsp; 
												Subsequently, a dispute arose 
												between the parties to this PPA.&nbsp; 
												The Government of Ghana claimed 
												that the second and third 
												defendants had misrepresented to 
												it that they could make the 
												power barge operational within 
												90 working days and that it was 
												on the basis of this 
												misrepresentation that it had 
												entered into the MOU and the PPA., 
												the Attorney-General, the 
												principal legal adviser to the 
												Government of Ghana and the 
												nominal party expected to 
												represent the State in 
												litigation before the Ghanaian 
												courts, in June 2010, issued a 
												Writ of Summons in the 
												Commercial Division of the High 
												Court, Accra, claiming a 
												declaration that the PPA is an 
												international business 
												transaction that needed 
												Parliamentary approval and was 
												unenforceable because it did not 
												have such approval.&nbsp;-

												According to the Applicants, 
												they are registered members of a 
												company limited by guarantee 
												called the Kejetia Traders 
												Association, also known as 
												Mighty 18. The 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Respondent is the Chairman of 
												the Association. Sometime in 
												1993, the Kumasi Metropolitan 
												Assembly (KMA) ordered the 
												members of the Association, who 
												were legitimately carrying on 
												their business in Kejetia to 
												quit their place of business as 
												the Government of Ghana wanted 
												to redesign and develop the 
												area. Consequently, the 
												Association in collaboration 
												with the KMA managed to secure a 
												commercial property belonging to 
												the State Housing Corporation at 
												North Suntreso, Kumasi, for the 
												construction of stores. It was 
												agreed that the construction 
												would be pre-financed by members 
												of the Association who were 
												interested in acquiring the 
												stores by paying the sum of Two 
												Million One Hundred Thousand 
												cedis each at the time.
												For one reason or the other, the 
												KMA was unable to meet its part 
												of the bargain to allocate the 
												stores to the members of the 
												Association which resulted in 
												the successful institution of a 
												suit against the KMA. The KMA 
												was compelled by an order of 
												specific performance to allocate 
												the stores to the paid up 
												members of the Association whose 
												names were contained in a list 
												prepared by the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Respondent, then the Plaintiff 
												in that matter. Some members of 
												the Association who had taken 
												possession of some of the stores 
												but it was alleged had not 
												contributed towards its 
												construction were ejected by the 
												orders of the court. Feeling 
												aggrieved by this decision, the 
												Applicants herein instituted 
												another suit in the High Court 
												Kumasi against the Chairman of 
												the Association. They were 
												successful in that attempt but 
												it was overturned on Appeal in 
												the Court of Appeal. The 
												Applicants armed with their 
												victory in the High Court had in 
												the mean time taken possession 
												and occupation of twenty-eight 
												of the forty four stores whilst 
												the matter was on Appeal. Not 
												long afterwards, the Government 
												of Ghana compulsorily acquired 
												the property on which the block 
												of stores was situate to allow 
												for the construction of the 
												Sunyani-Kumasi road.The 
												Association was duly compensated 
												for the acquisition in the sum 
												of GH¢392,062.90, which cheque 
												was drawn up in the name of the 
												Association and by an order of 
												the High Court deposited at the 
												Kumasi Central Branch of the 
												National Investment Bank, 
												pending the outcome of the 
												Appeal.On the 22<sup>nd</sup> of 
												May 2008, the Court of Appeal 
												gave judgment in favour of the 1<sup>st</sup>

												proceeded to go into execution 
												by filing an entry of Judgment. </span>

												be paid up to that day and also 
												be paid three months salary in 
												lieu of notice.&nbsp; The letter 
												further informed him that he 
												would receive a severance award 
												of two and a half months pay for 
												each year of service, commencing 
												from 1<sup>st</sup> January 
												1991.At the meeting with the 
												managing-director, the plaintiff 
												was given his three months 
												salary in lieu of notice and two 
												days salary for December 1996.&nbsp; 
												He was also paid monetary 
												compensation for his accrued 
												leave days.&nbsp; On the 5<sup>th</sup> 
												of December 1996, the Plaintiff 
												collected from the Accounts 
												Department of the Defendant the 
												severance award referred to 
												above. After thus collecting the 
												compensation offered in the 
												letter of 29<sup>th</sup> 
												November, 1996, the Plaintiff 
												caused his lawyer to write a 
												letter to the defendant dated 29<sup>th</sup> 
												January 1997 which asserted that 
												the Senior Staff Service 
												Conditions of the defendant 
												dated 1<sup>st</sup> April 1995 
												contained no provision covering 
												redundancy.&nbsp; It characterized 
												the defendant&#8217;s action in 
												terminating the plaintiff&#8217;s 
												employment as smacking of 
												arbitrariness and injustice.&nbsp; It 
												expressed the view that the 
												defendant&#8217;s declaration of the 
												plaintiff redundant was unlawful 
												at law and in breach of the 
												Industrial Relations Act 1965, 
												Act 299.&nbsp; It requested the 
												holding of amicable bilateral 
												discussions to resolve the 
												dispute. <b>

												</b>The facts are that in March 
												1984, Umarco Ltd. who are agents 
												of the appellants took delivery 
												of 2470 cartons of wine for 
												onward transmission to the 
												respondent&#8217;s bonded warehouse.

												for personal use and paid duty

												declared 43 cartons broken and 
												consequently delivered only 
												2,035 cartons of the consignment 
												to the appellants, implying a 
												short landing of 344 cartons 
												which were never handed over to 
												the appellants. The appellants 
												allege that not only did the 
												respondents wrongfully demand 
												duty on the three hundred and 
												forty-four (344) cartons which 
												were never delivered, but also 
												wrongfully seized 400 cartons in 
												lieu of the duty on the 344 
												cartonsThe respondents&#8217; main 
												defence to the action is that in 
												view of an agreement voluntarily 
												reached by the parties, the 
												appellants were estopped from 
												laying any claim against the 
												respondents. Additionally, they 
												allege that it was the appellant 
												who voluntarily agreed, per the

												314 cartons, and were compelled

												On 28<sup>th</sup> day of July,

												accompanying statement of claim 
												to be issued against the 
												defendants. Plaintiff&#8217;s case as 
												gleaned from the pliant is that, 
												it is a United Kingdom based 
												student recruitment agency with 
												offices in Ghana, Kenya Nigeria 
												and the United Kingdom (U.K)The 
												2<sup>nd</sup> defendant was 
												described as the Managing

												defendant organization and that, 
												she was in the employment of 
												plaintiff as it&#8217;s office Manager 
												from May, 2006, to May 2009. 
												Furthermore, it was alleged 
												that, whiles, 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												defendant was working for 
												plaintiff, she had been given 
												both verbal and written warnings 
												to improve her performance but 
												she failed or refused to do so.&nbsp; 
												And that as a result she was

												</span>
												<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
												On the other hand, the defence 
												has alleged that following an 
												advertisement in the Daily 
												Graphic, a Ghanaian newspaper, 
												by the plaintiff in 2005, 
												advertising a vacancy for Office 
												Manager, 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												defendant applied and was 
												invited for an interview.&nbsp; It 
												has been alleged that 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												defendant was selected after the 
												interview conducted by Directors 
												of plaintiff company, and she 
												was given the job of Office 
												Manager, by word of mouth, and 
												without a formal contract, with 
												a promise that a formal contract 
												will be worked on upon the 
												arrival of the Directors in 
												United Kingdom (U.K). 
												Furthermore, 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												defendant, alleged she started 
												work without a formal contract, 
												in May 2005, and that an 
												unsigned letter was sent to her, 
												offering her the job, and that 
												upon reading the letter, she did 
												not accept some terms in the 
												letter, and this was made known 
												to plaintiff, who withdrew the 
												offer letter.&nbsp; The fact that 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												defendant&#8217;s name was wrongly 
												stated, lack of provision of 
												SSNIT &#8211; i.e. pension payments, 
												as required by the National 
												Pension&#8217;s Act, 2008, Act 766 It 
												is plaintiff&#8217;s case that the 2<sup>nd</sup>

												in its contract with plaintiff 
												by establishing the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												defendant company within three 
												(3) years after leaving 
												plaintiff&#8217;s employment. - <b><u>

												The Appellant who carries on 
												business in Ghana as civil 
												engineers had secured a contract 
												from Glahco Hotels &amp; Tourism 
												Development Co. Ltd, owners of 
												the Golden Tulip Hotel, to do 
												civil engineering works in the 
												new Executive Wing of the hotel. 
												Their contract permitted 
												subcontracting. The Respondents 
												are renowned refrigeration 
												engineers. They are based in 
												Cyprus. The Appellants invited 
												them to be Sub-Contractors, for 
												the supply, engineering and 
												installation of a Heating 
												Ventilation and Air-Conditioning 
												System (HVAC) in the Executive 
												Wing of the Hotel.Between May 
												and November 1996, discussions 
												took place between the 
												Appellants and the Respondents 
												about the subcontract, but 
												nothing concrete materialised 
												from those discussions. The 
												Appellants themselves signed 
												their agreement with Glahco 
												Hotels, etc, in September 1996. 
												According to the Respondents, 
												the Appellants warned them in 
												November 1996 not to expect any 
												sub-contract. However, on or 
												about the 26th of November 1996 
												the Appellants informed the 
												Respondents that the 
												sub-contract was available and 
												that if they were still 
												interested they should come down 
												to start the job immediately. 
												This urgency was probably due to 
												the fact that according to the 
												Appellants their own contract 
												with the owners required them to 
												have an air-conditioning 
												engineer on the site by October 
												1996. The Respondents replied, 
												accepting the offer, and 
												prepared feverishly to move to 
												the site. The Respondents' 
												Managing Director testified that 
												he came to Ghana on 7th December 
												1996, expecting to sign a 
												sub-contract but the Appellants 
												contract Manager was busy and 
												did not have time to go through 
												the details of the sub-contract 
												with him. Between 19th and 21st 
												December 1996, the Respondents 
												held discussions with the 
												Appellants on the terms of the 
												subcontract and on 23rd December 
												1996, minutes of their meeting 
												were signed. The minutes were 
												tendered in evidence as Exhibit 
												G. It contained the main terms 
												of their contract. The parties 
												further considered a draft 
												sub-contract. It was a standard 
												form contract used in the 
												building industry. They made 
												several changes there-to, by way 
												of additions, outright 
												cancellations or substitution.-<a href="2003A/KLIMATECHNIK%20ENGINEERING%20LTD%20v.%20SKANSKA%20JENSEN%20INTERNATIONAL.htm">

                                                transaction. He protested but 
                                                subsequently signed upon the 
                                                assurances given by the agent 
                                                that the terms of the agreement 
                                                would not be enforced since they 
                                                were good friends. According to 
                                                him, the disbursement of the 
                                                loan was made in tranches and 
                                                not one -time as asserted by the 
                                                plaintiff. &nbsp;In the course of 
                                                time, the Apagyahene had to 
                                                intervene. He invited the 
                                                Plaintiff for a discussion on 
                                                the matter as a result of which 
                                                the Plaintiff offered to take 
                                                interest on the borrowed sum.-

												The key facts in this appeal are 
												that a farming company (the 
												plaintiff/respondent/respondent) 
												entered into a loan agreement 
												with a bank (the 
												defendant/appellant/appellant) 
												to finance the importation of 10 
												tractors from France.&nbsp; On their 
												arrival in Ghana, the farming 
												company took delivery and 
												custody of the tractors.&nbsp; 
												Dissatisfied with this, the bank 
												seized the tractors and put them 
												in its warehouse.&nbsp; It released 5 
												of the tractors to the company 
												only after new terms had been 
												agreed between them.&nbsp; The 
												remaining five remained in the 
												bank&#8217;s custody until they were

												The bank claimed to be 
												exercising rights under the

												had concluded with the farming 
												company.&nbsp; But this agreement was 
												never put in evidence at the 
												trial.&nbsp; Eventually, the five

												were also seized by the bank and

												telephone services in Ghana.&nbsp; By 
												a dealership agreement entered 
												into by the company and&nbsp; 
												Superphone Co Ltd, the

												copy of which was attached to 
												the affidavit in support and 
												marked HCN 2, the said agreement 
												was terminated by the first 
												applicant.Following the 
												termination, the interested 
												party instituted an action in 
												the High Court (Commercial 
												Division) Accra, claiming the 
												following reliefs against the 
												first applicant: a declaration 
												that the notice of intention to 
												terminate the&nbsp; dealership 
												agreement between it and the 
												defendant company does not 
												amount to a termination of the 
												said agreement and as such the 
												dealership agreement dated 16 
												November 2007 between the

												them;further declaration that 
												clause 8.3(b) of the agreement 
												aforesaid which gives the 
												defendant the right to terminate 
												the said agreement forthwith on 
												grounds of 'territory invasion' 
												is vague, unreasonable and 
												unconscionable and as such 
												inapplicable by virtue of the 
												provisions of clause 10.4 of the 
												said agreement; a further 
												declaration that the conduct of 
												the defendant in allowing a 
												rival dealer to operate within 
												the plaintiff's territory is 
												tantamount to an undue 
												interference in and a disruption 
												of the plaintiff's business;a 
												further declaration that the

												discrimination and such is 
												entitled to protection under the 
												Protection Against Unfair

												The facts of the case should be 
												narrated next to enable an 
												appreciation of the issues of 
												law raised in the case.&nbsp; The 
												respondent, who was the 
												plaintiff in the trial court, is 
												the author of a novel entitled: 
												&#8220;<u>Woes of the African Mother&#8221;</u>, 
												(hereinafter referred to as <u>
												&#8220;Woes</u>&#8221;) which was first 
												published in August 1982.&nbsp; This 
												novel was selected by the West 
												African Examination Council as 
												one of the prescribed texts for 
												prose in the English Language 
												paper for the academic years 
												2004 to 2006 for the Basic 
												Education Certificate 
												Examination (&#8220;BECE&#8221;).&nbsp; The 
												respondent, in his action 
												commenced at the Commercial 
												Division of the High Court, 
												Accra, on 10<sup>th</sup> 
												November 2005, claimed that, 
												following a meeting of the 
												Directors of the Ghana Education 
												Service (&#8220;GES&#8221;) on the 
												literature component of the 
												Basic School English Language 
												examination, it was decided that 
												Junior Secondary School I pupils 
												should be examined for prose in,
												<i>inter alia,</i> the 
												respondent&#8217;s novel.&nbsp; A 
												recommendation was therefore 
												made that 450,000 copies of the 
												respondent&#8217;s novel at a unit 
												cost of 20,000 cedis be 
												ordered.&nbsp; The respondent&#8217;s 
												grievance was that the appellant 
												had published a work entitled &#8220;<u>Gateway 
												to English for Junior Secondary 
												Schools Pupil&#8217;s Book 3&#8221;</u>, 
												(hereinafter referred to as &#8220;<u>Gateway</u>&#8221;) 
												which included, as Appendix 6, a 
												summary of the respondent&#8217;s 
												novel.&nbsp; The respondent averred 
												that by including his work as 
												Appendix 6 in its publication, 
												the appellant had in effect 
												rendered the recommendation by 
												the GES to purchase 450,000 
												copies of his novel nugatory and 
												therefore caused him great loss 
												and damage. - <b>

												The Plaintiff a company

												Exhibit A, the sole agent in 
												Ghana of the branded products of 
												Pierson Munier &amp; Company (PMC), 
												a company incorporated under the 
												laws of the United Kingdom. In 
												1980, the Defendant took over 
												PMC and retained the Plaintiff 
												as its agent. The parties 
												executed a document, Exhibit B, 
												dated 31 July 1980, by which 
												Exhibit A was varied by changes 
												in the brand name of products 
												named in the agreement and by 
												the introduction of a 90 day 
												written notice requirement for 
												the termination of the 
												agreement. Mr. Hendrik Anno 
												Vanderveen a legal adviser to 
												the defendant company who 
												represented the Defendant at the 
												hearing admitted in 
												cross-examination that Exhibit A 
												was validated by the Defendant. 
												Some of the branded products 
												were Peak Milk, Dutch Baby Food 
												and Frisolac. According to the 
												Plaintiff, it was a clear 
												understanding of the parties 
												that their relationship was to 
												be governed not only by the 
												Agency Agreement but by the 
												customs, practices, and 
												regulations of the European 
												Community, England and /or 
												Holland.&nbsp; The defendant 
												terminated the agency agreement 
												in January 1994 by giving the 
												plaintiff the requisite 90 days 
												notice and offered the latter 
												and amount of NLG 120,000 
												(equivalent of $70,000) as 
												compensation. The plaintiff was 
												dissatisfied with the 
												termination of the agreement and 
												rejected the quantum of

												it had promoted and expanded and 
												established a thriving market in 
												Ghana for the brand products of

												The grounds for the application

												September, 2011 restrained both 
												the Applicant and Respondents 
												&nbsp;from undertaking any 
												development on the land which is 
												subject of dispute between them 
												pending the hearing of an 
												application for interlocutory

												of the court the Respondents 
												went onto the land and continued 
												with developments.&nbsp; To buttress 
												the developments the Respondents 
												were carrying out the Applicant 
												exhibited some pictures of 
												people carrying out developments 
												on a land.&nbsp; The Applicant also 
												exhibited the restraining

												Criminal law - Armed robbery -

												The facts upon which the charges 
												were laid against the accused 
												were that, in the small hours of 
												27<sup>th</sup> July 2005, five 
												men with one of them wearing a 
												mask, attacked the complainants 
												in three houses within a 100 
												meters radius at West Anaji, a 
												suburb of Takoradi, and 
												succeeded in making away with 
												properties valued at ¢8 million 
												the properties of Mr. and Mrs. 
												Cudjoe, properties valued at ¢13 
												million belonging to Mr. and 
												Mrs. Ward of House number 7/90, 
												West Anaji, Takoradi. That same 
												day the two accused robbed Mr. 
												and Mrs. Aboagye of House Number 
												PLT 48, West Anaji, of 
												properties valued at ¢5million. 
												On 17<sup>th</sup> August 2005 
												the 1<sup>st</sup> accused was 
												arrested upon a tip-off to the 
												police; the second was to suffer 
												the same fate on 24<sup>th</sup> 
												August 2005.At an identification 
												parade carried out by the 
												police, the two accused persons 
												were identified by the 
												Prosecution Witnesses to have 
												been some of the culprits of the 
												dastardly armed robbery of 27<sup>th</sup> 
												July 2005 on the 
												complainants.When arraigned 
												before the court on the charges 
												above mentioned, each accused 
												pleaded not guilty to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												However, His Lordship Mr. 
												Justice D. K. Ofosu Quartey, 
												sitting at the High Court, 
												Sekondi, tried the two accused 
												persons, found the guilt of each 
												proved beyond reasonable doubts 
												on each count and convicted them 
												accordingly; he proceeded to 
												mete out a sentence of life 
												imprisonment on each of them.&nbsp; 
												The accused were aggrieved by 
												the conviction and sentence, and 
												appealed them to the Court of 
												Appeal.The Court of Appeal 
												affirmed the conviction of each 
												appellant, but considered that, 
												much as the sentence imposed by 
												the trial judge was justified by 
												the seriousness of the offence, 
												the degree of revulsion felt by 
												law abiding citizens and the 
												impunity with which the offences 
												were committed called for severe 
												punishment to the appellants to 
												serve as a deterrent to those 
												who intended to engage in this 
												heinous crime, nonetheless, the 
												infliction of the maximum 
												sentence for armed robbery was 
												obviously on the high side. The 
												court for this reason, 
												interfered with the sentence of 
												life imprisonment by setting it 
												aside and substituting it with 
												one of 30 years imprisonment for 
												each accused.&nbsp; The accused were 
												once again aggrieved by the 
												judgment and went on a further 
												appeal to this court for the 
												purpose of quashing their 
												conviction and sentence. - <b>

                                                incident, and that they had 
                                                previously had consensual sex 
                                                twice, once in his room at the 
                                                Barracks and once at the station 
                                                view Hotel at Tudu. According to 
                                                A1, since he and A2 had been 
                                                friends for a long time, A2 also 
                                                knew about relationship with the 
                                                victim P.W1. The accused 
                                                contended that PW1 informed A1 
                                                about her pregnancy and demanded 
                                                money to abort it but he wanted 
                                                medical proof before 
                                                intervention. On the 22<sup>nd</sup> 
                                                of June 1998, the date of the 
                                                alleged incident, the 1<sup>st</sup> 
                                                accused contended that both he 
                                                and 2<sup>nd</sup> accused were 
                                                at the scene of the incident and 
                                                that he was off duty, whilst A2 
                                                was on duty. It was contended 
                                                further that P.W.1 came to 
                                                demand an amount of ¢100,000.00 
                                                (now Gh¢10.00) as the amount 
                                                spent by her on the abortion and 
                                                that his failure to pay led to 
                                                verbal insults by P.W.1 with a 
                                                threat by P.W.1 on their lives. 
                                                This incident is alleged to have 
                                                happened at about 
                                                11.00am.According to the 
                                                accused, PW1 returned later at 
                                                about 1.30pm with two other 
                                                friends and with more venom in 
                                                her, continued the verbal 
                                                assault on them and that it was 
                                                this noise which woke up PW5 
                                                Adeline Dzomeku who was asleep 
                                                in a nearby room opposite where 
                                                the rape allegedly took place. 
                                                The accused therefore denied in 
                                                its entirety the rape charge 
                                                against them. As was stated much 
                                                earlier in this judgment, 
                                                following their conviction by 
                                                the jury in the trial High Court 
                                                and sentence by the trial judge, 
                                                an appeal against both 
                                                conviction and sentence was 
                                                similarly dismissed by the Court 
                                                of Appeal, hence the instant 
                                                appeal. - </span>

												7/1/2004 acting on further 
												Intelligence information a 
												combined team of the Narcotic 
												Control Board and the Drugs Law 
												Enforcement Unit of the Police 
												Service raided the residence of

												where it discovered bails and 
												parcel of whitish substances 
												suspected to be cocaine 
												concealed in a special 
												compartment or hole in a wall 
												within the corridor upstairs 
												behind a large dressing mirror., 
												The 1<sup>st</sup> Accused 
												together with 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup> 
												and 5<sup>th</sup> Accused 
												person who were in the house at 
												the time were confronted with 
												the substances. In reaction, the 
												1<sup>st</sup> Accused said the 
												items were brought there by one 
												Yakuba for safe keeping (by the 
												1<sup>st</sup> Accused) for a 
												fee of (US$50,000.00 Dollars) 
												Fifty thousand US dollars. While 
												this was going on the 6th 
												Accused who had arrived at the 
												residence of the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Accused together with all other 
												accused persons except the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Accused person were arrested and 
												sent to Narcotic Control Board 
												Offices together with the items. 
												The items were forwarded to 
												Ghana Standards Board for 
												examination. My Lord, further 
												investigation by the Police and 
												Narcotic Control Board revealed 
												that all the accused persons 
												were engaged in criminal 
												conspiracy to commit crime 
												relating to Narcotic Drugs. At 
												the trial evidence will be led 
												to show that A4 came from Spain 
												to Ghana on 15/9/03 and on 
												17/9/2003 he together with the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Accused (A1) traveled to Brazil 
												and continued to Venezuela 
												ostensibly to procure cement for 
												prospective customers in Calabar 
												in Nigeria and Mallagu in

												lead evidence at the trial to 
												show that they did not go there

												Criminal Law - Narcotic Drugs &#8211; 
												Bail - </span></b>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is an appeal against the 
												refusal of the Court of Appeal 
												to grant an application for bail 
												to the appellants. The six 
												accused persons were arraigned 
												before the Greater Accra 
												Regional Tribunal on 28 January 
												2004 on narcotics-related 
												charges based on sections 56 
												(c), 1(1) and 2 of the Narcotic 
												Drugs (Control, Enforcement and 
												Sanctions Law), 1990 (PNDC 236). 
												The Tribunal as trial court 
												granted bail on 3rd February 
												2004 to all the accused on 
												specified conditions. The 
												Attorney-General&#8217;s Office 
												appealed against the grant of 
												bail to the Court of Appeal,&nbsp; 
												which delivered a ruling on 3<sup>rd</sup> 
												March 2004 upholding the appeal 
												and thereby rescinding the grant 
												of bail in respect of all the 
												accused. This matter came before 
												us on further appeal by all <u>
												but </u>one of the accused 
												persons, namely, the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												accused. The grounds of appeal 
												were set out in their respective 
												Notices of Appeal as follows: 
												The decision by the Court of 
												Appeal to allow the appeal 
												against the grant of bail to 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Accused/Appellant was 
												unreasonable having regard to 
												all the circumstances of the 
												case. The decision by the Court 
												of Appeal to allow the appeal 
												against the grant of bail to 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Accused/Appellant resulted in a 
												gross miscarriage of justice to 
												1<sup>st</sup> 
												Accused/Appellant, the reason 
												being that the basis of the 
												appeal before the Court of 
												Appeal and the reasons given by 
												the said Court for the 
												revocation of the bail granted 
												to 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Accused/Appellant warranted, at 
												the very least, a review of the 
												conditions upon which 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Accused/Appellant was granted 
												bail and not an outright refusal 
												of same. The Court of Appeal 
												erred in its interpretation of 
												the applicable provisions of the 
												Criminal Code 1960((Act 30) as 
												against the relevant provisions 
												of the Constitution 1992 of the 
												Republic of Ghana on the grant 
												of bail to accused persons, the 
												reason being that it downplayed 
												the constitutional provisions 
												providing for the pretrial 
												release of an accused person on 
												bail in favour of the guiding 
												(not mandatory) principles 
												governing the grant of bail as 
												contained in section 96 of Act 
												30. - <b>

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Appellant is the former 
												Minister of Youth and Sports. On 
												20th July 2001, the High Court 
												convicted him on two counts of 
												stealing and fraudulently 
												causing the financial loss of 
												$46,000.00 to the State contrary 
												to sections 124(1) and 
												179A(3)(a), respectively, of the 
												Criminal Code, 1960 (Act 29). 
												The High Court sentenced him to 
												serve 4 years in jail on each 
												count plus a fine of 
												¢10,000,000.00 or, in default, 
												12 months in jail on count two. 
												Additionally, the Appellant was 
												ordered to refund the amount of 
												$46,000.00 or, in default, serve 
												an additional jail term of 2 
												years. All the sentences were to 
												run concurrently. The Appellant 
												appealed to the Court of Appeal 
												against both the conviction and 
												the sentences. On October 23rd 
												2001, the Court of Appeal gave 
												judgment upholding the 
												conviction and, therefore, 
												dismissed the appeal. However, 
												the court varied the sentences 
												by quashing the 2 years' jail 
												sentence imposed in default of 
												making the refund ordered by the 
												High Court. The Appellant by his 
												appeal herein challenges the 
												Court of Appeal's confirmation 
												of the conviction and the 
												remaining sentences.- <b>

												- According to the Prosecution, 
												the appellants are Nigerian 
												citizens now resident in Ghana. 
												On 21<sup>st</sup> December 2000 
												they arrived in Takoradi from 
												Accra and continued to Tarkwa. 
												They arrived in Tarkwa at about 
												10:00pm where they were led by a 
												man by name C.K. to Akoon Small 
												Mining Company. Armed with a 
												single barrel shot gun, an axe, 
												a jack knife and a quantity of 
												ammunition, the appellants 
												together with certain other 
												persons attacked the security 
												officers on duty. The appellants 
												beat up these officers and 
												afterwards made away with a gold 
												weighing machine valued at ¢12 
												million (old Cedis) and a 
												quantity of gold concentrate. 
												The appellants then continued to 
												Wasa-Manso where they attacked 
												the home of a prosecution 
												witness and his family. The 
												appellants hit the witness on 
												the head and he fell down 
												unconscious. They subjected his 
												wife to severe beatings after 
												which they stole two travelling 
												bags, a mobile phone and its 
												charger, one kente cloth and a 
												sum of ¢1.1 million. The 
												appellants packed the items into 
												the man&#8217;s vehicle and fled but 
												abandoned the vehicle at a point 
												after radio announcements had 
												been made about the robbery. 
												Fortunately the appellants were 
												spotted by some town folks and 
												were chased and apprehended and 
												handed over to the police. - <b>

												The facts of the case as 
												presented by the prosecution are 
												that the accused persons are all 
												American nationals resident in 
												the United States of America.&nbsp; 
												They arrived at the Kotoka 
												International Airport to board a 
												Delta Airline flight to the 
												United States of America.While 
												going through pre-departure 
												formalities for the flight, 
												operatives of Narcotics Control 
												Board suspected them of carrying 
												narcotic drug and therefore 
												picked them for a search which 
												revealed a powdery substance 
												suspected to be narcotic drug 
												hidden in their pants and the 
												sole of their shoes.&nbsp; A further 
												search on 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> 
												accused persons revealed pellets 
												of the same powdery substance 
												hidden in their vagina.&nbsp; They 
												were therefore arrested.On 
												interrogation, they mentioned 
												one Abubakari Issaka in the 
												U.S.A. as the one who contracted 
												them for a fee to carry the 
												substance to the United States.&nbsp; 
												They named one Alhaji as their 
												contact in Ghana and that the 
												said Alhaji for whom they 
												brought four envelopes 
												containing money met them on 
												their arrival in Ghana on 
												02/09/09.&nbsp; In Ghana, Alhaji took 
												care of all their needs.&nbsp; It was 
												he who gave them the substance 
												to be carried to Abubakari in 
												America. From these facts, one 
												can safely conclude that the 
												accused persons acted together 
												with a common purpose in 
												committing the offence of 
												attempt to commit an offence of 
												exportation of narcotic drug 
												without a license issued by the 
												Minister for Health contrary to

												<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">
												The case for the prosecution was 
												that on 21 Jan 1993, the 
												deceased Amegbor Amedorme took 
												John Narteh Amergbor (PW2) to 
												Adornukedzi Island to inspect 
												some palm trees that PW2 wanted 
												to buy to distil akpeteshie. 
												They were accompanied by Andrew 
												Agormedah (PW3). They met the 
												appellant who was fishing. PW3 
												said he greeted the appellant 
												but he did not respond. On their 
												way back the deceased was in the 
												lead followed by PW2 and then 
												PW3. According to PW2, the 
												appellant emerged from the back 
												of a palm tree and slashed the 
												neck of the deceased with a 
												cutlass and he staggered and 
												fell. The appellant turned on 
												him and he parried the blow and 
												was injured on the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 
												3<sup>rd</sup>, and 4<sup>th</sup> 
												fingers. The appellant tried to 
												slash his stomach and once again 
												he tried to block the cutlass 
												and he had a cut on his right 
												forearm. PW2 and PW3 fled the 
												scene leaving the deceased 
												behind. His evidence was 
												corroborated by PW3.The case for 
												the appellant was that the land 
												belonged to his family and he 
												was on it to harvest palm fruits 
												to sell to pay his school fees. 
												His family and the deceased&#8217;s 
												family have been litigating over 
												the land. When he saw the 
												deceased and two others he asked 
												them their mission and the 
												deceased who was holding a 
												cutlass slashed him on the wrist 
												and left knee. He became furious 
												so he started brandishing the 
												cutlass he was holding and it 
												cut &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PW2 on his arm and 
												the neck of the deceased. The 
												deceased fell and the others 
												then fled and he decided to make 
												a report to the police. He saw 
												that the head of the deceased 
												was almost off so he cut it off 
												as he did not want anyone to 
												come for it in his absence. </span><b>

												The undisputed facts before the

												2002 the appellant and his three 
												accomplices armed with a gun and 
												other offensive weapons attacked 
												the residence of PW1 and PW2,

												number plate of the BMW car 
												changed from GR 2158Q to GR 
												9204Q and then drove the car to

												to the arrest of one Daniel 
												Amewu, the 3<sup>rd</sup>

												In the course of the Police

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The brief facts of the case on 
												appeal are that the plaintiff 
												obtained a customary grant of 
												the land in dispute from the 
												Manche Ankrah family sometime in 
												1962. He went into possession 
												almost immediately. Sometime in 
												1980 the defendant entered that 
												land and started putting up a 
												wooden structure. The plaintiff 
												promptly pulled down and 
												destroyed the wooden structure. 
												A complaint of this fracas was 
												made to the Ghana Police. The 
												Ghana Police did not pursue the 
												complaint and did not 
												investigate it. In the opinion 
												of the Ghana Police, the real 
												issue in dispute is the 
												ownership of the plot of land 
												therefore advised the rival 
												parties to seek redress in a 
												civil&nbsp; court. None of the 
												parties acted on the advice of 
												the Ghana Police. Sometime in 
												1981, the defendant commenced 
												building operations on the plot 
												of land. The plaintiff again 
												made a complaint of trespass 
												against the defendant. In the 
												meantime the plaintiff sued the 
												defendant in the High Court 
												Accra and claimed&nbsp; the reliefs 
												stated in the writ. The 
												defendant resisted the claim on 
												the ground that the plot of land 
												was originally allocated to his 
												mother on the occasion 30 
												members of Manche Ankrah family 
												were allocated plots of land, 
												including the plot in dispute, 
												by the Manche Ankrah family. He 
												pleaded that his mother had 
												remained in possession of the 
												plot since the said allocation. 
												In due course, one Nii Ayi 
												Ankrah applied to be joined as 
												co-defendant. He gave two main 
												reasons to support his 
												application. The first was that 
												the plot of land in dispute was 
												part of Manche Ankrah family 
												land. The other reason was that 
												the plot of land was customarily 
												granted to defendant's mother by 
												Manche Ankrah family. - <b>

												intestate on 22<sup>nd</sup> 
												May, 1987, survived by three 
												children namely the Plaintiffs 
												and their younger sister, Sheila

												to their declaration of the 
												immoveable property of Sylvia, 
												consisted, solely, of the 
												abovementioned property; it was 
												also her fixed place of abode at 
												the time of her death. After the 
												grant of the Letters of 
												Administration on 11<sup>th</sup> 
												November, 1987, Madam Wood, on 
												31<sup>st</sup> January 1989, 
												deposed to an &#8216;Affidavit as to

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Plaintiff avers that she is 
												the head of her maternal family 
												and that she brought the action 
												on behalf of her said maternal 
												family. She alleges that 
												Defendants are the children of 
												the late Kwabena Asante alias 
												Kwabena Dan, her granduncle. 
												That late Kwabena Asante was one 
												of the four children of her 
												great grand mother the late 
												Ateakosuaa, and that her family 
												lived at Old Ampabame in 
												Kumasi.It is her case that the 
												Old Ampabame Township was 
												relocated from its old site to 
												its present site, to give way to 
												the Owabi head-works. The then 
												Gold Coast Government paid a 
												compensation of £30 to each 
												household for each house lost as 
												a result of the re-location. 
												Unspecified sums of money were 
												also paid as compensation for 
												each farm lost. Plaintiff&nbsp; 
												alleges further that the late 
												Kwabena&nbsp; Asante&nbsp; received the 
												compensation paid for their 
												family house at Ampabame, as 
												well as the&nbsp; unspecified sums of 
												money paid for the&nbsp; cocoa farm 
												of the late Kojo Mosi the then 
												deceased brother of&nbsp; Kwabena&nbsp; 
												Asante. That it was those sums 
												of money received by Kwabena 
												Asante as compensation for the 
												family house and Kojo Mosi&#8217;s 
												farm that Kwabena Asante applied 
												to the building of the disputed 
												house. The defendants denied the 
												plaintiff&#8217;s capacity and her 
												claim that the house in dispute 
												is her maternal family property. 
												For their part it is their case 
												that no compensation was paid to 
												any household for any house lost 
												and that Kwabena Asante did not 
												receive any compensation on 
												behalf of the plaintiff&#8217;s 
												family, which he could have 
												applied to the building of the 
												disputed house. <b>

												award certificates and diplomas 
												based on the results of such 
												examinations. The council, 
												therefore, is the sole

												Ghana for the conduct of both

												Examinations (BECE) and Senior

												that they had been involved in 
												some examination malpractices or 
												irregularities in relation to 
												Mathematics (Core) Paper 2.&nbsp; The 
												nature of the irregularities the 
												appellants were said to have 
												indulged in was that they had 
												foreknowledge of the paper and 
												colluded among themselves in 
												solving the questions. Upon 
												receipt of the letter informing 
												him of the cancellation of the 
												results of the appellants and 
												the imposition on them of a 
												three-year ban from taking any 
												examinations under the auspices 
												of the council, the headmaster 
												of the Notre Dame School 
												petitioned the council to review 
												its decision.&nbsp; He advanced a 
												number of reasons why he felt 
												the sanctions needed a review.&nbsp; 
												The most important and relevant, 
												in my view, is his objection to 
												the procedure adopted by the 
												council in its investigations, 
												culminating in the punishment of 
												his students. He urged upon 
												the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; council 
												that the claim that the 
												appellants had foreknowledge of 
												the Mathematics (Core) Paper 2 
												is only an allegation and the 
												invocation and &#8220;application of 
												rule 56 without further 
												investigation to ascertain the 
												veracity or otherwise of the 
												allegation is a bit harsh on the 
												poor&nbsp;&nbsp;students. - <b>

												claimed that the1st respondent 
												had rendered them redundant and 
												were therefore entitled to a

												The appellant, who was employed

												illness was occupational, in

												Appeal.&nbsp; The part of the 
												judgment which provokes this 
												application directs the 
												plaintiff/applicant to demolish 
												the sand crete block security 
												fence wall which he constructed 
												around his property.It is the 
												applicant&#8217;s case that he 
												constructed the fence wall at 
												very great cost running into 
												thousands of Ghana cedis with 
												the express consent of the 
												holder of the legal title, that 
												is, the State Housing Company.&nbsp; 
												In addition he obtained a 
												building permit from the Accra 
												Metropolitan Authority.&nbsp; 
												Applicant therefore says that he 
												stands to suffer substantial 
												loss in terms of money should he 
												demolish the said fence wall 
												only to rebuild same should his 
												appeal succeed. He also contends 
												that he stands to expose himself 
												and his family to great security 
												risk of exposure to thieves as 
												he has no means to adequately 
												secure his property while the 
												appeal is pending.The 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Defendant by its Solicitor filed 
												an affidavit in opposition to 
												the instant motion on 3<sup>rd</sup> 
												May, 2011.&nbsp; The 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Defendant&#8217;s case is that the 
												Plaintiff as well as the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												to 13<sup>th</sup> Defendants 
												each paid the same amount of 
												money for their respective 
												apartments in the terrace 
												building and the communal septic 
												tank was constructed for the 
												benefit of all the occupants of 
												the terrace building with the

												However, the Plaintiff has 
												denied the other occupants 
												access to the septic tank to 
												dislodge same and has even 
												interfered with the operation of 
												same by blocking the opening 
												into the septic tank.&nbsp; So if the 
												said fenced wall is allowed to 
												stand, it will not only 
												inconvenience the other 
												occupants but it will also be a 
												continuous source of conflict at 
												the terrace building between the 
												Plaintiff on the one hand and

												he was not qualified to be so 
												elected as a Member of

												upon a true and proper

												47(1)(5)(6) and 113 of the 
												Constitution of the Republic of 
												Ghana 1992. The Electoral 
												Commission has the right to

												Presidential and Parliamentary 
												Elections contrary to the 
												position being held by the 
												National Democratic Congress (NDC) 
												and other section/sections of 
												the public do contend otherwise 
												and do support the position of 
												the Electoral Commission thereby 
												creating controversy in respect 
												of the articles 47 and 113 of

												include the thirty (30) newly 
												created constituencies in the 
												2004 General and Parliamentary 
												Elections to be held in 
												December, 2004.&quot; The Plaintiff's 
												writ was supported by a 
												Statement of Case, and the 
												written submissions of his 
												counsel. There was no affidavit 
												by the plaintiff verifying facts 
												and particulars in his statement 
												of case, as required by Rule 
												46(2) (a) of C.I. 16. And 
												although the plaintiff's action 
												is pegged on the views of the 
												Electoral Commission (EC) and 
												the NDC, neither the NDC nor the 
												EC are made parties to the 
												action, nor even served with 
												copies of the writ and the 
												supporting papers. The 
												plaintiff's action undoubtedly 
												stems from the hue and cry by 
												sections of the public in 
												reaction to the EC's decision to 
												feature the proposed 30 new 
												constituencies in the December 
												2004 Presidential and 
												Parliamentary Elections. There 
												were varied views. Some 
												contended that the newly created 
												constituencies should not 
												feature in the December 2004 
												General Elections but rather in 
												the 2008 elections. There were 
												still others who held that the 
												election of candidates to 
												represent the 30 newly created 
												constituencies in Parliament 
												should take place on 7th January 
												2005, when the alteration shall

												presented an unsigned tenancy

												caused a fetish priest to come 
												to his house at Osu and 
												threatened him, reported the 
												case to the Osu Police and the 
												latter went and arrested the 
												plaintiff at Dansoman-Agege. The 
												plaintiff was cautioned and 
												released on bail. The fetish 
												priest repeated the same threat 
												and the case was again reported 
												to the police.On 15-05-2005, the 
												police went and arrested the

												was released the following day

												&#8211; <b>Social security&nbsp; -</b> The 
												plaintiff started his employment 
												with the Ghana Commercial Bank 
												from July, 1967 which employment 
												came to an end in May, 1981. 
												Social security contributions 
												were paid for and by the 
												plaintiff to the defendant 
												pension scheme for all this 
												period which is a total of 167 
												months. From July 1996 to 
												December 2001, the plaintiff was 
												in the employment of Paramount 
												Distilleries Limited where again 
												contributions were made for and 
												by him to the defendant pension 
												scheme covering a period of 66 
												months. This brings the total 
												undisputed contributions of the 
												plaintiff to 233 months.The 
												parties, however, join issues on 
												two factual matters. The first 
												is that while the plaintiff 
												contends that at the time he 
												severed his relationship with 
												Ghana Commercial Bank the latter 
												paid him 3 months salary in lieu 
												of notice and 4 months salary 
												for his outstanding earned leave 
												and in which social security 
												contributions were duly paid. 
												The defendant flatly denies any 
												such payment. The second dispute 
												is that the plaintiff alleged 
												that he worked with Opayesco 
												Wood Processing Limited from 
												February, 1995 to December, 1995 
												and social security 
												contributions were paid for his 
												benefit covering a period of 11 
												months. The defendant denies 
												this and averred on the contrary 
												that the said company was 
												defunct within the period 
												plaintiff alleges that he was in

												through the head of family, Nii 
												Norkwei Ashong Sogbla, with the

												plaintiff its freehold interest

												situate at Haatso, Accra, The 
												plaintiff avers further that he 
												subsequently registered the 
												conveyance at the Land Registry 
												as Land Registry No. 139/1996. 
												Thereafter, he applied to the 
												Land Title Registry for a Land 
												Title Certificate covering the 
												parcel of land and obtained on 
												29-04-1996, Land Title 
												Certificate No. GA9214, in 
												respect of the parcel of land. 
												It is the case of the plaintiff 
												that, sometime in 1994, it came 
												to the notice of his caretaker 
												and now attorney, Stephen Nortey, 
												that the defendant had entered 
												upon the land and commenced 
												building construction thereon. 
												The plaintiff&#8217;s caretaker warned 
												off the defendant and his agents

												1996, the plaintiff&#8217;s caretaker 
												once more noticed that building 
												construction had resumed and 
												when he went to enquire and put 
												a halt to the construction the 
												defendant&#8217;s caretaker/watchman

												employed as a chief security 
												officer at the defendant&#8217;s 
												company. He had been discharging 
												all his duties until 21-01-2008

												bulletin by the 3<sup>rd</sup> 
												defendant, Ohenenana Kwame Amo, 
												who is the newscaster of the 
												radio station. These

												to him are libelous and untrue 
												for they sought to question his 
												moral character and professional 
												competence and lowered his 
												reputation in the estimation of 
												right thinking members of the

												the plaintiff, the next day 
												after the publications, that is 
												20-10-2009, he brought the 
												mother of the girl and the girl 
												herself to the studio of HOT FM 
												and there the girl denied that 
												she knew the plaintiff whereupon 
												the mother apologised to him and 
												pleaded with the radio station

												beneficial owners of the estate 
												of Marcus Hughes who died on the 
												17<sup>th</sup> day of April,

												Stanley Newton Acquaye in 1977

												Acquaye executed a deed of 
												conveyance which was stamped as 
												No. AC 6249/83 and given Land 
												Registry No. 3674/1983. The deed 
												of conveyance made reference to 
												the temporary receipt which was 
												stamped as No. AC 4645/77. The 
												plaintiffs further aver that 
												Marcus Hughes took possession of 
												the land, cleared the weeds and 
												erected a fence wall around the 
												land he acquired and exercised 
												rights of ownership thereon 
												without any disturbance from any

												<b>Loss of earnings</b>.- <b>
												Permanent impairment</b>.- The 
												facts culminating into the 
												instant suit are not in dispute. 
												On 08-12-2006, both parties went 
												to the Cinderella Night Club at 
												Cantonments behind the Police 
												Headquarters. While there, a 
												misunderstanding arose between 
												the defendant and his brother, 
												Alim Banda, on the one hand, and 
												one Fezal, who claims to be a 
												half brother of the defendant, 
												on the other hand. In the 
												process, the defendant threw 
												bottles, drinking glasses and 
												anything at his reach on the 
												said Fezal. One of the drinking 
												glasses that the defendant threw 
												went straight towards the 
												plaintiff. The plaintiff blocked 
												the said glass impulsively with 
												his right hand and got injured 
												in his right hand palm. He was 
												rushed to the 37 Military 
												Hospital for treatment. After an 
												initial treatment at the 37 
												Military Hospital, the plaintiff 
												was referred to the Plastic 
												Surgery Centre of the Korle-Bu 
												Teaching Hospital. He underwent 
												surgical operation and was under 
												treatment there for about three 
												weeks. Thereafter, he sought 
												permission from the surgeon and 
												travelled to South Africa to 
												visit his relatives as he had 
												already planned. In South 
												Africa, it was detected that the 
												plaintiff had an infection of 
												the wound and a doctor there 
												referred him to a specialist in 
												the United Kingdom. The 
												plaintiff thus proceeded to the 
												said specialist in London for 
												treatment. The plaintiff was 
												duly treated by the specialist 
												at the London Hand and Wrist 
												Unit. Upon his return to Ghana, 
												the plaintiff instituted the

												<span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
												The case of the plaintiffs is 
												that the so-called Will of the 
												late Jonathan Ebenezer Ayittey 
												was not duly executed in 
												accordance with the Wills Act, 
												1971 (Act 360). The plaintiff 
												contend that, at the time the 
												said Will was purportedly 
												executed, the alleged testator 
												was not of sound mind, memory or 
												understanding and did not know 
												and approve of the contents 
												thereof. The plaintiffs allege 
												that, on 10-10-1978, the alleged 
												testator was admitted to the 
												male ward of the Ridge Hospital, 
												Accra, in a very poor health. 
												The diagnosis of the physician 
												specialist who attended to him 
												disclosed that he was suffering 
												from cerebral sclerosis &#8211; a 
												disease of the brain or mind 
												which rendered him incapable of 
												conducting or controlling his 
												affairs and communicating 
												intelligently and meaningfully 
												with anyone. The plaintiffs aver 
												further that the deceased&#8217;s 
												condition continued to 
												deteriorate from 10-10-1978 
												until he was discharged from the 
												hospital on 31-10-1978 at the 
												request of the head of family to 
												be taken to Obrachire, The 
												plaintiffs contend that the 
												deceased was transferred from 
												the general male ward to the 
												V.I.P. ward on 20-10-1978 at the 
												instance of the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												co-defendant for the sole 
												purpose of exerting undue 
												pressure and influence on him to 
												execute the purported Will under 
												which the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												co-defendant, who is not a son 
												of the deceased, and the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												co-defendant, who is a concubine 
												of the deceased, and her

												of Arts course. In April, 2006, 
												during the second semester

												to just occupy any empty desk at

												she did. With about 30 minutes

												witnessed a spectacle of 
												confrontation between the

												of her. The invigilator 
												repeatedly questioned him where

												in the same month of January, 
												2010, wrote to him suspending 
												him from all ministerial duties, 
												including duties as the 
												Administrative Bishop. 
												Subsequently, the Disciplinary

												took a decision to recommend to 
												the Conference of the church 
												through the Synod and General 
												Purposes Council of the Church 
												in their Ministerial Session,

												Council failed to follow the

												Presiding Bishop. By then, the

												Jurisdiction - Out of time &#8211; 
												Nullity - </span></b>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is an application for an 
												order of certiorari directed to 
												the High Court, Accra presided 
												over by Nana Gyamera-Tawiah, J, 
												to quash its judgment given on 
												29th January, 2001 in the suit 
												entitled Jupiter Airlines vrs. 
												Continental Cargo and Trade 
												Service Inc., Suit No. MISC 
												258/2000.The only ground for the 
												application is that the judgment 
												is null and void because the 
												court lacked jurisdiction in the 
												suit the subject matter of this 
												application. The main reason for 
												this contention is that both the 
												Plaintiff and the Defendant in 
												the suit sought to be quashed 
												were outside the jurisdiction of 
												the court and the alleged 
												contract for sale as well as the 
												subject matter of the sale, an 
												aeroplane, also were all outside 
												the jurisdiction and had no 
												connection with Ghana.The 
												interested party has raised a 
												preliminary objection to the 
												application. His reason is that 
												the application is woefully out 
												of time: the judgment sought to 
												be quashed was delivered on 29th 
												January, 2001; and the instant 
												application was filed on 15th 
												May, 2002, some 15 months 
												later.&nbsp; Rule 62 of the Supreme 
												Court Rules, C.I. 16, requires 
												that an application to invoke 
												the supervisory jurisdiction of 
												the court must be filed within 
												90 days of the date of the 
												decision sought to be 
												quashed.The applicant&#8217;s answer 
												to the preliminary objection is 
												that since the decision of the 
												High Court was a nullity it can 
												be set aside at any time.In 
												applications for an order of 
												certiorari lawyers for 
												applicants are fond of 
												saying,&#8220;Where an act is void, 
												then it is in law a nullity. It 
												is not only bad but incurably 
												bad. There is no need for an 
												order of the court to set it 
												aside. It is automatically null 
												and void without more ado, 
												though it is sometimes 
												convenient to have the court 
												declare it to be so. And every 
												proceeding which is founded on 
												it is also bad and incurably 
												bad. You cannot put something on 
												nothing and expect it to be stay 
												there. It will collapse&#8221; - <b>

												&nbsp;Land&nbsp; -&nbsp; Recovery of

												injunction.- </span></b>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The background to this appeal is 
												that, the appellant, on his own 
												behalf and as the Head of the 
												Aburadze family of Gwira 
												Akyinimu, claimed against the 
												respondent for declaration of 
												title to two pieces of land 
												known as Gwira Akyinimu, in the 
												Edina Traditional Area, and 
												orders for recovery of 
												possession and perpetual 
												injunction.The appellant's case 
												was to the effect, that the 
												disputed lands were originally 
												broken and settled by his 
												ancestor Kwesi Gwira, the first 
												Odikro, who had been accompanied 
												by his sister, Tseasewa. In the 
												course of time, according to the 
												appellant, a member of the 
												defendant's family married the 
												niece of the Odikro and, as a 
												result of the marriage, Gwira 
												promised that farming land would 
												be made available to members of 
												the respondent's family who 
												wished to farm, and this became 
												an established practice. Also, 
												according to the appellant, when 
												the respondent himself needed 
												land for a salt industry, he had 
												approached Nana Gwira III and 
												requested an allocation, which 
												request had been granted after 
												the&nbsp; performance of custom. 
												However, the respondent had, 
												without the consent of the 
												Odikro, attempted to extend the 
												area of his allocation, and, 
												moreover, had been claiming 
												ownership of the entire land and 
												purporting to sell portions 
												thereof, thereby precipitating 
												the suit. For his part, the 
												respondent, asserted that the 
												lands were the family's 
												ancestral property and that, 
												therefore, he needed no 
												permission or consent from the 
												appellant to alienate any part. 
												The respondent also claimed that

												the accompanying statement of 
												claim, the plaintiff avers that 
												he is the owner in possession of 
												the land in issue having 
												purchased same in 1976 for 
												¢2,000.00 (old currency). 
												Sometime in 2007, the Catholic 
												Church expressed a desire to 
												develop a portion of the said 
												land as a nucleus of tertiary 
												educational institution having 
												already approached the 
												plaintiff. The plaintiff agreed 
												to let out to the church 20 
												acres of the said land. The 
												plaintiff, acting by one Mr. 
												Reynolds, his surveyor as the 
												original surveyor who demarcated 
												the said land at the time of 
												purchase and a representative of 
												the Catholic Church, were 
												instructed by the plaintiff to 
												enter onto the said land and 
												select an area suitable for the 
												purposes of the church, survey 
												and demarcate the area for the 
												said purpose.<b> </b>The 
												plaintiff avers further that 
												when his representatives got to 
												Ashalaja on 19-02-2009, they 
												went to the defendant&#8217;s stool 
												family house and as a matter of 
												courtesy, they informed the 
												defendant and his elders of 
												their mission intending then to 
												go and work on the said land. 
												The defendant menacingly 
												informed the plaintiff&#8217;s survey 
												team that the plaintiff had no 
												land on any part of Ashalaja&#8217;s 
												land and that if the team 
												insisted on entering the forest 
												to do the demarcating, they will 
												be doing so at their own risk. 
												The defendant also told the team 
												among other things that he had 
												been informed by his 
												predecessor-in-title that there 
												was no such grant and that the 
												only thing that existed between 
												the stool of Ashalaja and the 
												plaintiff was that there was 
												only a promise to make a grant 
												to the plaintiff if and when he 
												represented them in court 
												proceeding which is false and 
												only meant to frighten and put 
												off the plaintiff from entering 
												onto his said land.<b> </b>The 
												plaintiff thus contends that the 
												defendant&#8217;s conduct and menacing 
												utterances on the date 
												above-mentioned has led the 
												plaintiff in no doubt that the 
												defendant is staking a claim to 
												the plaintiff&#8217;s land. Thus, the 
												plaintiff&#8217;s instant action -

												- The plaintiffs desirous of 
												putting up residential dwellings 
												severally negotiated the 
												purchase from the James Town 
												Stool, Accra of various plots of 
												land within an area called 
												Dunkonaa in the Greater Accra 
												Region.&nbsp; The negotiations and 
												purchase of the said plots 
												according to the pleadings filed 
												on their behalf took place on 
												different dates between 1990 to 
												2004. The defendant corporation 
												was in or about the year 1996 
												allocated portions of land that 
												had been previously acquired by 
												the government The said 
												acquisition was made primarily 
												for the benefit of members of 
												Ghana Real Estate Development 
												Association (GREDA) but when 
												they were unable to meet the 
												requirements of the grant to 
												them the government allocated 
												507.75 acres out of the 586.25 
												acres of the land compulsorily 
												acquiredto the defendant. The 
												allocation to the defendant was 
												by means of a lease commencing 
												from 1 November 1996 for a term 
												of 99 years.&nbsp;As a result of the 
												grant of the leasehold to the 
												defendant by the Lands 
												Commission, the defendant was 
												obliged to pay compensation to 
												the previous owners, the James 
												Town Stool. In the course of its 
												entry on the land, the defendant 
												noticed several acts of 
												encroachment in the form of 
												building works on the land. The 
												defendant caused notices to be 
												served on the developers and 
												when the matter could not be 
												peaceably resolved, it caused 
												the buildings on the land to be 
												demolished. The plaintiffs 
												claiming to be the owners of the 
												properties demolished took out 
												the action herein claiming 
												general and special damages and 
												a declaration that the defendant 
												in utilising the area allocated 
												to it had exceeded same by 43.30 
												acres as well as an order of

												The case of the Plaintiff as 
												narrated by his Attorney was 
												quite simple. The Plaintiff is a 
												businessman and an Islamic 
												Religious leader. By a deed of 
												conveyance dated March 23, 1990 
												between the Plaintiff on one 
												part and Nii Kpakpo Amako II 
												Mankralo and Acting Sempe Mantse 
												of Accra, acting with the 
												consent and concurrence of the 
												principal members of the said 
												family of the other part, Nii 
												Kpakpo Amako, as the Acting 
												Sempe Mantse, leased a parcel of 
												land situate at Sowutuom,. 
												According to the Plaintiff, 
												sometime in 1999 he entered into 
												an oral tenancy agreement with 
												the Defendant through his 
												caretaker to the effect that the 
												Defendant would operate a 
												temporary hand-pump fuel filling 
												station on the said plot of land 
												until the Plaintiff required it 
												for his own use. The Defendant, 
												acting under the terms of this 
												agreement made payment of the 
												first year&#8217;s rent advance. The 
												Plaintiff applied this money to 
												erect a temporary structure on 
												the said land for use by the 
												Defendant as an office and a 
												storeroom. Subsequently, the 
												Defendant commenced the building 
												of additional and permanent 
												structures on the land. 
												Defendant also refused to pay 
												the rent for the period January 
												to December 2000 and January to 
												December 2001, The Defendant on 
												his part contends in relation to 
												the land in dispute that the so 
												called lessors of the Plaintiff 
												are not the rightful owners of 
												the said land. He denied that he 
												had ever been a tenant of the 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s. In defence to the 
												action brought against him by 
												the Plaintiff, the Defendant 
												contended that in 1997, he was 
												granted a piece of land by 
												Colonel John Tetteh Odoi 
												Addy(Rtd), head of the Abola 
												Piem (Tunma We) Family who are 
												the lawful and rightful owners 
												of the land in dispute.- </span>

												<span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
												The case of the plaintiff is 
												that her family inherited the 
												land described above from one 
												Madam Fofo Ashong (deceased) who 
												was the owner in possession by 
												virtue of a Deed of Gift dated 
												04-04-1949 made between Nii 
												Kwabena Bonne III, the Osu Alata 
												Manche, as the grantor on the 
												one hand and Madam Fofo Ashong 
												as the grantee on the other hand 
												which Deed of Gift was 
												registered at the Land Registry 
												as No. 1266/77.The plaintiff&#8217;s 
												family has been in undisturbed 
												possession of this land until 
												the year 2000 when the 
												Archbishop of the&nbsp; Accra Diocese 
												(the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant) 
												entered the said land and 
												erected a fence wall around it 
												in preparation of carrying out 
												constructional work thereon. As 
												a result, the plaintiff&#8217;s family 
												reported the matter to the 
												current Osu Alata Manche, Nii 
												Kwabena Bonne IV who tried 
												unsuccessfully to resolve the 
												issue. The case of the 
												defendants is that they acquired 
												the land in dispute separately 
												from two persons namely Adueley 
												Hammond and Ann Lutterodt by 
												Deeds of Gift dated 13-05-1999. 
												Their grantors similarly 
												acquired their grants separately 
												from Nii Okwei Omaboe by Deeds 
												of Gift dated 05-12-1952. Their 
												grantors after their 
												acquisitions had been in 
												possession since 1952 till they 
												granted same to the defendant in 
												1999. It was in 2000 that the 
												plaintiffs began to lay adverse 
												claim to the said land. 
												According to the defendants, 
												they conducted various searches 
												at the Lands Commission and the 
												results confirmed their title. 
												They, therefore, registered 
												their documents at the Land 
												Registry. Subsequent searches 
												after registration revealed that 
												they are the only people who 
												acquired the land in dispute. -

												near Abokobi and the lawful

												Plaintiff alleges further that 
												the Defents/Respondents/Respondents 
												(hereinafter referred to as

												Abladzei another village also 
												near Abokobi and about three

												predecessors leave and licence 
												to farm on the Northeastern 
												portion of Boi land, which 
												licence the Defendants were 
												enjoying.<b> </b>It is 
												contention of the Plaintiff 
												that, notwithstanding as 
												aforesaid, recently Defendants 
												started alleging title to the 
												land on which they were granted 
												leave to farm and have even 
												extended their claim to a 
												greater portion of Boi land. The 
												plaintiff maintains that the 
												Defendants&#8217; conduct constitutes

												and consequently warned them off 
												but they persist in their act of 
												trespass. Later

												elaborate Statements of Defence, 
												Defendant and Co-Defendant deny 
												the Plaintiffs claim. They 
												maintain that the land in

												Lomotey family of which the

												land was a subject of a 
												customary grant made to their

                                                The claim of the plaintiffs is 
                                                based on the simple ground, that 
                                                the land was acquired by their 
                                                grandfather in or about 1911.&nbsp; 
                                                The said grandfather whose name 
                                                was not pleaded enjoyed the use

                                                the father of the plaintiffs&#8217;.&nbsp; 
                                                It was after the death of the 
                                                plaintiff&#8217;s father that the 
                                                property passed to the 
                                                plaintiffs&#8217; as successors.&nbsp; It 
                                                was part of the pleadings and 
                                                evidence that the statutory 
                                                declaration covering the land 
                                                was used to procure a Land Title

                                                The cause of action against the 
                                                defendants is that the 
                                                defendants had broken the wall 
                                                on part of the land which serves 
                                                as the boundary between the 
                                                defendants&#8217; 
                                                predecessors-in-title&#8217;s land and 
                                                that of the plaintiffs. The 
                                                defendant controverted most of 
                                                the allegations of facts pleaded 
                                                but it appears that when the 
                                                evidence was led it became clear 
                                                that the defendants acquired 
                                                their land from one Mr. Yawson 
                                                who inherited the land from his 
                                                father.&nbsp; After the death of the 
                                                first defendant&#8217;s father, the 
                                                property passed on to the first 
                                                defendant.&nbsp; A vesting asset was 
                                                prepared after the 
                                                administrators had applied for 
                                                and obtained letters of 
                                                administration for the property 
                                                to be vested in the first 
                                                defendant who sold the property 
                                                to the second defendant.&nbsp; In the 
                                                course of his evidence, the 
                                                second defendant claimed that 
                                                the property was acquired in the 
                                                name of his firm for a

                                                for a further order for 
                                                cancellation of the Land Title 
                                                Certificate granted to the 
                                                plaintiffs, on grounds of fraud.

												&nbsp;The applicant&#8217;s case is that 
												during the pendency of the 
												appeal before this court he 
												stumbled upon a map from the 
												room of a deceased elder of his 
												stool. (Exhibit NAP) is a 
												photocopy of the map. By his 
												affidavit he states that an 
												enquiry at Manhyia Palace 
												discovered a similar map 
												(Exhibit NAP II) and that an 
												inquiry disclosed that the map 
												was used in the determination of 
												the 1927 case which both parties 
												accept as having determined 
												their boundary. The issue arises 
												that if the map was used in the 
												determination of the 1927 case, 
												why does it continue to be 
												relevant. Surely what is 
												relevant is the 1927 judgment 
												and not the map put in evidence 
												before it. In any case, the 
												respondent denies that any map 
												was used in the 1927 case. 
												Before this Court, counsel for 
												the applicant has admitted that 
												the map was not used at the 
												trial Native Tribunal but rather 
												on appeal. - <b><u>

												<span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
												The case of the Appellant is 
												that she is the widow of one Mr. 
												Samuel Kwame Kyei who, she 
												contends, is the beneficial 
												owner of house number 461, 
												Kwadaso Estate, Kumasi. 
												According to her, she and her 
												children (together with her 
												husband before his death) had 
												been in undisturbed possession 
												of H/No. 461, Kwadaso Estate, 
												Kumasi, the subject matter in 
												dispute herein, for twenty years 
												prior to the commencement of the 
												action. However, sometime after 
												the death of her husband, the 
												Respondent succeeded in throwing 
												her (the Appellant) and her 
												children out of the house, in 
												the process of which some of her 
												personal effects were even 
												damaged. The Appellant further 
												alleged that her late husband 
												who was a junior member of the 
												Ghana Army and functioning as a 
												security personnel was on 
												friendly terms with the 
												Respondent (at the material 
												time, the Regional Secretary for 
												Ashanti Region) and intimated to 
												him, his desire to purchase a 
												house in Atonso. According to 
												the Appellant, the Respondent, 
												who held the rank of Commander, 
												and was thus a senior member of 
												the army, advised her late 
												husband that Atonso was not a 
												good neighbourhood and that he 
												(the Respondent) would rather 
												help him purchase a house in 
												Kwadaso. The Appellant contended 
												by her statement of claim that, 
												accordingly, her late husband 
												advanced an amount of ¢25,000.00 
												(old currency) (¢20,000.00 
												according to her testimony) to 
												the Respondent to enable him 
												purchase the house on behalf of 
												her late husband. The Appellant 
												explained that her husband, as a 
												&nbsp;junior member of the army, 
												could not make the purchase 
												himself, in view of the location 
												of the house being purchased. 
												Hence, the 3<sup>rd</sup> 
												Respondent, being a senior 
												officer, made the purchase on 
												his behalf. However, the 
												Appellant, whether in her 
												statement of claim or her 
												evidence at the trial (or 
												elsewhere), never explained how 
												the rest of the alleged purchase 
												money for the house was paid.-

												purported to be the owner of the 
												house sold it to the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Defendant and purported to eject

												of the long period of about 34 
												years possession and 
												improvements on the house by the 
												Plaintiffs without challenge 
												from anybody, the Defendants 
												claim to the house is statute 
												barred. The Defendants denied

												That it was acquired by the 1<sup>st</sup>

												Osu identified in this 
												proceedings as H/No. F571/1, Osu

												the two daughters of the said 
												Jacob Michael Wilson. These

												Joana Wilson and Dora Wilson. 
												The plaintiffs contend that the

												Wilson and the said daughters 
												having died intestate, the 
												property has devolved on them as 
												children of the daughters of

												There is no doubt that the

												Sowah Din family of Teshie and 
												Nmai Dzorn, Accra. Indeed both 
												parties concede that&nbsp; Okpelor 
												Sowah Din family owns a large 
												tract of land in Nmai Dzorn and 
												the disputed portion in this 
												case constitutes only two plots 
												of the said land.&nbsp; The law is 
												settled that it is the head of 
												family acting in concert with 
												principal elders/members who 
												have the legitimacy and the 
												legal capacity to alienate or 
												otherwise dispose or sell family 
												land. Accordingly, plaintiff 
												obtained a grant of the disputed 
												two plots from the then head of 
												the Okpelor Sowah Din family, 
												Eugene Odametey Sowah in 1999 
												and this grant was subsequently 
												evidenced in writing per a 
												document dated&nbsp; 30<sup>th</sup> 
												January 2000. &nbsp; It appears that 
												somewhere along the line, in the 
												year 2002, due to internal 
												wranglings in the Okpelor Sowah 
												Din family coupled with perhaps 
												the fact that the health of 
												Eugene Odametey Sowah was 
												gravely failing, the elders of

												- The gist of the Plaintiff&#8217;s 
												case as gleaned from his 
												Statement of Claim is that his 
												late father Nuumo Nai Alemonai 
												purchased the land described in 
												his Writ of Surmons from Nii 
												Adjei Komey Okpoti and Atofoatse 
												Tetteh Nukpa &#8211; joint Heads of 
												the Agbawe Family of Fafraha, 
												and was issued with a Deed of 
												Purchase dated 16<sup>th</sup> 
												August, 1978 and was registered 
												with Land Registry as Number 
												3315/1979.&nbsp; That he Plaintiff&#8217;s 
												father enjoyed a quiet and 
												undisturbed possession of the 
												land till his death in 1995 
												after which the Plaintiff and 
												his siblings also assumed 
												control and ownership of the 
												said land till few weeks before 
												the issuance of this writ. The 
												complaint against the Defendant 
												is that about four weeks to the 
												issuance of the writ, he caused 
												workers to weed a portion of the 
												land for the purposes of 
												commencing constructional works 
												on it.&nbsp; The Defendant denied the 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s claim and stated 
												that he acquired his land from 
												the true owners, and had had his 
												title Deed registered as Number 
												14/2006.&nbsp; The Defendant pleaded 
												further that the land claimed by 
												the Plaintiff is enterely 
												different from the land in his 
												possession, and that the 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s father, his siblings 
												and himself have not been in 
												possession and control of the 
												land that he claims.In reply to 
												the Defendant&#8217;s defence and 
												Counter-Claim, the Plaintiff 
												denied that the land claimed by 
												him is different from the land 
												that the Defendant claims, and 
												that the Defendant has not

												This case presents, for

												some interesting legal issues 
												relating to judicial review of 
												lower courts by the High Court.&nbsp; 
												The material facts of the case 
												were briefly as follows:&nbsp; a son 
												brought action against his 
												mother and sisters over land 
												situated near Accra, claiming 
												damages for trespass and a 
												perpetual injunction restraining 
												the defendants from interfering 
												with the land in dispute.&nbsp; He 
												succeeded and on 24<sup>th</sup> 
												September 2003 the Circuit Court 
												in Accra gave judgment in his 
												favour.&nbsp; The defendants then 
												applied to the High Court for 
												leave to apply for an order of
												<i>certiorari</i> under the old 
												High Court Rules (that is, the 
												High Court (Civil Procedure) 
												Rules, 1954 (LN 140A).&nbsp; Leave 
												was granted and their 
												application for <i>certiorari</i> 
												was granted by the High Court 
												presided over by Her Lordship 
												Ashong-Yakubu J.&nbsp; The learned 
												High Court judge held in her 
												ruling that the trial Circuit 
												Court had based its judgment 
												primarily on a legal document of 
												title which was defective since 
												it purported to dispose of Stool 
												land but did not have the prior 
												concurrence of the Minister, in 
												breach of the Administration of 
												Lands Act (Act 123).&nbsp; She 
												therefore set aside the document 
												of title as void and, along with 
												it, the judgment of the Circuit 
												Court and all the proceedings 
												before that court.-

												- Sometime in 1999 the plaintiff 
												had a friend called Stephen who 
												asked him to buy land for him. 
												So plaintiff gave money to 
												Stephen and Stephen bought the 
												land for him. Plaintiff works at 
												Cape-Coast and Stephen is in 
												Accra. The land Stephen bought 
												for plaintiff is at Afariwa 
												Estate in Oyarifa. Stephen 
												bought the land from one Shasha 
												Yemoh, an agent of the elders of 
												Oyarifa, the owners of the land 
												. I do not know the name of the 
												family of which Shasha Yemoh 
												acted as an agent. After paying 
												for the land, he was issued with 
												a document and he went to the 
												Lands Department to register it. 
												After the registration, 
												plaintiff started developing the 
												land. He made the footings up to 
												the foundation level and left it 
												for some time. Since he was 
												working in Cape-Coast he could 
												not come to Accra every day to 
												supervise the work. So he asked 
												Stephen to supervise the work 
												for him. Stephen did it up to 
												the slab level and since money 
												was not forthcoming he had to 
												stop for sometime. Upon purchase 
												of the land, plaintiff was 
												issued with a site plan that 
												shows the dimension of the land 
												purchased. And Stephen erected 
												corner pillars on the land. When 
												the land was first entered there 
												was no evidence of prior 
												occupation. Few years later 
												plaintiff came to Accra and went 
												to the site to check what he had 
												done with the intention of 
												continuation. When he went there 
												he saw some people on the site 
												digging through his foundation. 
												He asked them to stop and asked 
												them who gave them the authority 
												to work on the land. They 
												actually did not mind him. 
												Plaintiff reported the matter to 
												Adenta police. Police came to

												&nbsp;therefore that in that suit 
												Amanfu Weku family contested the 
												title to the said land with 
												Quist family.&nbsp; In the course of 
												proceedings in that case, Atta 
												Ashie Nikoi passed away and as a 
												result&nbsp; Christian Nortey Quaye 
												was substituted as head of the 
												Amanfu Weku family. It so 
												happened that the plaintiffs in 
												that case, the Amanfu Weku 
												family failed to prosecute their 
												case. Consequently His Lordship 
												E. F. Dzakpasu J. dismissed the 
												plaintiffs&#8217; case for want of 
												prosecution upon an application 
												to that effect.In view of the 
												fact that defendants, the Quist 
												family, had a counterclaim, 
												evidence was adduced in proof of 
												the counterclaim. Whereupon, 
												judgment was entered in favour 
												of defendants, the Quist family, 
												for declaration of title to the 
												disputed land.-<a style="color: blue; text-underline: single; text-decoration: none" href="../FAST%20AUTOMATED%20COURT/land%20HC/CHRISTIAN%20NORTEY%20QUAYE  %20VRS%20%20CHARLES%20QUIST,%20LAWRENCE%20QUIST.htm">

												began the excavation for a

												compound but in the middle of 
												the renovation, he was stopped

												it was after the funeral of the

												plaintiff entered into a formal 
												lease with the defendant. 
												Thereafter, Unique Financial 
												Services Ltd also stopped the 
												defendant from working on the 
												building. Defendant says it was 
												agreed that a new agreement is 
												to be prepared by the plaintiff. 
												The defendant entered appearance 
												and filed a defence and counter- 
												claim on 4-6-2008 but was 
												subsequently amended and filed 
												amended defence on 11-11-2008. 
												In the defence, the defendant 
												admitted that the house in issue 
												has been rented to the defendant 
												company and that there is a 
												tenancy agreement dated 25<sup>th</sup> 
												August 2004. The defendant 
												however pleaded that it was

												As a result of the renovations

												trust for the family since the 
												land belonged to her father. 
												D.W.1 however, gave her father&#8217;s

												Ofori Kofi but from exhibit 2 it 
												is stated that the site Marked 
												&#8216;A&#8217; is affected by partition 
												dated 30<sup>th</sup> January, 
												1979 from S.H. Obido Ofori to 
												Elizabeth C. Yartey. This

												Elizabeth Chardey Yartey or that 
												the land never belonged to her 
												father. If S.H. Obido Ofori is 
												the father of Elizabeth C.

												The Plaintiff gave evidence that

												Oduman and was given exhibit 
												&#8216;A&#8217;.&nbsp; Exhibit &#8216;A&#8217; was executed

												with the consent and concurence 
												of some principal members of the 
												Oduman Stool.&nbsp; All the three 
												elders signed exhibit &#8216;A&#8217; as Nii 
												Odu III himself.&nbsp; By the said 
												grant made in 1998, the Oduman 
												Stool divested its interest in 
												the said land. Even though the 
												grant is in the process of being 
												registered under the Land Title 
												Registration Law 1986 (P.N.D.C.L. 
												152) as per exhibit &#8216;B&#8217;, exhibit 
												&#8216;A&#8217; is still valid.&nbsp; Since Nii 
												Odu III and his elders have 
												leased the land in dispute, the 
												new chief has no right to give 
												the same land to another person 
												without first re-entering the 
												land.&nbsp; In the cases of Cofie vrs.

												Kolete (2005-06) SC GLR 368 and 
												Brown vrs. Quarshie (2003-04) SC 
												GLR 930, it was held that once a 
												Stool&nbsp; or a person has divested 
												itself or himself of an interest 
												in land, the Stool or that 
												person cannot sell the same land 
												to another person.&nbsp; The 
												Plaintiff also gave evidence

												filed a defence, it was alleged

												of the land in dispute and that

												was a mere caretaker of the land 
												at the instance of the said

												entered into possession and

												Previously sold - </b>The 
												genesis of this appeal is that, 
												sometime in or about the year 
												2002, the Respondent, who is the 
												Pastor of a Church known as the 
												Bethel Praise Ministries 
												International, sold to the 
												Appellant a piece of land 
												situate at McCarthy Hill, Accra. 
												No formal documents were 
												executed evidencing the sale but 
												the fact of the sale is not 
												disputed by either party. The 
												Appellant made a down-payment of 
												¢120,000,000.00, in respect of 
												which the Respondent issued to 
												him a receipt dated 8<sup>th</sup> 
												January 2002. According to the 
												Appellant, very shortly after 
												making the said payment, he 
												discovered that the Respondent 
												had previously sold the same 
												piece of land to another person, 
												Construction Pioneers Company 
												Limited. He, therefore, demanded 
												a refund of the said 
												down-payment, less 
												¢20,000,000.00, which he asked 
												the Respondent to keep. The 
												Respondent having failed to make 
												the refund as demanded, the 
												Appellant, issued a writ against 
												him in the High Court (suit No. 
												C1098/02) for the recovery of 
												the said down-payment. By a 
												summary judgment entered on 21<sup>st</sup> 
												March 2003, the court found in 
												favour of the Appellant on his 
												claim and adjudged the 
												Respondent liable to him in the 
												full amount of ¢120,000,000.00 
												together with interest thereon 
												at the prevailing bank rate, 
												plus costs of ¢6,000,000.00 -

												The trial judge resolved the 
												rival claims in favour of the 
												plaintiff on the grounds <b><i>
												inter alia</i></b>, that the 
												plaintiff was a bona-fide 
												purchaser of the land without 
												notice of the fact that Nii Odai 
												Ayiku IV of Nungua the grantor 
												of his vendor had been, prior to 
												his vendor's &nbsp;purported 
												acquisition of title from him, 
												destooled.&nbsp; As to a judgment 
												affecting the land by an Accra 
												Circuit Court the trial judge 
												held that it is a settled 
												principle that a purchaser of 
												land is not estopped or affected 
												by a judgment adverse to his 
												vendor in proceedings commenced 
												subsequent to the acquisition of 
												his title.&nbsp; The trial judge also 
												held that if the co-defendant 
												had made the proper search at 
												the proper place he would have 
												known of the plaintiff's prior 
												title, secured by a Land title 
												Certificate, to the land and is 
												therefore bound by it. The Court 
												of Appeal reversed the trial 
												judge by a majority of 3 &#8211; 2,

												Tema Development Corporation, 
												hereinafter referred to as the 
												TDC. The evidence on record 
												showed that it was leased to W. 
												C. Tandoh of West Coast Dying 
												Industries Ltd. He rented it to 
												the respondent who shall 
												hereafter be referred to as the 
												plaintiff. He later sold his 
												interest in the land to the 
												plaintiff. The plaintiff then 
												proceeded to register it at the 
												Lands Commission. The interest 
												of Tandoh dated from 1<sup>st</sup> 
												August 1974. Therefore, his 
												interest which he sold to the 
												plaintiff was dated from the 
												same 1<sup>st</sup> August 1974. 
												The land sold to the plaintiff 
												consisted of three plots which 
												were numbered as LI 1, 2 and 3. 
												The plaintiff put up factories 
												on two plots, leaving the third 
												plot for future development. The 
												plaintiff later observed that 
												there were encroachments on his 
												land which he traced to the 
												appellants, who shall hereafter 
												be referred to as the 
												defendants. In fact the 
												defendants were constructing a 
												fence wall on the third plot. 
												When he did not succeed in 
												getting them to stop the 
												encroachments, he instituted 
												action in the Tema Circuit Court 
												claiming declaration of title to 
												the land and perpetual 
												injunction against the 
												defendants or their agents. <b>

												main issue which the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent/Appellant 
												(hereinafter referred to as the 
												Plaintiff) considers as his core 
												issue to be determined by this 
												court is-whether the 
												Counterclaim of the 
												Defendant/Appellant/Respondent 
												(hereinafter referred to as the 
												Defendant) is statute barred.On 
												5th February 1999, the plaintiff 
												filed this action at the High 
												Court Accra,:­The trial court 
												after a full trial and having 
												carefully weighted all the 
												evidence contained in the 
												various exhibits tendered in the 
												case before it, had no problem 
												decreeing title in the 
												defendant's family. In doing so, 
												the trial judge held thus:­&quot; 
												This right of the Baako family 
												as against the Ablorh Mills 
												family over Sabon Zongo land 
												dates back to 1909 when the said 
												lands were granted to the Baako 
												family as a settlement for the 
												Hausa community, with the 
												knowledge and consent of the 
												Ablorh Mills family who are the 
												grantors of Plaintiff's father. 
												Exhibit 4, which is a 1912 
												judgment of the then chief 
												Justice, Sir Philip Crampton 
												Smyly and the other judgments of 
												the Superior Courts tendered as 
												Exhibits SA, sB and sC attest to 
												this.father as they did in 1960, 
												thus making the grant and the 
												corresponding registration of 
												same in 1972 null and void.&quot;This 
												notwithstanding, the trial judge 
												went ahead to grant the 
												plaintiff the reliefs he was 
												seeking. It was the opinion of 
												the trial judge that the 
												Defendant's family had slept on 
												its rights for more than the 
												statutory period. The trial 
												judge computed that the 
												plaintiff's family had been in 
												adverse possession for more than 
												30years, before the Defendant 
												filed his counterclaim. Thus on 
												the application of the 
												Limitation Decree 1972 NRCD, 54, 
												the counterclaim was declared by 
												the trial judge to be statute 
												barred and under sub-section (6) 
												of Section 10 of the Decree, the 
												title of the Defendant's family 
												became extinguished.The trial 
												court decreed title in favour of 
												the defendant's family. This 
												never worried the plaintiff. He 
												found nothing wrong with the 
												evidence forming the basis of 
												the trial court's said finding.-

                                                happened to be her husband, to

                                                Her instructions were carried 
                                                out by her lawyer. Thereafter it 
                                                came to the notice of the 
                                                appellant that one Dr. Ahadzi

                                                1751/1957. Apparently fearing

                                                1750/1957 would be jeopardised 
                                                Mrs. Welbeck, whom the appellant 
                                                described as beneficiary, asked 
                                                for the purchase price of that 
                                                plot to be refunded to her. With 
                                                the support of her husband, Mrs. 
                                                Welbeck persisted in her demand 
                                                for the refund of the purchase 
                                                price in respect of plot number 
                                                1750/1957 to her. Eventually 
                                                Betty Lokko refunded an amount 
                                                of ¢6,000,000 by cheque dated 30<sup>th</sup>

												The Appellant is a missionary of 
												Korean nationality and was at 
												all material times resident in 
												the Tema Metropolitan area. The 
												1<sup>st</sup> Respondent is the 
												Pastor of the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Respondent, a church located in 
												Tema. According to the 
												Respondents, the Appellant 
												promised to raise funds for the 
												2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent whilst 
												on a projected trip to Korea. 
												Prior to his departure, the 
												Appellant, with the members of 
												the church as participants, 
												produced a video film, which 
												depicted members of the church 
												living in the Ashaiman Community 
												in abject poverty and 
												degradation. The purpose of the 
												video was to curry the sympathy 
												of prospective Korean 
												benefactors and foster their 
												generosity. Upon his return from 
												his Korean trip, the Appellant 
												made an open declaration to the 
												church that the said funds had 
												been so raised from a benefactor 
												The Appellant, however, did not 
												disclose the quantum of the 
												monies he had collected; nor did 
												he hand over any such fund to 
												the respondent church, but 
												retained the same in his own 
												bank account. He then used part 
												of it to acquire the land in 
												dispute herein. Subsequently, 
												the pastor of the church, Ben 
												Adjei, together with the church, 
												acting by its trustees, sued the 
												Appellant in the Circuit Court 
												for a declaration of title to 
												the land in dispute, recovery of 
												possession, perpetual 
												injunction, an order for 
												accounts and other orders. The 
												Circuit Court granted to the 
												Respondents the reliefs claimed, 
												except the one for accounts. The 
												Appellant, thereupon, appealed 
												to the Court of Appeal upon the 
												sole ground that the judgement 
												was against the weight of the 
												evidence. The Court of Appeal 
												affirmed the decision of the 
												Circuit Court, </span>

												<b>Pension Scheme.</b> - The

												establish the Ghana Commercial 
												Bank. At the commencement of the 
												suit before the High Court in 
												January 1995 it had about 770 
												members but as at January 2002, 
												when the instant application was 
												brought, about 89 of them had 
												died, remaining 681. In 1976 a 
												scheme was introduced by the 
												bank known as the Ghana 
												Commercial Bank Special Pension 
												Scheme. The objects of the 
												scheme included the following: 
												To serve and reward for long 
												service and devotion to duty;To 
												provide employees with 
												satisfaction that they need not 
												have financial worries because 
												of age or infirmity.The 
												Directors of the Bank for the 
												time being were the Trustees of 
												the scheme which came into 
												operation on 1st October 1976.At 
												its meeting held on 27th 
												February 1987 the Board of 
												Trustees approved a proposal for 
												the revision of the pension 
												scheme as presented to it in a 
												Memo dated 13th February, 1987. 
												The proposal which was approved 
												was in these terms:In October 
												1986.....the Government approved 
												new pensions for the Civil 
												Service based on 70% of the 
												existing salary of the goods on 
												retirement. The Board of 
												Trustees of Ghana Commercial 
												Bank Special Staff Pension 
												Scheme at a meeting held on 17th 
												December, 1986, agreed that 
												proportionate adjustments should 
												be effected to the Bank's 
												pensions based on current basic 
												salaries with effect from 
												October, 1986. It was also 
												agreed to recommend automatic 
												adjustments of pensions whenever 
												salaries change.&quot;Following 
												disputes between the Association 
												and the Bank over the Bank's 
												obligations under the scheme the 
												Association (Plaintiffs) brought 
												on action on 23rd January 1995

												The facts in this case are 
												fairly simple and admit of 
												little controversy. At the High 
												Court the plaintiff/appellant 
												(hereafter appellant) issued a 
												writ claiming: &#8220;A declaration of 
												title to all that piece or 
												parcel of land more particularly 
												described in the statement of 
												claim Recovery of possession, 
												Perpetual injunction And general 
												damages&#8221; The appellant&#8217;s claim 
												to title on the land was 
												premised on the fact that he 
												obtained his title under a grant 
												from the Oshilanaa quarter of 
												Labadi. The transaction was duly 
												recorded and registered in the 
												year 1959and he immediately 
												started exercising rights of 
												ownership over the land by 
												erecting corner pillars on the 
												land. Sometime later the 
												defendant/respondent(hereafter 
												respondent) started to interfere 
												with his quiet enjoyment of the 
												land and when respondent failed 
												to heed several warnings he 
												issued a writ at the Circuit 
												Court where he also succeeded in 
												procuring an interim order of 
												injunction. As a result of the 
												persistence of the respondent in 
												his tresspassory activities on 
												the land he issued the writ at 
												the High Court. <b>-<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="2011/MENCE%20MENSAH  %20VRS%20%20E.%20ASIAMA.htm">

												This is an appeal from the 
												decision of the Court of Appeal 
												which allowed an appeal against 
												the decision of the High Court 
												sitting at Koforidua. The facts 
												which gave rise to the 
												litigation before this court are 
												as follows: The plaintiff who 
												shall hereafter be referred to 
												as the appellant claimed that he 
												alone bought the subject matter 
												of the case which is a house 
												together with an adjoining plot, 
												both of which are situated at 
												Apedwa. He further claimed to 
												have bought it from its original 
												owner, the United African 
												Company and after the purchase 
												he permitted his late brother 
												and the brother&#8217;s family to live 
												in it. The respondent was the 
												wife of the late brother who 
												also lived in the house. It was 
												part of the case of the 
												appellant that after the death 
												of her husband the respondent 
												admitted at various meetings 
												that the property belonged to 
												the appellant. The respondent 
												denied the claims of the 
												appellant. She rather contended 
												that the property was bought 
												jointly by the appellant and her 
												deceased husband who was the 
												half brother of the appellant. 
												After the trial, the High Court 
												gave judgment for the appellant. 
												The respondent then appealed to 
												the Court of Appeal which 
												allowed the appeal and reversed 
												the judgment of the High Court. 
												Aggrieved by that decision, the 
												appellant appealed to this 
												court. - <b>

												lands of Ebiradge family of 
												Fijai, Nsona family of Anagye

												the plaintiff&#8217;s family turned 
												the site into a layout for 
												residential purposes that the 
												first defendant resisted the 
												action and made a grant of a 
												portion to the second 
												defendant.&nbsp; The plaintiff 
												further averred that his family 
												lodged a complaint with 
												Ahantahen at Busua who went into 
												the matter by way of an 
												arbitration after which the 
												first defendant was found 
												liable. In his amended statement 
												of defence the defendant&#8217;s

												that there was any proper

												purpose of the complaint was to 
												attempt an amicable settlement

												that the ownership of the land 
												had been determined in a 
												judgment delivered on 10 
												December, 1912 by His Worship 
												H.C.W. Grimshaw.&nbsp; In that case

												inaction of the head of family 
												despite repeated calls on him to

                                                successor to Kwesi Wono. When 
                                                Yaw Donkor occupied the seat as 
                                                head of the wider Akua 
                                                Anokyewaa&#8217;s family, in an

                                                listed H/NO. KO 47, Kumasi in 
                                                the inventory thereof. The 
                                                plaintiff registered his 
                                                objection through a caveat since 
                                                that house did not form part of 
                                                Kwesi Wono&#8217;s estate. Later the 
                                                result of customary arbitration 
                                                confirmed that H/NO. KO 47 did 
                                                not form part of the estate of 
                                                Kwasi Wono. When Yaw Donkor died 
                                                the defendants objected to the 
                                                plaintiff&#8217;s appointment as

                                                Eventually the plaintiff was 
                                                appointed head of Akua

                                                successor to Yaw Donkor. &nbsp;After

                                                inventory thereof. The plaintiff 
                                                entered a caveat and the result

												The facts briefly of this case 
												are that one Kofi Safo whose 
												estate is the subject-matter of 
												the action, had died on 22nd 
												April, 1998 and his wife Mrs. 
												Grace Safo, the 1st Plaintiff in 
												the action and the 1st 
												Defendant, Elvis Appiah a 
												brother of the deceased had been 
												granted Letters of 
												Administration on 12th August, 
												1998 to administer the estate of 
												the deceased. The Inventory 
												filed of the estate had included 
												House No. D.767/4 Beach Avenue 
												which the Defendants claimed 
												belonged to the 2nd 
												Defendant-Company. Though no 
												papers or documents have been 
												exhibited in this application 
												showing material particulars 
												such as the share capital or the 
												shareholding, the directors 
												(including the Managing 
												Director), the Secretary, 
												Auditor/Accountants, the balance 
												sheet showing the assets and 
												liabilities etc. etc. of the 2nd 
												Defendant Company, it appears 
												that the Company undisputably 
												had been incorporated solely by 
												the deceased as a limited 
												liability company with a share 
												Capital. The Plaintiffs claim 
												that the late Kofi Boye Safo 
												owned 100% of the shares. This 
												is however disputed by the 
												Defendants who claim that they 
												have interest in the shares and 
												that the deceased held the 
												shares in trust for them. These 
												are issues to be resolved by 
												evidence, but it is not disputed 
												by the parties that the Company 
												is a limited liability company. 
												With this disagreement between 
												the parties, concerning the 
												contents of the estate there was 
												bound to be problems and an 
												impasse in the administration of 
												the estate. It was therefore not 
												surprising that on 10th 
												December, 1998, the Plaintiffs 
												issued out a Writ of Summons -

												injunction be placed on the four 
												new electoral areas which were 
												added to Ledzokuku-Krowor 
												District.That motion was 
												granted. The result was that the 
												District Assembly and Unit 
												Committee elections were held 
												throughout the country with the 
												exception of the four electoral 
												areas added to the 
												Ledzokuku-Krowor District. The 
												reason for that ruling was 
												simply this: The target of the 
												writ was the validity of the 
												Legislative Instrument affecting 
												only Ledzokuku-Krowor District. 
												There was no basis to have held 
												up elections in the other parts 
												of the country where there was 
												no dispute affecting the

												issues relating to four

												the Petitioner married the

												accounts officer at the 
												Controller and Accountant 
												General&#8217;s Department. They both 
												did not own any properties and 
												lived in rented premises at La. 
												At the weekends, they would go 
												to Krobo to farm and plant 
												cassava. After processing the 
												harvested cassava into gari, the 
												petitioner realised 600,000 
												cedis which she used as capital 
												for trading. She traded in palm 
												oil and travelled to various 
												towns and villages to buy palm 
												oil. Aside from this, she also 
												traded in cooking oil, rice and 
												sugar from their house at La. 
												Respondent also sold some of 
												these items to his co-workers in 
												the office. She also at a point 
												in time took some money from her 
												father to reinvest in their 
												business. Gradually, they built 
												up their business and from the 
												proceeds, bought their first 
												landed property at Kasoa, on 
												which they put up a three 
												bedroom house. As the business 
												expanded, they acquired a shop 
												at the Ministries and petitioner 
												managed the shop whilst the 
												Respondent continued working at 
												the Controller and 
												Account-General&#8217;s Department. As 
												the business continued to boom, 
												the parties diversified to other 
												products, including electrical 
												appliances like fridges, TV, 
												deep freezers etc. They also 
												sold cloth, vegetable oil and 
												bicycles. The Respondent 
												arranged for these items from 
												their suppliers on credit. They 
												also got their customers from 
												the Respondent&#8217;s co-workers, 
												mostly on credit basis. This was 
												deducted at source from their 
												salaries,<b> </b>All cash which 
												was realised from sales was 
												recorded into a book by the

												sign against it. It was the

                                                company. In the course of the 
                                                trial, this letter was tendered 
                                                in evidence as Exhibit &#8216;B&#8217;.&nbsp; The

                                                for the respondent&#8217;s suspension 
                                                was that he had been implicated 
                                                in the ongoing police 
                                                investigations. The respondent 
                                                contended that the Police did 
                                                not make any adverse findings 
                                                against him and did not charge 
                                                him with any offence. It was 
                                                further contended by the

                                                did the appellant company invite 
                                                him to confront him with any 
                                                allegations of impropriety 
                                                before he was suspended. The 
                                                respondent&#8217;s Solicitor wrote to

                                                basic rules of natural justice. 
                                                The appellant justified the 
                                                decision to suspend the 
                                                respondent.Following the

												The facts that gave rise to this 
												appeal are as follows; the 
												appellant, the Ghana Commercial 
												Bank, employed the complainant 
												for some twenty-one years. In 
												1984, his appointment was 
												terminated at a time when he was 
												a manager of the bank. The 
												reason for the termination was 
												that he had contravened the 
												regulations of the bank by 
												granting a loan facility of six 
												million and seven hundred 
												thousand Cedis to a customer of 
												the bank without prior approval 
												from its head office. In 
												addition to terminating the 
												appointment, the appellant 
												withheld the entitlements of the 
												complainant until such time that 
												the customer would pay the 
												loan.&nbsp; According to the 
												complainant, he granted the 
												facility in the normal course of 
												business and after he had 
												satisfied himself of the 
												customer&#8217;s assets, the purpose 
												for the loan and the viability 
												of the customer&#8217;s business; the 
												loan was also secured with 
												assets of the customer worth 
												twenty -five million Cedis. 
												Dissatisfied with the action 
												taken against him, the 
												complainant petitioned the 
												Commissioner for Human Rights 
												and Administrative Justice for 
												redress. After investigating the 
												petition, the Commission decided 
												in favour of the complainant by 
												recommending that the appellant 
												paid the complainant some sums 
												of money. The appellant failed 
												to comply with the 
												recommendations of the 
												Commission. To enforce its 
												decision and recommendations, 
												the Commission then applied to 
												the High Court in the terms of 
												the 1992 Constitution, art. 216 
												and the Commission for Human 
												Rights and Administrative 
												Justice Act, 1993 (Act 456).- <b>

												berthed at the Shipyard and&nbsp;

												Parliamentary Candidates - Civil 
												Service</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
												- <b>Constitution</b> - The gist 
												of the Plaintiff&#8217;s case is that 
												a publication appeared in the 
												State owned newspaper &#8220;The 
												Ghanaian Times of 6th June 2000 
												at p. 10 thereof to the effect 
												that 2nd and 3rd Defendants are 
												Civil Servants working at the 
												Ministries of Finance, and Mines 
												and Energy respectively and that 
												1st Defendant is reported to 
												have decided to approve their 
												nomination as parliamentary 
												candidates in the November 2000 
												Election for the Asante Akyem 
												North and Bosomtwe 
												constituencies and that they 
												were actively campaigning as 
												such. It is to be noted that in 
												June this year the nomination 
												exercise of Parliamentary 
												candidates had not even 
												commenced. It is the case of the 
												Plaintiff, that by virtue of 
												Article 94(3)(b) a member of the 
												Civil Service is not eligible to 
												be a member of Parliament and 
												therefore the approval by the 
												1st Defendant for the future 
												nomination of the 2nd and 3rd 
												Defendants as Parliamentary 
												candidates, is a gross and 
												patent violation of the 
												Constitution in Particular 
												Article 94(3)(b) therefore and 
												is accordingly null and void and 
												of no effect. But the approval 
												to the future nomination is 
												really a mere intent and I fail 
												to see how an intention to do 
												something in the future without 
												more, can be equated to the 
												performance of an &#8220;act&#8221; which 
												could be relied on as a basis 
												for charging person with breach 
												of the constitution. Article 
												2(1)(b) requires the doing of 
												something&#8212;an &#8220;act&#8221; which is 
												inconsistent with the 
												Constitution before action can 
												be taken against the Defendant.-

												Barima by the use of a power of 
												attorney which was exhibited at 
												page fifteen of the record of 
												proceedings. That power of 
												attorney was fatally flawed for 
												two reasons. Firstly, the rule 
												as contained in Act 548, s. 1(2) 
												is that &#8220;Where the instrument is 
												signed by the author of the 
												power one witness shall be 
												present and shall attest the 
												instrument.&#8221;It is patent on the 
												instrument that no-one signed it 
												as a witness. The Court of 
												Appeal rightly rejected the 
												argument of counsel for the 
												appellant that the Commissioner 
												for Oath doubled as both the 
												witness and the person before 
												whom the power was executed. 
												There is no legal or statutory 
												basis for that argument. It 
												would be observed that the 
												provision is couched in 
												imperative terms. In so far that 
												the power of attorney in 
												question was not signed by any 
												witness, it was not valid. -<a href="2008/EDMUND%20ASANTE%20&#8211;%20APPIAH%20v%20MADAM%20KATE%20AMPONSAH%20ALIAS%20YAA%20MANSA.htm">

												that the applicant company

												favour of the respondent company 
												in January 2011.&nbsp; The respondent 
												applied to the High Court for

												parallel prayed the High Court 
												to set aside the award.&nbsp; The 
												High Court dismissed the 
												application to set aside the 
												arbitral award and rather 
												adopted the award as a judgment 
												of the Court.&nbsp; The applicant

												to the Court of Appeal and also 
												applied to the Court of Appeal 
												for a stay of execution of the 
												High Court order.&nbsp; However, the 
												applicant&#8217;s Notice of Appeal was 
												filed more than 21 days after 
												the ruling of the High Court.&nbsp; 
												Accordingly, at the hearing of 
												the applicant&#8217;s application for 
												stay of execution, the 
												respondent argued that the 
												applicant&#8217;s appeal, on which the

												On 17<sup>th</sup> January, 
												2007, the plaintiff herein 
												issued a writ against the 
												defendants for recovery of the 
												sum of GH¢72,363.96 and interest 
												thereon.&nbsp; The defendants could 
												not be served personally with 
												the writ.&nbsp; Thus on 11<sup>th</sup> 
												June, 2007 the plaintiff 
												obtained an order to serve the 
												defendants by substitution in 
												the following manner. Posting 
												copies thereof and of this order 
												on: The High Court Notice Board, 
												Accra; The premises of the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												Defendant Company H/No. 1. 
												Graphic Road, Accra where it 
												shall remain for fourteen (14) 
												days. By one publication in the 
												Daily Graphic (See Exhibit A2 
												attached to plaintiff&#8217;s 
												affidavit).By the practice of 
												court when an order for 
												substituted service is granted, 
												it has to be formally drawn up 
												for service in the manner 
												ordered by the court.&nbsp; The 
												bailiff has to deposit in the 
												registry an affidavit of posting 
												or in the manner ordered by the 
												Court.&nbsp; </span>
												<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">
												In the instant case there is no 
												evidence on record that the 
												order for substituted service 
												was drawn up.&nbsp; There is also no 
												evidence of the bailiff&#8217;s 
												affidavit of service in the mode 
												ordered by the Court.&nbsp; The only 
												evidence is the Daily Graphic 
												publication of the suit which is 
												just one out of the three modes 
												of service that was ordered.&nbsp; It 
												follows therefore that the writ 
												of summons and statement of 
												claim were not served in 
												accordance with the terms of the 
												order granted on 11<sup>th</sup> 
												June, 2007 by this Court.&nbsp; It 
												also follows that any further

												application to set aside the 
												order for registration of the 
												Foreign Judgment and all 
												processes commenced or done by 
												the interested party pursuant to

												therefore wrote several letters

                                                for the same relief. Based on

                                                herein, is expending his

												$80,000 or its cedi equivalent 
												and Gh¢5,000.00 costs on the 
												defendants&#8217; counterclaim. The 
												applicant, claiming non service 
												on it of any notice of the date 
												for judgment first moved the 
												High Court on 10/9/2009 to set 
												aside both the delivery of 
												judgment and its entry and for 
												interim stay of execution of the 
												same.&nbsp; This application was 
												dismissed on 21/1/2010.&nbsp; On 
												29/1/2010 the applicant filed an 
												appeal against the Ruling 
												dismissing its said application 
												and also against the judgment 
												dated 8/1/2009 aforesaid.&nbsp; It 
												thereupon as a second step, 
												applied to the High Court for 
												stay of execution but same was 
												dismissed.&nbsp; The applicant&#8217;s 
												third step was to repeat its 
												application for stay before the 
												Court of Appeal, but withdrew 
												the same. Its forth step was to 
												file on 15/4/2010 an application 
												for interlocutory injunction 
												pending appeal.&nbsp; In the meantime 
												it obtained, (having earlier 
												failed in the High Court), leave 
												of the Court of Appeal on 
												16/6/2010 to amend its notice of 
												appeal by deleting that part 
												thereof relating to the original 
												judgment dated 8/1/2009 - </span>

												- By a Writ of Summons issued in 
												the High Court, Accra, on 9<sup>th</sup> 
												February 2009, Mr Sumaila 
												Bielbiel, the Respondent herein 
												(who is hereinafter referred to 
												as &#8216;the Respondent&#8217;) commenced 
												an action against Mr. Adamu 
												Dramani (who is hereinafter 
												referred to as &#8216;the Applicant&#8217;) 
												and the Attorney General,&nbsp; for 
												(inter alia) the following 
												reliefs:- A declaration that 
												defendant is a holder of a 
												British passport and therefore 
												owes allegiance to a country 
												other than Ghana and is 
												therefore disqualified from 
												holding the office of Member of 
												Parliament of the Republic of 
												Ghana. An injunction against the 
												Defendant restraining him from 
												holding himself out as a Member 
												of Parliament and compelling him 
												to vacate his seat in 
												Parliament.&#8221; ... etc The 
												Applicant entered conditional 
												appearance and applied to the 
												High Court for an order setting 
												aside the writ on the ground 
												that the said court lacked the 
												jurisdiction to entertain the 
												matter, since the cause of 
												action was in effect an election 
												petition and, as such, was out 
												of time and, in any event, ought 
												to have been commenced by a 
												Petition rather than a Writ of 
												Summons. The Learned High Court 
												Judge dismissed the application 
												to set aside the Writ of 
												Summons, and the Applicant 
												herein, being dissatisfied with 
												that decision, appealed to the 
												Court of Appeal. The learned 
												Justices of the Court of Appeal 
												upheld the Applicant&#8217;s appeal on 
												the main ground that, since the 
												Respondent, by his writ, was 
												seeking an order compelling 
												Applicant to vacate his 
												parliamentary seat, in the 
												circumstances of the case, he 
												was challenging the validity of 
												the Applicant&#8217;s election to 
												Parliament, and the matter was 
												in effect an election petition. 
												As such therefore, according to 
												their Lordships, by virtue of 
												Sections 16 and 18 of the 
												Representation of the People 
												Law, 1992 (PNDCL 284) (as well 
												as the terms of Order 2(2) of 
												the High Court (Civil Procedure) 
												Rules, 2004 (C.I. 47)), not only 
												was the action not commenced in 
												proper form, but moreover, the 
												same was also out of time. The 
												Court of Appeal, therefore, set 
												aside the Writ. <b>- </b></span>

                                              allegedly exported fish worth US$

                                              exchange that was guaranteed by 
                                              the erstwhile Volta Premier Rural 
                                              Bank Ltd. In the intervening 
                                              period the rural bank became 
                                              financially distressed and the 
                                              Bank of Ghana took over the 
                                              operations of the rural bank. 
                                              According to the Appellant despite

                                              issued a writ of summons on 15 
                                              December 1998 at the Accra High

                                              February 1999 and filed an

                                              Respondent on its part denied 
                                              having taken delivery of the fish

												<b>Chief Justice</b> - According 
												to the plaintiffs, who were a 
												firm of international traders in 
												the U.S.A., on 2nd September, 
												1987 they conveyed and sold to 
												the defendants by sea freight, a 
												consignment of 38,491 pairs of 
												used olive green shorts at the 
												price of USD 1.20 a pair, 25 
												pairs of soccer boots at USD 
												1.00 a pair, bringing the total 
												price of the goods to USD 
												46,214.20. Also, on 5th October 
												1989, they sold and conveyed to 
												the defendants, 1280 cartons of 
												sundry biscuits valued at USD 
												15,208. As at the time 
												plaintiffs instituted the 
												instant action the defendants 
												had paid USD 20,088 of the total 
												value of the goods and later USD 
												4,000.The Defendants did not 
												dispute the plaintiffs&#8217; claim 
												relating to the second 
												consignment of goods, but they 
												contended the first consignment 
												of used olive green shorts was 
												not sold to them but sent to 
												them on sell-or-return basis and 
												therefore they remain the 
												property of the plaintiffs and 
												were being kept in the 
												defendants&#8217; warehouse at ¢25,000 
												per year. The main issue between 
												the parties was, therefore, 
												whether the first consignment of 
												goods was sold to the defendants 
												or not; that is whether or not 
												the goods, the subject-matter of 
												the claim were sold to the 
												defendants outright or sold to 
												them on sell-or-return basis.In 
												their first ground of appeal the 
												defendants contend that the 
												court of Appeal erred in holding 
												that the provisions of Order 63 
												Rule 2A of the High Court (Civil 
												Procedure) Rules 1954 (L.N. 
												140A) as amended by L.I 1107 are 
												purely administrative (or 
												directory) and its infringement 
												by a Court will not render a 
												judgment null and void. They 
												also contend, that the judgment 
												of the Court of Appeal is null 
												and void, having been given on 
												15th April, 1999 a few days 
												after eight weeks after close of 
												case contrary to Rule 33 
												sub-rules 1 and 2 of the Court 
												of Appeal Rules, 1997, C.I. 19.<a href="2002A/P.%20S.%20INTERNATIONAL%20LIMITED%20&%20ORS.%20v.%20GODKA%20GROUP%20OF%20COMPANI.htm">

												Practice and Procedure - 
												Estoppel</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
												- <b>Judgment - Recovery of 
												possession - </b>This is an 
												appeal from the judgment of the 
												Court of Appeal dated 29/6/ 
												2000. It was a decision which 
												reversed the trial High Court's 
												judgment in favour of the 
												plaintiff/respondent/appellant 
												whom we shall hereafter refer to 
												simply as the appellant. The 
												defendants/appellants/respondents 
												will similarly be referred to as 
												the respondents simpliciter. The 
												appellant filed and argued four 
												grounds of appeal &#8212; two original 
												grounds plus two additional 
												grounds. They are that: The 
												judgment is wrong in law;The 
												judgment is against the weight 
												of evidence;The learned justices 
												erred in granting the order of 
												recovery of possession in the 
												absence of evidence that the 
												landlord had served the 
												requisite statutory notice on 
												the tenant which notice is a 
												condition precedent to taking 
												any action based on the said 
												breach;In view of the 
												substantial works on the 
												premises in the nature of 
												renovations, the learned 
												justices ought to have suspended 
												the order for recovery of 
												possession in the interest of 
												justice.The grounds (1) and (3) 
												above deserve some comment. Rule 
												6 (4) of the Supreme Court 
												Rules, 1996, C.I. 16 requires 
												that &quot; where a ground of appeal 
												is one of law the appellant 
												shall indicate the stage of the 
												proceedings at which it was 
												first raised&quot;. Ground (3) is 
												expressed as a ground of law and 
												the appellant ought to have 
												indicated whether he had raised 
												it before now, or whether he is 
												now raising it for the first 
												time. The significance of this 
												requirement will be seen later 
												in this judgment. Similarly, 
												when the appellant alleged in 
												ground (1) that the judgment is 
												wrong in law it seems that he is 
												in effect saying that there is 
												an error of law in the judgment; 
												we believe that was what he 
												intended to say. Indeed that 
												ground of appeal appears to have 
												been directed at the Court of 
												Appeal's holding that the 
												appellant was estopped per rem 
												judicatam from instituting the 
												action because the appellant's 
												submission on that ground is 
												that &quot; the instant case was not 
												properly within the realm of 
												estoppel per rem judicatam and 
												the Court of Appeal misapplied 
												the doctrine&quot;. In that regard 
												too the appellant again ought to 
												have indicated in the said 
												ground (1) the fact that the 
												decision as to the estoppel was 
												what he was attacking as having 
												rendered the judgment wrong in 
												law. If that holding amounted to 
												an error in law, then rule 6 (2) 
												requires the appellant to 
												specify it in the ground of 
												appeal as the subject of this 
												particular complaint &#8212; [see rule 
												6 (2)(f) of C.I. 16].- <b>

												The facts grounding the 
												application are contained in the 
												supporting affidavit filed on 
												8-12-2011. In it, the applicant 
												deposed that on 24 October 2011, 
												the plaintiff, respondent 
												herein, issued a writ of summons 
												and statement of claim against 
												the Ghana Medical Association 
												(hereinafter called the 
												applicant), for certain reliefs 
												and followed it with an 
												application for interlocutory 
												injunction restraining the 
												applicant from embarking on a 
												strike of any kind. On 1<sup>st</sup> 
												November 2011, the judge stated 
												in court he would like to 
												determine the matter on its 
												merits.&nbsp;Subsequently, the 
												chronology of events was that on 
												8<sup>th</sup> November, 2011, 
												the applicants filed an 
												affidavit in opposition to the 
												application for interim 
												injunction rather belatedly, 
												whereupon the plaintiff 
												respondent filed a supplementary 
												affidavit in response thereto. 
												Then the applicant filed a 
												statement of defence in which it 
												raised a preliminary objection 
												to the application for 
												injunction and also challenged 
												the capacity of the plaintiff 
												respondent to invoke the 
												jurisdiction of the High Court 
												in the matter. The court heard 
												both counsel for the parties 
												argue for and in opposition to 
												the legal objection thus raised. 
												After arguments from counsel the 
												judge was alleged to have stated 
												that &#8216;if he ruled in the 
												plaintiff/respondent&#8217;s favor in 
												the preliminary matter, he would 
												go ahead immediately and rule on 
												the interlocutory injunction 
												application.&#8217; He then adjourned 
												proceedings to 9<sup>th</sup> 
												December 2011 for his ruling.The 
												applicant deposed further in his 
												affidavit, he construed the 
												plaintiff&#8217;s substantive claim 
												before the court to be that it 
												was to enforce an alleged breach 
												of human rights; he recited the 
												procedure for invoking the 
												jurisdiction of the High Court 
												under the Human rights 
												provisions in the constitution, 
												1992, in the affidavit in 
												support of application for the 
												injunction. The applicant took 
												the view that by issuing a writ 
												of summons supported with a 
												statement of claim purporting to 
												invoke such jurisdiction, the 
												plaintiff respondent invoked the 
												jurisdiction of the High Court 
												wrongly. The Judge compounded 
												the error by entertaining it. 
												What he did was not only wrong, 
												but was also contrary to law. 
												Furthermore, when the judge said 
												he would rule on the 
												interlocutory injunction when 
												the capacity of the plaintiff 
												had not been investigated and 
												established, he evinced an 
												inclination of bias. </span><b>

												<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
												It has always been my 
												understanding that the 
												requirements for the grant of an 
												interlocutory injunction are: 
												first, that the applicant must 
												establish that there is a 
												serious question to be tried; 
												secondly, that he or she would 
												suffer irreparable damage which 
												cannot be remedied by the award 
												of damages, unless the 
												interlocutory injunction is 
												granted; and finally that the 
												balance of convenience is in 
												favour of granting him or her 
												the interlocutory injunction.&nbsp; 
												The balance of convenience, of 
												course, means weighing up the 
												disadvantages of granting the 
												relief against the disadvantages 
												of not granting the relief.&nbsp; 
												Where the relief sought relates, 
												as here, to a public law matter, 
												particular care must be taken 
												not to halt action presumptively 
												for the public good, unless 
												there are very cogent reasons to 
												do so, and provided also that 
												any subsequent nullification of 
												the impugned act or omission 
												cannot restore the status quo.&nbsp; 
												Given the reliefs that the 
												plaintiff is seeking in the 
												substantive suit in this case, 
												it is clear that if he succeeds 
												in securing the declarations he 
												has claimed, the impugned 
												provisions of the Local 
												Government Act, 1993 (Act 462) 
												will be declared void and any 
												actions made in pursuance of 
												them nullified.</span><b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">
												</span></b>
												<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
												Accordingly, no irreparable 
												damage will have been caused the 
												plaintiff during the period 
												between the issue of the writ 
												and the date of judgment.&nbsp; On 
												the other hand, the Government&#8217;s 
												programme for the creation of 
												districts would suffer 
												irreparable delay with a 
												knock-on effect on the general 
												elections scheduled for 
												December, which delay cannot be 
												remedied by monetary 
												compensation, if the plaintiff 
												should lose the substantive 
												action. - </span><b>

												The issue for determination in 
												this ruling is whether or not a 
												party&#8217;s statement of case filed 
												woefully out of time, can be 
												permitted to be amended, 
												especially where the defaulting 
												party has not asked for leave to 
												rectify the default. But first, 
												the brief facts. On 13th April 
												1981, the Plaintiff took action 
												at the Accra High Court against 
												the Defendants, claiming as 
												later amended:-&#8220;A declaration 
												that in or about June/July 1979 
												she was the owner of all that 
												piece or parcel of land situate 
												at Madina and known as&nbsp; House 
												NO. B/MDN/14 and fully described 
												in the attached&nbsp; plan and Deed 
												Registered as No. 4446/1978. 
												That the sale of the said 
												property by the 1st Defendant to 
												the 2nd Defendant in June 1979 
												is null and void.General 
												Damages&#8221;.Later on, one Osmanu 
												Alhassan was joined as 
												Co-plaintiff. On 14th August 
												1989, the trial High Court 
												dismissed the action with costs 
												against the Plaintiff and 
												Co-plaintiff. An appeal to the 
												Court of Appeal was also 
												dismissed on 25th July 1995. A 
												further appeal to the Supreme 
												Court was once again dismissed 
												on 17th June 1998. Still 
												undaunted the plaintiff and 
												co-plaintiff filed a motion on 
												2nd July 1998 for a review of 
												the Supreme Court&#8217;s judgment. It 
												is in respect of this review 
												application that the plaintiff 
												and Co-plaintiff/Applicants now 
												seek leave to amend their 
												statement of case.- <b>

                                                children took action to request 
                                                the Government to issue five 
                                                separate cheques for the benefit 
                                                of the five children. In that 
                                                action, the children of 
                                                Elizabeth Mansa Mancell were 
                                                represented by Josephine Akita

                                                discontinued the action. In

                                                took action in the Human Rights 
                                                Division of the High Court to 
                                                nullify the sale for the sole 
                                                reason that it was concluded 
                                                without the knowledge and 
                                                consent of the children of the 
                                                deceased Elizabeth Mansa Mancell. 
                                                It was in that action that the 
                                                applicant described herself as 
                                                the eldest daughter, 
                                                administratrix and 
                                                representative of herself and 
                                                the other two children. The 
                                                respondent is the High Court 
                                                judge who handled the action 
                                                which has culminated in this 
                                                application. The interested 
                                                parties are the other children 
                                                of the late Rosamund Mancell and 
                                                the Ghana government, the 
                                                purchaser of the Institute. In 
                                                the High Court, the applicant 
                                                applied for an interim 
                                                injunction against the 
                                                Government and the interested 
                                                persons in the instant 
                                                application. The trial judge 
                                                dismissed the injunction and the 
                                                entire action. He proceeded to 
                                                order the Government to take 
                                                over the Institute. The 
                                                applicant appealed against the 
                                                decision of the court. She then 
                                                filed a motion to restrain the 
                                                interested parties from acting 
                                                in any manner inconsistent with 
                                                the applicants&#8217; beneficial 
                                                interest in the Institute. The 
                                                motion was predicated on the 
                                                appeal filed against the 
                                                decision of High Court. The 
                                                return date for the motion was 
                                                11 November 2009. On the 10 
                                                November, the High Court 
                                                registrar served Form 6 on the 
                                                applicant. Counsel for the 
                                                applicant took the view that 
                                                since Form 6 had been served, 
                                                the Court of Appeal was seised 
                                                of the case and that the High 
                                                Court had no jurisdiction over 
                                                the matter. The High Court judge 
                                                ruled that he had jurisdiction 
                                                and dismissed the application 
                                                for injunction. A writ of 
                                                possession was issued in favour 
                                                of the interested parties. The 
                                                applicant thereafter applied to 
                                                this court for an order of 
                                                certiorari to quash the last 
                                                decision of the High Court for 
                                                two reasons: Firstly that the 
                                                High Court judge had no 
                                                jurisdiction over the case since 
                                                the issuance of Form 6 
                                                automatically transferred the 
                                                case to the Court of Appeal: 
                                                Secondly there was a breach of 
                                                the <i>audi alteram partem</i> 
                                                rule since she was not heard on 
                                                the motion before the judge and 
                                                further that an affidavit filed 
                                                by the interested party was not 
                                                served on the applicant before 
                                                the judge disposed of the case. 
                                                The first ground turned on the

												By its writ herein, issued on 
												April 04, 2001, the Plaintiff 
												sought, inter alia, the 
												following reliefs:&quot;1. A 
												declaration that the former 
												President of the Republic, Flt. 
												Lt. Jerry John Rawlings is 
												entitled to all the facilities 
												available to him as President 
												and such facilities including 
												his military security detail 
												shall not be varied to his

												lifetime. 2. An order directed 
												at the Defendant that no such 
												variation in the facilities 
												available to him as President 
												shall be varied without his 
												consent during his lifetime. 3. 
												An injunction restraining the 
												Defendant and the government it 
												represents, their agents...from 
												varying the facilities available 
												to the said President Jerry John 
												Rawlings during his lifetime as 
												prescribed by the 
												Constitution''. Subsequent to 
												the issuing of this writ, the 
												Plaintiff, on May 25th 2001, 
												filed a motion for an order 
												holding the Defendant in 
												contempt of this Court. However, 
												on June 12th 2001, when the 
												motion came on for a hearing, 
												Counsel for the Plaintiff orally 
												sought leave to withdraw its 
												application, which leave was

												This is an appeal against the 
												striking out of an appeal and

												Court of appeal.&nbsp; The facts 
												which appear to be simple are 
												that the appellant was a 
												Co-defendant in a case which was 
												heard before the High Court, 
												Tema.&nbsp; The judgment in the case 
												was delivered on 11/10/2001 and 
												the appellant who felt aggrieved

												on the 2/11/2001.&nbsp; As enjoined 
												by procedural rules of the 
												court, the appellant and the 
												respondent herein were invited 
												by the registrar of the High 
												Court to settle records for the 
												appeal.&nbsp; The parties herein did 
												not appear before the registrar 
												of the Tema High Court on 21<sup>st</sup> 
												of January 2005 to settle the 
												records by themselves.&nbsp; The 
												solicitor for the respondent, 
												however, wrote a letter to the

												Kojo Akrong who died intestate

												and between 1972 and 1983, 
												Ibrahim Lassey Akrong whom

line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">statement 
												of claim could be briefly 
												captured as follows. Her husband 
												the late Kyei a retired sergeant 
												of the Ghana Army, was employed 
												as a security personnel at the 
												Ashanti regional office when the 
												co-defendant, a serving senior 
												military officer was also there. 
												There developed a close 
												relationship between them. When 
												Kyei evinced an intention of 
												acquiring a house, he discussed 
												with his friend the 
												co-defendant. The co-defendant 
												discouraged him from acquiring a 
												house at Atonsu but rather 
												advised that if Kyei could 
												provide an amount of money to 
												the tune of ¢25,000 cedis he 
												could help him acquire an estate 
												house built by the SHC. Though 
												he had been assured that the 
												¢25000 cedis was enough, after 
												it had been started Kyei 
												realised that it was not enough 
												and that he had to look for 
												extra money for some more 
												building materials. He was 
												eventually introduced to the 
												project foreman of SHC as the 
												owner of the building and the 
												one to purchase the extra 
												building materials.&nbsp; Kyei 
												therefore paid for the necessary 
												materials required for the 
												completion of the project. He 
												also did the terrazzo works and 
												moved in with his family. Even 
												though Kyei kept requesting for 
												the title documents on the 
												property and also the receipt 
												for the monies paid to &nbsp;the 
												Commander, he never had them. 
												Kyei and his family started 
												living in the house before 
												the1979 military uprising and 
												lived in it till he died in 
												1996. Before he died however the 
												defendants, a sister and a 
												nephew of Commander Osei were 
												permitted by him at the request 
												of Commander Osei to live in the 
												house temporarily when the 
												sister was divorced from her 
												husband. &nbsp;Kyei died intestate in 
												1996 and his family continued 
												their long occupation of the 
												house until 16<sup>th</sup> 
												December 2000 when men from the 
												police striking force, without 
												any court warrant, but acting at 
												the instance of Commander Osei, 
												in a sheer brute show of force, 
												forcibly ejected Kyei&#8217;s family 
												and effectively installed 
												Commander Osei&#8217;s people in the 
												house. The plaintiff therefore 
												instituted an action at the High 
												Court - <b>

												The respective cases of the

												concisely at this stage. &nbsp;For 
												the plaintiff, she stated she 
												built the house in dispute with 
												her late husband, who was the 
												son of the defendant. The 
												relationship between the 
												plaintiff and defendant then was 
												that of a daughter-in-law to 
												mother-in-law. Much obviously, 
												from the record, the plaintiff 
												did not provide any evidence on 
												how she obtained title to the 
												land on which the house was 
												built. She nevertheless gave 
												evidence on how they built the 
												house and called the mason to 
												support her case. So did she 
												tender evidence of receipts 
												issued for the purchase of the 
												materials for the construction 
												of the house. The high point of 
												her case was that she and her 
												husband stayed in the house 
												parts of which she built, till 
												his death, after which the 
												defendant move in to stay with 
												her and attempted to oust her 
												from it, asserting claim of 
												ownership thereto.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>- </b>

												- <b>Damages for trespass -</b> 
												The case of the plaintiff, as 
												stated in his statement of 
												claim, is that the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												defendant, Kofi Boateng, who is 
												his first cousin introduced one 
												Madam Ramatu Futa (the original 
												owner of the house in dispute) 
												to him and he purchased the said 
												house. After purchasing the 
												house, he gave the receipt, 
												indenture and other documents of 
												the house to the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												defendant to process for him at 
												the Lands Department. The 
												plaintiff claims that the house 
												was in a dilapidated state and 
												tenants were occupying it. He, 
												therefore, ejected all the 
												tenants and renovated it from 
												his own resources. After the 
												renovation, he occupied the 
												house with his wife and family, 
												in 1990, and rented part to 
												tenants. He, also, paid property 
												rates. The 1<sup>st</sup> 
												defendant, the plaintiff&#8217;s 
												alleges, refused or failed to 
												return the documents on the 
												house to him despite repeated 
												demands. Subsequently, the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												defendant started to lay adverse 
												claim to the house. 1<sup>st</sup> 
												defendant took action against 
												him at the then Community 
												Tribunal, sitting at the 
												Community Centre, in or about 
												1999, for recovery of possession 
												and on 05-12-2000, the court 
												gave judgment for the 1<sup>st</sup> 
												defendant and the latter ejected 
												him the same day. However, on an 
												application by his (plaintiff) 
												lawyer to the High Court, the 
												decision of the Community 
												Tribunal was quashed in or about 
												December, 2002. Despite the High 
												Court&#8217;s decision, all efforts by 
												the plaintiff to repossess the 
												house in dispute proved futile. 
												The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant, 
												rather, put the other defendants 
												in occupation of the house and, 
												even though they all know that 
												he (plaintiff) is the owner of 
												the house, they have refused to 
												recognize him as their landlord

												The case for the plaintiff is

												Emmanuel Adotey Akueson 
												(deceased) to construct twelve 
												stores (12) on the plot of land 
												No. B11/1, Abossey Okai, Accra 
												which belonged to the said 
												Emmanuel Adotey Akueson.&nbsp; 
												According to the plaintiff, the 
												parties agreed that the 
												deceased, will collect the rents 
												in respect of the first six (6) 
												stores to be completed while the 
												plaintiff completes the next six 
												(6) stores.&nbsp; Thereafter, the 
												twelve stores were to be shared 
												equally. The plaintiff says that 
												after the completion of the 
												first six stores which were the 
												ground &nbsp;floors, each store was 
												leased out for GH¢3000 and the 
												money paid to Mr. Akueson, who

												thereafter. The defendant who 
												was granted letters of 
												administration to administer the 
												estate of his father Emmanuel 
												Adotey Akueson came down from 
												his place of residence in 
												Germany and gave a Power of

												the remaining (6) six stores on

												There is uncontroverted evidence

												Osu was self-acquired by Henry 
												Emmanuel Richter (deceased) 
												hereinafter to be referred to as 
												Henry). Indeed, in both the

												that Mrs. Clara Richter, Henry&#8217;s 
												wedded wife made any

												acquisition of H/No. F 375/1,

												married Clara Richter. In my 
												view this attempt by plaintiff 
												was superflous since defendant 
												never challenged the fact of the 
												self-acquisition of the subject 
												matter in dispute by Henry At 
												any rate, considering the issues 
												for determination, whether the 
												acquisition of the property in

												married Clara or he acquired 
												this property during the 
												subsistence of the marriage or

												uncontroverted piece of evidence 
												on record that Henry&nbsp; married 
												Mrs. Clara under the Gold Coast 
												Ordinance No. 14 of 1884 in 
												1936. In other words that 
												marriage is distinquishable from

												is also recognisable under the 
												law but has its own peculiar 
												incidents with respect to 
												property rights. It is on record 
												that Henry died in 1967 
												intestate possessed of the 
												property in dispute. The 
												evidence indicated that at the 
												time of Henry&#8217;s death he was 
												staying with Mrs. Clara and 
												defendant&nbsp; in the very house in 
												dispute.The question to pose in 
												this case is what was the legal

												Property - Recovery of

												execution -</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
												The facts of the instant case 
												are that the Applicants 
												(hereinafter referred to as the 
												Defendants) had judgment entered 
												against them in the Circuit 
												Court on the 21st of October, 
												1999. The Court ordered them to 
												give up possession of a house to 
												the Interested Parties in these 
												proceedings (hereinafter 
												referred to as the Plaintiffs). 
												The Defendants, dissatisfied 
												with the judgment and 
												consequential orders, filed an 
												appeal to the Court of Appeal on 
												the 28th day of October, 1999 
												and then followed this with an 
												application for stay of 
												execution pending an appeal. 
												This application was filed on 
												29th October, 1999. Meanwhile, 
												the Plaintiffs, also on the same 
												day, applied ex-parte, for a 
												writ of possession to enable 
												them recover possession of the 
												house as decreed in the 
												judgment. Pursuant to the writ 
												for recovery of possession, the 
												Deputy Sheriff effected the 
												ejectment of the Defendants. But 
												believing, to use their own 
												words, that &quot;the exercise was 
												unlawful as having been carried 
												out when the motion for stay of 
												execution pending appeal... had 
												not been heard&quot; the Defendants 
												adopted self-help and reinstated 
												themselves in the house from 
												which they had earlier been 
												ejected by the Deputy Sheriff. 
												The Plaintiff then cited the 
												Defendants in the High Court for 
												contempt. The High Court found 
												the Defendants guilty but 
												adjourned to two weeks for 
												sentence. Though it is not clear 
												from the record, we feel this 
												adjournment could have been 
												intended to give the Defendants 
												a chance to purge themselves. 
												However they rather chose to 
												apply to this Court for an order 
												of certiorari and prohibition to 
												first quash the ruling of the 
												High Court dated 10th July, 2000 
												convicting them of contempt and 
												secondly to prohibit the said 
												Court from proceeding to 
												sentence them. The ground urged 
												on behalf of this application 
												was that there was an error of 
												law apparent on the face of the 
												record. The error cited was that 
												the writ of recovery of 
												possession ought not to have 
												been made in view of the 
												pendency of the motion for stay 
												of execution pending appeal.- <b>

												The basis of the plaintiff&#8217;s 
												claim is that plot number 18, 
												Ring Road South Industrial Area, 
												Accra, (herein after referred to 
												as plot number 18) is a 
												government plot which was 
												granted by the Government on 
												lease to Ghana Furniture 
												Manufacturing Company Ltd 
												(herein after referred to as the 
												company) for 50 years from 10<sup>th</sup> 
												December 1959. The company was 
												to put up structures on the plot 
												to be used for industrial 
												purposes only. The company 
												however assigned its interest in 
												plot number 18 to the plaintiff 
												at a time that it had rented 
												part of the premises to the 
												plaintiff and the other part to 
												the defendants for a term of ten 
												years with five years option 
												effective from 1<sup>st</sup> 
												March 1996. The defendant had 
												also then subletted part of its 
												sublease to the plaintiff. The 
												plaintiff claimed that since it 
												had acquired the whole plot 
												number 18, and the defendants&#8217; 
												10 year sublease had lapsed, the 
												defendants should vacate from 
												the premises because they needed 
												the place for their own 
												business. The plaintiffs also 
												claimed that the defendants are 
												using the premises as 
												residential instead of using it 
												for industrial purposes and were 
												also a nuisance to them. The 
												defendants&#8217; case is that they 
												had a total of 15 year tenancy 
												from the company, which tenancy 
												is to expire in 2011. Since the 
												company&#8217;s lease expires on 2009, 
												by operation of law, the 
												defendants&#8217; tenancy has become 
												an assignment of the lease.-

												building situate in Tamale that 
												was being utilized as a hotel 
												(the property) was&nbsp;&nbsp; allotted to

												the property it would be sold to 
												him at an agreed price the 
												plaintiff offered to buy the 
												property, a decision which meant 
												that she had to buy off the 
												interests of the other four 
												beneficiaries, As she was not 
												able on her own to raise the 
												purchase price of the property, 
												she approached the first 
												defendant, her uterine sister to 
												assist her in buying off the 
												interest of the four 
												beneficiaries. It appears that 
												although the sister initially 
												agreed, she resiled therefrom 
												and had to be persuaded so to do 
												by members of her family 
												including her mother and indeed 
												her husband.&nbsp; When subsequently 
												she paid up the purchase price, 
												she claimed she did so because 
												the plaintiff had agreed with

												quantum of her contribution 
												which was two thirds of the 
												value of the property, she was 
												to hold two thirds of the

												Property - Recovery of 
												possession &#8211; Contempt - Stay of 
												execution -</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
												The facts of the instant case 
												are that the Applicants 
												(hereinafter referred to as the 
												Defendants) had judgment entered 
												against them in the Circuit 
												Court on the 21st of October, 
												1999. The Court ordered them to 
												give up possession of a house to 
												the Interested Parties in these 
												proceedings (hereinafter 
												referred to as the Plaintiffs). 
												The Defendants, dissatisfied 
												with the judgment and 
												consequential orders, filed an 
												appeal to the Court of Appeal on 
												the 28th day of October, 1999 
												and then followed this with an 
												application for stay of 
												execution pending an appeal. 
												This application was filed on 
												29th October, 1999. Meanwhile, 
												the Plaintiffs, also on the same 
												day, applied ex-parte, for a 
												writ of possession to enable 
												them recover possession of the 
												house as decreed in the 
												judgment. Pursuant to the writ 
												for recovery of possession, the 
												Deputy Sheriff effected the 
												ejectment of the Defendants. But 
												believing, to use their own 
												words, that &quot;the exercise was 
												unlawful as having been carried 
												out when the motion for stay of 
												execution pending appeal... had 
												not been heard&quot; the Defendants 
												adopted self-help and reinstated 
												themselves in the house from 
												which they had earlier been 
												ejected by the Deputy Sheriff. 
												The Plaintiff then cited the 
												Defendants in the High Court for 
												contempt. The High Court found 
												the Defendants guilty but 
												adjourned to two weeks for 
												sentence. Though it is not clear 
												from the record, we feel this 
												adjournment could have been 
												intended to give the Defendants 
												a chance to purge themselves. 
												However they rather chose to 
												apply to this Court for an order 
												of certiorari and prohibition to 
												first quash the ruling of the 
												High Court dated 10th July, 2000 
												convicting them of contempt and 
												secondly to prohibit the said 
												Court from proceeding to 
												sentence them. The ground urged 
												on behalf of this application 
												was that there was an error of 
												law apparent on the face of the 
												record. The error cited was that 
												the writ of recovery of 
												possession ought not to have 
												been made in view of the 
												pendency of the motion for stay 
												of execution pending appeal.- <b>

                                                plaintiff accepting an

                                                the Plaintiff had made it known 
                                                to the defendants that she had 
                                                planned to relocate to Ghana and 
                                                make it her home. Plaintiff 
                                                thereafter resided with the 
                                                Defendants anytime she visited

                                                defendant fell in love. 
                                                According to the facts on 
                                                record, the 1<sup>st</sup> 
                                                defendant then proposed to marry 
                                                the plaintiff at the Cape Coast

                                                took place, the relationship 
                                                between the parties grew 
                                                stronger with the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
                                                defendant not showing any signs 
                                                of rivalry and jealousy as women 
                                                are by nature bound to show. 
                                                According to the plaintiff, she 
                                                was convinced by the defendants

                                                construction of a house on a 
                                                vacant plot of land belonging to 
                                                the defendants. The plaintiff

                                                contributed substantially to the 
                                                construction of the house on 
                                                this land.When the house was 
                                                barely completed, the plaintiff 
                                                moved into occupation later 
                                                followed by defendants with the 
                                                plaintiff virtually occupying 
                                                the first floor of the house and 
                                                the defendants the ground floor. 
                                                Even though the defendants 
                                                dispute the substantial 
                                                contributions of the plaintiff 
                                                towards the construction of the 
                                                house, they did not take steps 
                                                to prevent the plaintiff from 
                                                either occupying the house 
                                                altogether or the almost 50% 
                                                sharing of the occupancy.The 
                                                Plaintiff later brought her

                                                of America to reside with the

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is an appeal against the 
												unanimous judgment of the Court 
												of Appeal dated 14th December, 
												2000 affirming an award made by 
												the trial High Court at Kumasi 
												on 22nd January, 1999. This High 
												Court Judge made the award 
												pursuant to his own previous 
												order for the valuation and 
												sharing of the assets and 
												liabilities of a school owned 
												jointly by the parties. The 
												appellant contends that the 
												properties of the school had not 
												been &#8220;professionally or 
												otherwise valued&#8221; before the 
												award was made by the High Court 
												and that the Court of Appeal was 
												wrong in affirming the said 
												award. The dispute between the 
												parties was primarily about the 
												ownership of a school 
												established in Kwadaso, Kumasi, 
												in the Ashanti Region and called 
												the Minnesota International 
												School. It was originally 
												established by four men in 1982. 
												In 1984, two of the four 
												founders decided to quit, and 
												the parties herein were left to 
												run the school as joint owners. 
												The plaintiff in the suit is the 
												appellant before us and the 
												defendant is the respondent. I 
												shall hereafter refer to them as 
												Appellant and Respondent. They 
												were the two left behind to run 
												the school. They entered into a 
												partnership agreement and 
												registered the school in their 
												joint names as owners.The 
												appellant became the Headmaster 
												of the school, and the 
												Respondent took the office of 
												Financial/Administrative 
												manager, up to 1992. Troubles 
												started in about 1992 when, 
												according to the appellant, the 
												respondent refused to render 
												accounts and claimed to be the 
												sole owner of the school. When 
												matters came to a head, the 
												appellant sued the respondent on 
												10th May, 1994 at the High Court 
												in Kumasi, claiming a 
												&#8220;declaration that the plaintiff 
												and the defendant jointly own&#8221; 
												the school.- <b>

												The facts in this case as agreed 
												to by the parties are that one 
												Ebenezer Kwadwo Donkor 
												(deceased), father of the 
												Managing Director of the 
												Plaintiff Company took a fifty 
												years lease from the deceased 
												mother of the Defendant from 1<sup>st</sup> 
												July, 1977.&nbsp; The lease was 
												tendered as exhibit &#8216;D&#8217;. A house 
												was built on the land by the 
												deceased and same was devised to 
												the plaintiff company.&nbsp; Apart 
												from the fact that the lessee 
												was to pay and discharge all 
												existing and future rates, 
												charges, taxes etc imposed on 
												the demised land, he was to pay 
												to the lessor 25% of the 
												assessed annual economic rent of 
												twelve thousand cedis (¢12,000) 
												for the first three (3) years 
												and thereafter thirty (30%) 
												percent payable five years in 
												advance. That this ¢12,000 or (GH¢1.20) 
												was considered to be too low so 
												it was reassessed.&nbsp; The 
												Plaintiff then insisted that the 
												redemption clause should also be 
												changed since the rent had been 
												changed and be replaced with a 
												proposed new lease which was 
												sent to the defendant to sign 
												but for which he refused to 
												sign. The Defendant agreed to 
												all these facts and stated that 
												he never agreed to the proposed 
												lease, except the assessed 
												economic rent, which he 
												compelled the plaintiff to pay 
												after its agreement.&nbsp; The

												Looking at the Statement of 
												Claim (as amended on 24th July, 
												1998, pursuant to leave granted 
												on 13th July, 1998), the main 
												thrust of the Appellant&#8217;s case 
												was that he purchased the 
												property from its previous 
												owner, Unilever Ghana Limited, 
												who, after the sale, by a letter 
												dated 29th December 1995, 
												informed the Respondent of the 
												transfer of ownership and 
												requested him to attorned 
												tenancy to the Appellant. 
												According to the Appellant, the 
												Respondent duly attorned tenancy 
												to him by paying rent up to 30th 
												July 1996. However, since 1st 
												July 1996, the Respondent had 
												continued to occupy the premises 
												without paying any rent, despite 
												the Appellant&#8217;s repeated demands 
												for rent. Also according to the 
												Appellant, the rent at the time 
												the Respondent attorned tenancy 
												to him was the Cedi equivalent 
												of $2,125.00 per month.By his 
												Statement of Defence, the 
												Respondent contended that the 
												sale of the property was a sham 
												and he, therefore, denied that 
												the appellant is the owner of 
												the property. He, however, 
												admitted in paragraph 4 that he 
												is the tenant of the premises as 
												averred in paragraph 2 of the 
												Statement of Claim. It appears 
												to us that the key portions of 
												the Statement of Defence are 
												paragraphs 3 and 5-9, which read 
												as follows<b>:&#8212;

												The Plaintiff/ Respondent was 
												the original owner of the 
												subject matter of this appeal; 
												House No. 270/9, Accra New Town. 
												Unfortunately, it was sold by 
												public auction at the instance 
												of the Accra City Council in 
												August 1987 and bought by one 
												Odartey Lamptey (PW2). But 
												thereafter, he sold the 
												property, (so he thought), to 
												the Respondent after he had been 
												paid an amount of C1800 
												representing the cost of the 
												auction price and other 
												incidental expenses he alleged 
												he had incurred. His story is 
												that he was moved by the tearful 
												pleas of the Respondent, the 
												original owner and his family to 
												relinquish his interest in the 
												property. The repayment to him 
												was not effected by the 
												Respondent alone, but with the 
												full participation of the 
												Appellants and their witness, 
												DW2.The puzzle which our courts 
												have been trying to unravel for 
												the past nineteen years is; who 
												actually bought this property? 
												Was it the Respondent, or the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Appellant for the simple reason 
												that, oddly, both parties are 
												now laying claim to it? While 
												the Respondent contends that he 
												borrowed money from the 1st 
												Appellant&#8217;s father to redeem the 
												property for himself, with the 
												clear understanding that the 
												lender collects the rents and 
												uses it to defray the loan, and 
												clearly therefore in 
												circumstances that amount to a 
												pledge, the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
												Appellant on the other hand 
												maintains that the transaction 
												between herself and the 
												Respondent was not a pledge, but 
												an outright sale of the property 
												to her, with the original owner 
												only serving as the conduit. The 
												Respondent maintains that he was 
												compelled by the Appellants&#8217; 
												failure to account for all rents 
												collected, to institute this 
												action in 1988 (1) to recover 
												possession of the house and (2) 
												for an order of account of all 
												rents collected from January 
												1970 to the date of judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
												Both the trial and appellate 
												courts determined the principal 
												issue of whether the transaction 
												between the parties was a pledge 
												or an outright sale in the 
												Respondent&#8217;s favour - </span><b>

												The

												(who are subsequently referred

												administrators of the Estate of 
												the late Opanyin Yaw Koranteng 
												of Asamankese, while the 
												Defendant is the son of the late 
												Opanyin Kwame Addo of Agona 
												Swedru, an uterine brother of 
												the said Opanyin Koranteng.&nbsp; The 
												brothers were from Abetiti, 
												Kwahu, but had settled in 
												Asamankese and Agona Swedru 
												respectively to carry on their 
												business of trading.The 
												conflicting evidence relates to 
												the purchase of a particular 
												piece of real estate in Agona 
												Swedru from the United Africa 
												Company.&nbsp; A Deed of Assignment 
												relating to the transaction was 
												executed between the late Yaw 
												Koranteng and the UAC on 29<sup>th</sup> 
												May 1972 and registered in the 
												Deeds Registry (See Exhibit B at 
												p.116 of the Record).&nbsp; Before 
												the execution of the Deed, 
												however, there was evidence 
												showing that Opanyin Kwame Addo 
												had made the initial contact 
												with UAC and that the receipt 
												for the purchase price of NC 
												9,000 issued by UAC in respect 
												of the property had been issued 
												in his name on 20<sup>th</sup> 
												September 1971 (See Exhibit 1A 
												at p. 118 of the Record).&nbsp; A 
												letter from the Acting Eastern 
												Region Properties Manager of the 
												UAC, dated 3<sup>rd</sup> 
												September, 1971 (Exhibit 1B, at 
												p. 119 of the Record), which is 
												addressed to Mr. Kwame Addo of 
												Agona Swedru, refers to his 
												offer of NC 9,000 and indicates 
												that it is receiving favourable 
												consideration.&nbsp; On 14<sup>th</sup> 
												September, 1971 the Ghana 
												Properties Manager of UAC wrote 
												to Mr. Kwame Addo, accepting , 
												subject to contract, his offer 
												to purchase the property in 
												question for NC9,000. (See 
												Exhibit 1D at p. 121 of the 
												Record).&nbsp; There is other 
												correspondence also on record 
												which confirms that the actual 
												negotiation resulting in the 
												sale of the Agona Swedru 
												property to Mr. Koranteng was 
												carried out by Mr. Kwame Addo. 
												The Plaintiffs&#8217; case was that 
												Opanyin Koranteng owned the 
												Agona Swedru property and that 
												the Deed of Assignment was 
												binding proof of that fact.&nbsp; 
												However, after the purchase of 
												the property, he had authorised 
												his elder brother, Opanyin Kwame 
												Addo, who was resident locally 
												in Agona Swedru to take care of

												The

												(whom I will subsequently refer

												ownership of the plot and holds 
												a land title certificate 
												relating to it.&nbsp; He was also the 
												principal shareholder in General 
												Cold Industry Limited, 
												incorporated in 1974. This 
												company was carrying on business 
												on the land and premises in 
												dispute, when the Armed Forces 
												Revolutionary Council 
												confiscated the proprietary 
												rights of the company and all 
												shares in it by Decree in 1979 (AFRCD 
												31).&nbsp; That Decree did not 
												purport to confiscate the land 
												and premises on which the 
												confiscated enterprise conducted 
												its business.&nbsp; The confiscated 
												enterprise was given to the 
												Ghana Industrial Holding 
												Corporation (GIHOC) to run.&nbsp; 
												GIHOC took charge of both the 
												enterprise and the premises in 
												which it did its business and 
												continued running the business 
												on Plot No. 19. The business was 
												restored to the defendant, after 
												the return of constitutional 
												rule in 1979.&nbsp; The defendant 
												testified that he was allowed&nbsp; 
												through the courts to take back 
												his properties in 1980 (p.113 of 
												the Record).&nbsp; However, the 
												business was re-confiscated 
												after the PNDC took power.&nbsp; This 
												was done by PNDC Law 30 in 
												1982.&nbsp; GIHOC resumed the 
												ownership and management of the 
												enterprise and changed its name 
												to GIHOC Refrigeration and 
												Household Products Ltd. in 1984 
												The defendant endeavoured to 
												secure the return of his 
												confiscated properties and 
												petitioned the authorities 
												several times to that end.&nbsp; 
												Eventually, he thought his 
												efforts had been crowned with a 
												degree of success when a letter

												Property - Recovery - Possession 
												- </span></b>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The facts relied on by parties 
												to establish their respective 
												cases were not complicated. The 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s case was that S.K. 
												Opoku the deceased, was his 
												uncle. He was a trader at Akuse 
												in the Eastern Region. He stayed 
												with him at Akuse as a young man 
												and worked in one of his stores. 
												After some time his uncle gifted 
												one of his stores at Akuse to 
												him. Not long after that, his 
												uncle decided to move from Akuse 
												to Accra. The Plaintiff, 
												however, remained at Akuse and 
												worked in his store. In 1968, 
												the Plaintiff&#8217;s said&nbsp; uncle 
												invited him to Accra and 
												informed him that his church, 
												the True Faith Church, had 
												acquired land from the Alajo 
												chief which had been partitioned 
												and was being allocated to 
												members of the church. The 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s uncle told him he 
												had wanted to pass it on to his 
												brother, Osei Kwaku but Osei 
												declined the offer. A similar 
												offer was made to the deceased&#8217;s 
												sister (the Plaintiff&#8217;s aunt), 
												Amma Mansah but she also 
												declined to have it. 
												Consequently, the deceased had 
												decided to surrender this land 
												to the Plaintiff. This 
												discussion, the Plaintiff 
												claimed, was held in the 
												presence of Osei and Amma Mansah. 
												The Plaintiff accepted the land 
												in their presence. The 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s case was that he 
												paid about ¢800.00 to his 
												deceased uncle to pay for the 
												cost of the land and 
												subsequently sent or gave 
												various sums to him to supervise 
												the building of a house on the 
												land for him. The uncle 
												supervised the construction of 
												the &#8220;Boys Quarters&#8221; and the 
												first floor of the building. In 
												or about 1979, the Plaintiff&#8217;s 
												uncle, S.K. Opoku, became unwell 
												and decided to go back to his 
												hometown, Obo, in the Kwahu 
												Traditional Area. At that time 
												the building had not been 
												completed but his uncle was 
												living on the first floor. The 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s case that his 
												deceased uncle called him to 
												Accra and told him of his 
												decision to re-locate to Obo. He 
												suggested to the Plaintiff to 
												approach an elder of the church, 
												Opanin Joseph, to supervise the 
												erection of the remaining floors 
												of the house for him. Later, the 
												Plaintiff himself came to live 
												in Accra. At that time the 
												second floor had been completed 
												and he settled in it. He took 
												over the supervision from Opanin 
												Joseph. In due course, the 
												building was completed. The 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s uncle, S.K. Opoku 
												died in 1984. The Plaintiff 
												continued to live in the house 
												without let or hindrance until 
												1989 when the first defendant 
												(or one of her daughters) 
												approached him and begged that 
												her mother be given one room in 
												the house for her use. The 
												Plaintiff turned down the 
												request so the Plaintiff&#8217;s 
												uncle, Osei Kwaku, was 
												approached to intercede on her 
												behalf. Still he refused her a 
												room. The Defendants reported 
												the Plaintiff to the CDR 
												alleging that he was occupying 
												their father&#8217;s (or husband&#8217;s) 
												house and had refused to give to 
												the first defendant one room to 
												live in. By various threats and 
												stratagems the CDR, made an 
												interim order (against the 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s will) whereby the 
												first defendant was settled in 
												one room in the house with the 
												excuse that there were vacant 
												rooms in the house. It was on 
												account of these matters that he 
												instituted the present action 
												against the defendants.- <b>

												Property &#8211; Lease - Letters of

												</span></b>
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The facts giving rise to the 
												litigation are as follows: The 
												case concerns a house which was 
												originally owned by one Mark 
												George Okai. He died intestate 
												on 17<sup>th</sup> September 
												1939, leaving behind male and 
												female children. On his death, 
												letters of administration were 
												granted to William George Okai, 
												his eldest son, and Samuel 
												Adotei Brown, his nephew. Both 
												died later. On 14<sup>th</sup> 
												August 1945, two daughters of 
												Mark G Okai entered into a lease 
												agreement with Nicholas Timothy 
												Clerk in respect of that house. 
												The house was leased to the 
												latter for sixty years at a 
												yearly rental of sixty pounds 
												commencing from 1<sup>st</sup> 
												August 1945. The lessee paid 
												seven hundred and fifty pounds 
												on execution of the lease and 
												another seven hundred and fifty 
												pounds, the latter being 
												one-half of the children&#8217;s 
												share. The children&#8217;s share was 
												later returned to the lessee and 
												was never repaid by him. By 
												calculation, the lessee paid 
												rent from 1<sup>st</sup> August 
												1945 to 30<sup>th</sup> April 
												1964 which amounted to eighteen 
												years and nine months. In spite 
												of the execution of the lease, 
												some of the children of Mark G. 
												Okai remained in occupation of 
												the house and even collected 
												rents from some tenants. The 
												lessee took action against those 
												children, claiming two hundred 
												pounds as damages for trespass, 
												an order of ejectment and refund 
												of rents collected by them. He 
												obtained judgment against them. 
												The co-defendants in that case 
												appealed to the West African 
												Court of Appeal (WACA). The 
												appeal failed. The WACA judgment 
												ordered the lessee, at his own 
												expense, to obtain planning 
												permit, pull down the existing 
												structure and construct an 
												entirely new building in its 
												place. He failed to comply with 
												that order. He also failed to 
												pay rent from May 1964. In June 
												1983, the surviving children of 
												the late Mark Okai sued the 
												lessee for one thousand one 
												hundred and forty five pounds 
												being rent arrears for 229 
												months from 1<sup>st</sup> May 
												1964 to 1<sup>st</sup> May 1983, 
												mesne profits and forfeiture of 
												the lease for breach of covenant 
												to pay rent and non compliance 
												with the order of WACA already 
												referred to. For convenience, 
												those children will be referred 
												to as the plaintiffs and the 
												original defendant will be 
												referred to as N. T. Clerk for 
												short. - <b>

												The Plaintiff avers that she is

												and that she brought the action 
												on behalf of her said maternal 
												family. She alleges that 
												Defendants are the children of 
												the late Kwabena Asante alias 
												Kwabena Dan, her granduncle. 
												That late Kwabena Asante was one 
												of the four children of her 
												great grand mother the late

												lived at Old Ampabame in 
												Kumasi.It is her case that the 
												Old Ampabame Township was 
												relocated from its old site to 
												its present site, to give way to 
												the Owabi head-works. The then 
												Gold Coast Government paid a 
												compensation of £30 to each 
												household for each house lost as 
												a result of the re-location. 
												Unspecified sums of money were 
												also paid as compensation for 
												each farm lost. Plaintiff&nbsp; 
												alleges further that the late 
												Kwabena&nbsp; Asante&nbsp; received the 
												compensation paid for their 
												family house at Ampabame, as 
												well as the&nbsp; unspecified sums of 
												money paid for the&nbsp; cocoa farm 
												of the late Kojo Mosi the then

												Asante as compensation for the

												to the building of the disputed 
												house. The defendants denied the 
												plaintiff&#8217;s capacity and her 
												claim that the house in dispute 
												is her maternal family property. 
												For their part it is their case 
												that no compensation was paid to 
												any household for any house lost 
												and that Kwabena Asante did not 
												receive any compensation on

												therefore commenced the action 
												for recovery of possession and

												agreement he entered into with 
												the respondent and one Quartey

												(hereinafter respondent) 
												commenced an action at the High 
												Court Accra against the Attorney 
												General as 1<sup>st</sup> 
												defendant and the Ghana Football 
												Association as the 2nd defendant 
												(hereinafter applicant) jointly 
												and severally, for the recovery 
												of the sum of ¢422, 148,026 with 
												interest being debt owed in 
												respect of hotel and restaurant 
												services provided by the 
												plaintiff to the Ministry of 
												Education, Youth and Sports and 
												the applicant. The 1<sup>st</sup> 
												defendant entered appearance but 
												failed to file a defence, and 
												the applicant herein did not 
												enter any appearance. On 4 April 
												2006, upon an application by the 
												respondent, the High Court 
												entered judgment against the 
												defendants, jointly and 
												severally, in default of defence 
												and appearance respectively. The 
												respondent took steps to execute 
												the judgment, and then the 
												applicant applied to the High 
												Court to set aside the default 
												judgment on the main ground that 
												it was not liable for the debt, 
												as the understanding was that it 
												was the 1<sup>st</sup> defendant 
												who was to settle the bills. The 
												High Court refused to set aside 
												the judgment. The applicant 
												therefore appealed to the Court 
												of Appeal against this refusal 
												but was again unsuccessful by a 
												judgment dated 22 May2008. The 
												applicant filed an appeal 
												against the judgment of the 
												Court of Appeal and then applied 
												for a stay of execution of the 
												default judgment of the High 
												Court dated 4 April 2006. The 
												Court of Appeal refused the 
												application on the ground that 
												the applicant had not appealed 
												against the said judgment. - <b>

												plaintiff-respondent has raised 
												a preliminary objection to the 
												application, contending that the 
												application &quot;is misconceived as 
												it is not sanctioned by any 
												rules of the Supreme Court.&quot; The 
												facts: In 1991 the plaintiff 
												obtained judgment at the High 
												Court for the sum of 
												¢74,071,000.00 being the balance 
												outstanding on the value of 
												goods sold by the plaintiff to 
												the defendants. The action was 
												initially against the defendants 
												only. The defendants denied the 
												claim and alleged that it was 
												the co-defendants who bought the 
												goods; they therefore joined the 
												co-defendants. The trial High 
												Court's judgment was against the 
												defendants and co-defendants 
												jointly and severally. For 
												various reasons, all the three 
												parties &#8212; the plaintiff, the 
												defendants and the 
												co-defendants-appealed to the 
												Court of Appeal. The Court of 
												Appeal set aside the High Court 
												judgment on grounds that it was 
												against the weight of evidence, 
												and entered judgment against the 
												co-defendants alone as being 
												liable to the plaintiffs claim. 
												The plaintiff and co-defendants 
												appealed to the Supreme Court 
												against that judgment and on 9th 
												May, 2001 the Supreme Court 
												allowed the appeal, set aside 
												the Court of Appeal judgment, 
												and entered judgment for 
												plaintiff against the defendants 
												and absolved the co-defendants 
												from any liability. The court 
												awarded the sum of 
												¢74,071,000.00 against the 
												defendants jointly and severally 
												with interest at the current 
												bank rate from 1st May, 1990 to 
												the date of payment. The 
												Defendants react: The defendants 
												immediately applied for a review 
												of the judgment but did not 
												contest the award of interest in 
												the review.&nbsp; The court dismissed 
												the review application. In 
												answer to the plaintiff&#8217;s

												the defendants contend that they

												- This is an appeal from the

												February 1988. A boundary

												Commission for trial by Mr. 
												Justice F.T.C. Amorin.At the

												stool complied but Effia stool 
												failed to file its survey 
												instructions and offered no

												Commissioner gave judgment 
												wherein he held that:&quot;the 
												evidence led by Fijai stool is 
												more convincing and 
												acceptable..... I am more

												Effia Stool appealed this 
												decision of the Commissioner to 
												the Appeal Tribunal which 
												dismissed the appeal. 
												Dissatisfied the Appellant

												of appeal was &quot;That the judgment 
												is against the weight of

                                                plaintiff. She based her claim 
                                                of ownership of the 212 acres of 
                                                stool land on a gift to her in 
                                                1947 by the reigning chief of 
                                                Awutu Ofaadaa after which she 
                                                performed the necessary rites of

                                                chief for the gift. By the year 
                                                2000 she, her children and

                                                she tendered in evidence. Even

                                                defendant made a grant of a

                                                trend of events, on 5<sup>th</sup> 
                                                February 2001 she caused a writ

                                                Following the death of her

                                                resulted in the total

                                                According to the 1<sup>st</sup>

                                              decision which was substantially 
                                              confirmed on appeal, the only 
                                              variation being a reduction of the

                                              grounds that the damages awarded 
                                              were too punitive and the costs

												Stool Land - Recovery of

												<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">
												Declaration of title to all that 
												land situate, lying and being at 
												New Weija-Accra and containing 
												an approximate area of 95.194 
												acres more or less and bounded 
												on the Northwest by a proposed 
												road measuring 2891.70 feet more 
												or less, on the Northeast by a 
												proposed road measuring 2656.39 
												feet more or less, on the 
												Southeast by Weija lands 
												measuring 1889.36 feet more or 
												less and on the Southwest by 
												Weija lands measuring 2068.55 
												more or less. Plaintiff&#8217;s case 
												is that its Managing Director 
												had acquired a large swathe of 
												land from the Weija stool by way 
												of customary grant in or about 
												1980. He immediately went into 
												possession by clearing the land 
												and erecting boundary 
												pillars.1998, when Plaintiff was 
												incorporated, its Managing 
												Director requested the stool, 
												acting by its Chief Nii Anto 
												Nyame II that the documents in 
												respect of the land be made out 
												in the name of the Plaintiff 
												Company. It is also the case of 
												Plaintiff Company that a 
												cadastral plan prepared by the 
												Government to delineate the 
												precise boundaries of the stool 
												and family lands of Weija 
												clearly defined Plaintiff&#8217;s land 
												in the plan, except it was 
												marked as &#8220;FAK&#8221; instead of &#8220;FKA&#8221; 
												It was Plaintiff&#8217;s further 
												contention that its grantor, the 
												Weija Stool had had its title 
												confirmed in various judgments 
												e.g.&nbsp; Manche Anege Akwei v 
												Manche Kojo Ababio IV (Accra 
												Water Works Acquisition) dated 
												24<sup>th</sup> July 1948 and 
												another judgment of the Full 
												Court dated 1924. Further, that 
												various portions of the land 
												acquired for public use by the 
												then Gold Coast Government paid 
												compensation to the Weija Stool 
												and no one else. Plaintiff says 
												the Defendant has illegally 
												entered onto portions of its 
												land and causing damage and loss 
												to Plaintiff consequently 
												necessitating the Writ and

												The Appellant contended that 
												because of the history of the 
												Fahiakobo lands he was entitled 
												to collect revenues from those 
												lands.&nbsp; This history was in 
												short as follows: historically, 
												in Bekwai the sub-stools are 
												ordinarily in charge of stool 
												land.&nbsp; However, in the case of 
												Fahiakobo, as a result of the 
												settlement of a boundary dispute 
												between two sub-stools of Bekwai 
												over certain lands, it was 
												decided that the Bekwai Stool 
												should take direct charge of the 
												Fahiakobo lands, since these 
												lands constituted a small &#8220;no 
												man&#8217;s land&#8221; between the 
												sub-stools after the demarcation 
												of the boundaries between the 
												two contending sub-stools.&nbsp; The 
												Omanhene therefore administers 
												the lands through an Odikro.&nbsp; 
												The trial Circuit Judge found 
												that the Appellant had conceded 
												that the Fahiakobo lands had not 
												lost their identity as stool 
												lands </span>
												<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial judge held that though 
												the allodial title in the 
												Fahiakobo lands was vested in 
												the Bekwai Stool, the 
												Administration of Stool Lands 
												Act 1962 (Act 123) vested powers 
												of administration of the lands 
												in the Administrator of Stool 
												Lands. On 24<sup>th</sup> August 
												1987, the Appellant was 
												arrainged before His Honour

                                                occupation there of.It was in 
                                                1981 when he approached Nii

                                                (as he then was), for a grant of 
                                                the land from him, but before he 
                                                could succeed in the enterprise, 
                                                he was destooled. In 1986 he

												The facts relevant to this case 
												are that, in the year 1957 Togbe 
												Ayim Darke IV instituted legal 
												action against Togbe Gobo Darke 
												XI of Tsito and one Ntow Peniana, 
												a subject of Tsito, in the Peki 
												Native Court for a declaration 
												of title and damages for 
												trespass to parcels of land 
												known as Awaline Avagah and 
												Tiame. The case was transferred 
												to the High Court, Ho, presided 
												over by Francois J. (as he then 
												was) where the trial commenced 
												before HIM. The High Court gave 
												Judgment in favour of Togbe Ayim 
												Darke IV of Peki on the 11<sup>th</sup> 
												of November 1975. Togbe Gobo 
												Darke XI of Tsito appealed to 
												the Court of Appeal and the 
												Appeal was allowed. There was a 
												further appeal to the Supreme 
												Court which was dismissed. The 
												case appeared to have been 
												legally closed until the 13<sup>th</sup> 
												of July 1987 when Togbe Ayim 
												Darke IV instituted an action in 
												the High Court Accra for a 
												declaration that the Judgement 
												of Francois J in the High Court, 
												Ho, was null and void for want 
												of jurisdiction, and a further 
												order setting aside the 
												Judgement of the Court of Appeal 
												which had affirmed it. It 
												finally applied for an order 
												referring the matter to the 
												Stool Lands boundary Settlement 
												Commission under the Stool Land 
												Boundary Settlement Decree, 1973 
												(NRCD 172). The reliefs were 
												granted by the High Court in 
												Accra, presided over by Omari 
												Sasu J.Togbe Gobo Darke XII and 
												Ntow Peniana of Tsito appealed 
												to the Supreme Court pursuant to 
												leave granted by the Court of 
												Appeal. In the preparation of 
												their case, they run out of time 
												and the case was struck out by 
												the Supreme Court. Togbe Gobo 
												Darke XII then brought an 
												application for certiorari to 
												quash the Judgment of the Accra 
												High Court and all consequential 
												orders made thereunder.&nbsp; The 
												application was granted but it 
												was further ordered that the 
												suit should be sent to the Stool 
												Lands Boundary Settlement 
												Commission.The Awudome stool as 
												overlords of the Tsito stool 
												joined the suit as second 
												claimant . The Peki stool 
												remained the first claimant.

												Counsel for the applicant

												which he had lodged an appeal 
												was non-executable and therefore 
												cannot be stayed. He further

												has no jurisdiction to entertain

												: 1) The Supreme Court has 
												jurisdiction under Article 
												129(4) of the 1992 Constitution 
												and the Courts Act 1993 (Act 
												459) to stay the judgment and 2)

												<b>Review -&nbsp; </b>The review 
												jurisdiction of the Supreme 
												Court has been conferred by 
												Article 133(1) of the 
												Constitution, which reads as 
												follows: &#8212; The Supreme Court may 
												review any decision made or 
												given by it on such grounds and 
												subject to such conditions as 
												may be prescribed by rules of 
												court.&#8221; Pursuant to this 
												provision, Rule 54 of the 
												Supreme Court Rules, 1996 
												(C.I.16) was enacted to regulate 
												the grounds and conditions under 
												which this power may be invoked. 
												Consequently, this Rule provides 
												as follows:&#8212; The Court may 
												review any decision made or 
												given by it on any of the 
												following grounds &#8212; a. 
												exceptional circumstances which 
												have resulted in a miscarriage 
												of justice; b. discovery of new 
												and important matter or evidence 
												which, after the exercise of due 
												diligence, was not within the 
												applicant's knowledge or could 
												not be produced by him at the 
												time when the decision was 
												given&#8221;. (the emphasis is mine) 
												Clearly, the jurisdiction is 
												restricted to the review of 
												decisions &#8220;made or given by it&#8221;; 
												&#8216;it' being with reference to the 
												Supreme Court.&nbsp; Thus, in an 
												application for review, the only 
												decision under scrutiny must be 
												the decision of the Supreme 
												Court, not the decisions of any 
												prior trial or appellate court 
												or tribunal before whom the case 
												had previously appeared. It is 
												for this reason that, time and 
												again, this court has reiterated 
												that its review jurisdiction is 
												not an appellate one and, 
												therefore, an application for 
												review may not be used as an 
												occasion to repeat an appeal or 
												try-on a new appeal. 
												Furthermore, when exercising its 
												review jurisdiction, it is not 
												the function of the Court to 
												second-guess the Ordinary Bench 
												or to substitute its decision 
												for that of the Ordinary Bench, 
												as though the matter before it 
												is yet another appeal.&nbsp; In an 
												application for review, the 
												Court's power and sole function, 
												particularly where the 
												application is founded on the 
												first ground stipulated by Rule 
												54, is to analyse the decision 
												and the reasoning that led 
												thereto, entirely for the 
												purpose of ascertaining whether 
												or not, indeed, there are 
												demonstrably exceptional 
												circumstances which may, indeed, 
												be said to have resulted in a 
												miscarriage of justice.- <b>

												<b>Review -&nbsp; </b>In the decision 
												I have just read, in Opanin Kojo 
												Fori &amp; Others v. Opanin Kofi 
												Adjei &amp; Another, C.M. 6/98, I 
												set out the parameters guiding 
												the exercise of the Supreme 
												Court's review jurisdiction. In 
												the light of the Court's 
												decision in that case, there is 
												no doubt in my mind that the 
												instant application offends 
												against the rules and principles 
												of review. Since the matter 
												before us is an application for 
												review, rather than appeal, the 
												Court's concern is not with 
												whether or not we agree with the 
												decision of the Ordinary Bench 
												of the Court. Rather, what 
												concerns us, and the only 
												consideration which Rule 54 of 
												the Supreme Court Rules, 1996 
												(C.I.16) permits us to take into 
												account, is whether or not there 
												is any proper ground for us to 
												exercise our review 
												jurisdiction. For the purpose of 
												this application, therefore, the 
												question is whether or not the 
												Applicant has demonstrated any 
												exceptional circumstances 
												connected with the decision, 
												which have resulted in a 
												miscarriage of justice. The most 
												cursory study of the judgment 
												against which this applicant has 
												been brought would reveal that 
												the issues raised by Counsel for 
												the Applicants in his Statement 
												of Case herein are, in 
												substance, the same as those 
												raised before the Ordinary 
												Bench, and Counsel's arguments 
												are no more than a rehash of the 
												Applicant's case in the appeal. 
												These issues were extensively 
												considered in both the minority 
												and the leading majority 
												opinions in the judgment. The 
												fact that the applicants might 
												have a preference for the 
												minority views cannot constitute 
												adequate justification for a 
												review of the judgment.- <b>

												<b>Review - </b>This is an 
												application praying this Court 
												to review its judgement given on 
												July 17th, 1999 dismissing the 
												Applicant's appeal. When Rule 54 
												of the Supreme Court Rules, 1996 
												(C.I. 16) was enacted, it was 
												the hope of all that having 
												spelt out, in statutory terms, 
												the only grounds upon which the 
												review jurisdiction of this 
												Court may be exercised, 
												litigants would be duly guided 
												thereby and the previous 
												attempts to use the review 
												jurisdiction as an avenue for a 
												rehearing of lost appeals would 
												cease or, at least, be 
												significantly reduced. 
												Unfortunately this does not 
												appear to be the effect. To make 
												matters worse, it also appears 
												that counsel for losing parties 
												are under the misapprehension 
												that the 'reviewability' of a 
												matter is determined by 
												numerical factors and any 
												decision of the court which is 
												not unanimous must be subject to 
												review. Illustrative of this 
												point is the statement in the 
												Applicant's Statement of Case 
												herein that the application is 
												for:&#8212; &quot;... review of the split 
												decision of the Supreme Court 
												... by a majority of 3-2 ... 
												(and that in this matter) 
												Except... in the National House 
												of Chief where the decision was 
												unanimous in all the other 
												adjudicating bodies which have 
												dealt with this case the 
												decisions have been split, 
												meaning therefore that there may 
												well be very good reasons for 
												reviewing the majority decision 
												of the Supreme Court - <b>

												<b>Review - </b>On July 14th 
												1999, this Court, by a majority 
												decision, dismissed an 
												application, brought by the 
												applicant herein, for the 
												attachment of the 16 Respondents 
												herein for contempt of court. By 
												the instant application, the 
												applicant prays this Court to 
												review its said decision upon 
												the ground that the decision has 
												&#8216;occasioned a grave miscarriage 
												of justice and therefore it is 
												in the interest of justice that 
												the ruling be reviewed'. 
												According to the Statement of 
												Case filed on behalf of the 
												applicant, this contention is 
												based on two grounds, namely 
												that: -1. &quot;the Ruling was given 
												per incuriam for failure to 
												consider the case law and 
												statute law relevant to the 
												application&quot;, and&nbsp; 2. &quot;the 
												applicant's case was not 
												adequately considered.&quot; The 
												power of this Court to review 
												its decisions is governed by 
												Rule 54 of the Supreme Court 
												Rules, 1996 (C.I.16), which 
												stipulates the only grounds upon 
												which we may exercise that 
												power. These grounds are very 
												well known to any assiduous 
												practitioner, however, for ease 
												of reference we set them out in 
												full as follows:&#8212; &#8220;(a) 
												exceptional circumstances which 
												have resulted in a miscarriage 
												of justice;&nbsp; (b) discovery of 
												new and important matter or 
												evidence which, after the 
												exercise of due diligence, was 
												not within the applicant's 
												knowledge or could not be 
												produced by him at the time when 
												the decision was given.&quot; In 
												effect, these limited grounds 
												are no different from those 
												previously prescribed when the 
												power of review was not 
												statutory but, rather, premised 
												on the inherent jurisdiction of 
												the Court. It has been held time 
												and again that the review 
												process must never be viewed or 
												used as a devise for a rehearing 
												of the applicant's case. 
												Therefore, the case of the 
												applicant, in support of an 
												application for review, must 
												clearly establish factors that 
												would justify the application 
												under either of the stipulated 
												grounds.- <b>

												few years before his death Mr 
												Agyekum was taken ill and he 
												spared no effort to regain his 
												health. At this time he appeared 
												to have only one wife, Madam 
												Elizabeth Twene. Her children 
												are the youngest among the 
												deceased&#8217;s children. Mr Agyekum 
												sought treatment in Ghana, 
												Germany and England. He even 
												attended at traditional healers 
												in Ghana and elsewhere, all to 
												no avail. He was accompanied by 
												Madam Elizabeth Twene. 
												Eventually he returned to Ghana 
												on 21<sup>st</sup> May 1985, a 
												very sick man. It was the 
												Respondents&#8217; case in the High 
												Court and of course, throughout 
												these appeals that the deceased 
												suspected the end was near and 
												decided to put his worldly 
												affairs in order. They pleaded 
												that the deceased asked that his 
												solicitor be fetched. His 
												solicitor was Major Brown, a 
												well-known solicitor of the firm 
												of Quist, Brown, Aidoo, Wontumi 
												&amp; Co. The Respondents statement 
												of Defence stated that at the 
												deceased&#8217;s request Major Brown 
												took instructions from him and 
												prepared a will for him which 
												was &#8220;duly executed by him as 
												provided by law.&#8221; Mr Agyekum 
												died on 3<sup>rd</sup> 
												September, 1985. In due course, 
												his will was read at the High 
												Court, Accra. When the Will was 
												read, a number of disappointed 
												beneficiaries took umbrage at 
												its contents so when the 
												executors applied to the High 
												Court for the Will to be proved 
												in common form for it to be 
												admitted to probate, this was 
												opposed by a section of 
												deceased&#8217;s children who promptly 
												filed a caveat against the 
												grant. Ultimately, the 
												Appellants (as Plaintiffs) 
												issued a writ of Summons in the 
												High court, Accra, on 10<sup>th</sup> 
												February 1986 against the 
												executors, Robert Adjan Tackie 
												and Major Brown, claiming:-A 
												declaration that the last will 
												and Testament of William Davies 
												Agyekum deceased, is invalid and 
												of no legal effect and should 
												therefore be set aside.An 
												injunction to restrain the Defs 
												and beneficiaries and/or their 
												assigns, agents and servants 
												from interfering in anyway 
												whatsoever with the properties 
												named in the Will.&#8221;The 
												Respondents (then defendants) 
												denied the averment that the 
												testator&#8217;s will was invalid and 
												pleaded in considerable detail 
												how the will came to be signed 
												by the testator, and who were 
												his attesting witnesses. They 
												counterclaimed against the 
												Plaintiffs jointly and severally 
												for:- A declaration that the 
												paper writing dated 5<sup>th</sup> 
												July 1985 signed by the deceased 
												and witnessed by two attesting 
												witnesses is the deceased&#8217;s 
												&#8220;Last Will and Testament&#8221; and 
												that therefore the Defendants 
												are the Executors thereof. An 
												Order that the said Paper 
												Writing be admitted to Probate.

line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"> The

												(hereinafter &#8220;the respondents&#8221;) 
												as executors. Upon Bremansu&#8217;s

												Thomas Kobina Barimansu granted 
												to the defendants be called in 
												and executors for want of 
												interest and for dissipating the 
												estate.&#8221;&nbsp; The respondents

												order setting aside the alleged 
												will of the deceased dated 22<sup>nd</sup> 
												day of February, 1997 on the 
												grounds that it is not the deed

												&nbsp;<b>Wills -</b> <b>Letters of

												The simple facts of the case are 
												that House No. O.T.77 Kumasi was 
												built by one Madam Afua Mensah, 
												who had two children namely 
												Elizabeth Victoria Mensah and 
												Daniel Owusu. During Madam Afua 
												Mensah's lifetime she sold half 
												of the house to one A.D. 
												Agboloso. After the sale the 
												house was numbered as O.T. 77A 
												and O.T.77B and Afua Mensah 
												retained that part numbered O.T. 
												77A.&nbsp; Madam Afua Mensah died in 
												1950 leaving a will which was 
												tendered in evidence and marked 
												Exhibit &quot;B&quot;. In the will she 
												bequeathed to her son Daniel 
												Owusu and he daughter, Elizabeth 
												Victoria Mensah her portion of 
												the said house. In par 2 of Exh. 
												'B' the Will she said as 
												follows:­The defendants in the 
												case are the children of Daniel 
												Owusu namely Dina Owusu and 
												Daniel Owusu. After the death of 
												Daniel Owusu's mother i.e Afua 
												Mensah he lived in the house 
												with his wife and children. When 
												Daniel Owusu also died in 1959 
												intestate, he was succeeded by 
												his uterine sister Elizabeth 
												Victoria Mausah PW1. The latter 
												obtained Letters of 
												Administration in respect of the 
												estate of her deceased brother 
												and also a lease in respect of 
												the house. She also took steps 
												to have the ownership of the 
												house changed into her name at 
												the Kumasi City Council.&nbsp; When 
												Daniel Owusu died his children 
												i.e. the defendants were too 
												young and so left to live with 
												relatives, but after 16 years 
												they returned to live in their 
												father's house and occupied two 
												rooms which their father had 
												occupied in his lifetime rent 
												free.In 1984 the plaintiff Madam 
												Akosua Agyentoa bought the whole 
												house from Elizabeth Victoria 
												Mensah PW1, who had perfected 
												her title document on the House. 
												After the sale Madam Akosua 
												Agyentoa the Plaintiff took 
												action against the Owusu's 
												children for recovery of 
												possession of the said rooms. 
												Judgment was given in her favour 
												at the District Court and the 
												defendants were ordered to 
												vacate the rooms forthwith.&nbsp; An 
												Appeal to the High Court by the 
												Defendants against the judgment 
												of the lower Court was 
												confirmed. Dissatisfied the 
												Defendants again appealed to the 
												Court of Appeal which court 
												party allowed the Appeal, in a 
												unanimous decision of the Appeal 
												Court. Then the appellant herein 
												also appealed to the Supreme 
												Court. - <b>

												one Kwadwo Kwako, the appellant 
												herein. The testator in clause 7 
												of will devised six rooms in 
												House No. 54 Block 12 to the 
												appellant. Then in clause 13 of 
												the will the testator declared 
												that:Kwadwo Kwako is to inherit 
												me on my death and all the 
												properties which I have not 
												devised must go to him&quot;The 
												Plaintiff/Respondent hereinafter 
												referred to simply as the 
												respondent did not receive any 
												gift under the will. On 7th 
												February, 1991 the respondent 
												describing himself as &quot;one of 
												the principal members of the 
												Bretuo Family or clan of Kenkase-Ashanti 
												and a beneficiary under the late 
												Isaac Ottie's said Will and who 
												claims to be interested in the 
												Residuary Estate of the said 
												Isaac Ottie&quot; (deceased) took out 
												an originating summons at the 
												High Court in Kumasi asking for 
												an interpretation of clause 13 
												of the Will, quoted above. In 
												his opinion the devise to the 
												appellant in clause 13 of the 
												Will was made to him in his 
												capacity as customary successor 
												and therefore the appellant must 
												be deemed to take such 
												properties in trust for his 
												immediate family. The question 
												he posed for determination as 
												follows:&#8212; &quot;Whether or not having 
												regard to the devises in the 
												last will of Isaac Ottie, alias 
												Agya Atta (decd) dated 26th 
												January, 1982, more particularly 
												the devises made in clauses 7 
												and 13 of the said Will the late 
												Testator Isaac Ottie by clause 
												13 of the said will devised his 
												Residual Estate to Kwadwo Kwako 
												personally forever or the devise 
												was made to Kwadwo Kwako in his 
												capacity as the customary 
												successor who is to hold the 
												properties in trust for his 
												immediate family - <b>

												On 2 December 1986, one Moses

												Dr. John Ackah Blay-Miezah died

												June 1992 leaving behind a wife 
												and fourteen children, including 
												minors.&nbsp; After his burial, it 
												came to the knowledge of this 
												family that he had left behind a 
												Will deposited in some banks in 
												Switzerland. The family 
												therefore decided that his 
												widow, Mrs. Joyce Blay-Miezah 
												and the head of the family, Nana 
												Asemda should apply for Letters 
												of Administration (L/A) to 
												enable them retrieve this Will 
												from Switzerland.&nbsp; An 
												application for L/A was 
												accordingly filed at the Accra 
												High Court and granted to Mrs. 
												Joyce Blay-Miezah and Nana 
												Asemda on 22nd January 1993. 
												Subsequently, Mr. 
												Adumuah-Bossman applied on 
												behalf of Dr. John Robert Kells 
												and the same Nana Asemda, for 
												probate in respect of a Will 
												allegedly made by Dr. 
												Blay-Miezah on 29th January 1989 
												(the 1989 Will). Once the L/A in 
												respect of the same estate was 
												subsisting, the application for 
												probate was naturally refused. 
												In due course, a copy of the 
												Will deposited in Switzerland, 
												had been obtained and deposited 
												at the Accra High Court.&nbsp; It is 
												dated 8th May 1988 and would 
												hereinafter be referred to as 
												the 1988 Will.&nbsp; Dr. Ako Adjei 
												and Francis K. Mensah sought an 
												application for probate of this 
												Will, but it was caveated.In the 
												interim, a second application 
												for probate of the 1989 Will was 
												made by Dr. John Kells and 
												Joseph Whaja.&nbsp; Francis K. Mensah, 
												Nana Asemda, Roxana Kim 
												Blay-Miezah and Francis Kolorah 
												Blay-Miezah lodged caveats to 
												this application. The last two 
												being the eldest female and male 
												children of the late Dr. 
												Blay-Miezah.&nbsp; All the four 
												caveators contended that the 
												1989 Will was a forgery. 
												Consequently the applicants for 
												probate of the 1989 Will, Dr. 
												John Kells and Joseph Whajah 
												issued the Writ in this appeal,

												The late Amos Thomas Yalley of 
												the Ebiradze Family of Amanful 
												had in his Will disposed of 
												Houses Nos. 27/2 Ahanta Road and 
												58/2 Summer Road, all at 
												Takoradi to his son Amos Thomas 
												Yalley, Jnr., the defendant in 
												the action. The plaintiffs, the 
												head and member respectively of 
												the same family claimed that the 
												dispositions to the defendant 
												were unlawful as those 
												properties belonged to the 
												family. A dispute having thus 
												arisen over the issue, the 
												family sought a declaration from 
												the High Court that the 
												properties were family 
												properties: They prayed further 
												for an order &#8216;detaching&#8217; the 
												properties from the estate of 
												the deceased. It should be noted 
												that in an earlier abortive 
												appeal at the Court of Appeal, 
												the defendant had conceded that 
												House No. 58/2 Summer Road, 
												Takoradi was a family property. 
												Consequently, the Court in 
												ordering a re-trial, had 
												confined the hearing only to 
												House No. 27/2 Ahanta Road, 
												Takoradi. In the ensuing trial, 
												the High Court gave judgment for 
												the plaintiff declaring House 
												No. 27/2 Ahanta Road, Takoradi 
												as family property. It said the 
												late Amos Thomas Yalley had no 
												testamentary capacity to dispose 
												of it to his son, the defendant. 
												The defendant appealed against 
												this decision to the Court of 
												Appeal which dismissed the 
												appeal and affirmed the judgment 
												of the Court below. Still 
												dissatisfied, the defendant 
												appealed to this Court. On 
												23/2/2000 we unanimously 
												dismissed the appeal. The main 
												issue which arose for 
												determination in the case was 
												whether or not the house was a 
												family property and if so 
												whether the late Amos Thomas 
												Yalley could dispose of it to 
												his son in his Will as if it 
												were his personal property.- <b>

												Vocational Institute 
												(hereinafter referred to as the 
												Institute) was owned by Mrs. 
												Rosamund Mancell who died 
												testate on 14 August 1987. She 
												bequeathed the Institute to her 
												five children. After the 
												necessary probate had been 
												taken, vesting assent was given 
												to the children. One of the 
												children was Elizabeth Mansa 
												Mancell. She died in 1993, 
												leaving behind three children by 
												name Josephine Akita, Francisca 
												Hammond and Ronald Renee. The 
												three children took over the 
												interest of Elizabeth Mansa 
												Mancell in the estate. In this 
												application, Josephine Akita 
												describes herself as the 
												applicant, the administratrix of 
												the estate of the deceased 
												Elizabeth Mansa Mancell and 
												representative of herself and 
												the two children (as appearing 
												in the suit she brought earlier 
												in the High Court). In December 
												2008, the applicant took action 
												in the Human Rights Division of 
												the High Court to nullify the 
												sale for the sole reason that it 
												was concluded without the 
												knowledge and consent of the 
												children of the deceased 
												Elizabeth Mansa Mancell -<a href="2010/THE%20REPUBLIC%20%20HIGH%20COURT,%20HUMAH%20RIGHTS%20DIV.%20ACCRA%20%20EX-PARTE%20.htm">
