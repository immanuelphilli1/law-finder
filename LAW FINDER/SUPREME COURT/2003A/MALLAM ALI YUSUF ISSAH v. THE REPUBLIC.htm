												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Appellant is the former 
												Minister of Youth and Sports. On 
												20th July 2001, the High Court 
												convicted him on two counts of 
												stealing and fraudulently 
												causing the financial loss of 
												$46,000.00 to the State contrary 
												to sections 124(1) and 
												179A(3)(a), respectively, of the 
												Criminal Code, 1960 (Act 29). 
												The High Court sentenced him to 
												serve 4 years in jail on each 
												count plus a fine of 
												¢10,000,000.00 or, in default, 
												12 months in jail on count two. 
												Additionally, the Appellant was 
												ordered to refund the amount of 
												$46,000.00 or, in default, serve 
												an additional jail term of 2 
												years. All the sentences were to 
												run concurrently. The Appellant 
												appealed to the Court of Appeal 
												against both the conviction and 
												the sentences. On October 23rd 
												2001, the Court of Appeal gave 
												judgment upholding the 
												conviction and, therefore, 
												dismissed the appeal. However, 
												the court varied the sentences 
												by quashing the 2 years' jail 
												sentence imposed in default of 
												making the refund ordered by the 
												High Court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Appellant by his appeal 
												herein challenges the Court of 
												Appeal's confirmation of the 
												conviction and the remaining 
												sentences. The Notice of Appeal 
												sets out 9 grounds of appeal, 
												which may be summed up as 
												follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												1. The confirmation of the 
												conviction of the Appellant on 
												the two counts cannot be 
												supported by the evidence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2. The Court of Appeal erred 
												when it failed to evaluate the 
												evidence in accordance with the 
												law regarding circumstantial 
												evidence (grounds 2 and 3).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3. The Court of Appeal erred 
												when it failed to determine 
												whether, with regard to the 
												evidence of the prosecution 
												before the High Court, the 
												requisite standard of proof had 
												been satisfied.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												4. The Court of Appeal erred 
												when it held that the Appellant 
												had failed to prove that he had 
												been framed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												5. The Court of Appeal erred 
												when it confirmed that the 
												Appellant's former bodyguard was 
												not a vital witness and 
												therefore the failure by the 
												prosecution to call him was not 
												fatal to the prosecution of the 
												Appellant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												6. The Court of Appeal erred 
												when it ignored the Learned 
												Trial Judge's statement, which 
												raised the Appellant's burden of 
												proof to one beyond reasonable 
												doubt.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												7. The sentence to refund the 
												missing amount having been 
												declared to be enforceable by 
												civil action, the remaining 
												sentences of 4 years on each 
												count are too harsh.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												8. The manner in which the trial 
												of the Appellant was conducted 
												by the High Court deprived the 
												Appellant of and/or infringed 
												his fundamental human right to a 
												fair trial under Article 19 of 
												the Constitution.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												At the hearing of this appeal, 
												we drew the attention of counsel 
												for the Appellant to the 
												interlocutory appeal in which he 
												had raised the issue as to the 
												constitutionality of the charge 
												brought against the Appellant in 
												count two. Counsel's reply was 
												that, once an appeal is by way 
												of a rehearing, the Court of 
												Appeal's decision on the 
												constitutionality of the charge, 
												together with its decision on 
												all other issues, are all before 
												us. He, therefore, invited us to 
												consider all of the record 
												before us.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Section 31 (1) of the Courts 
												Act, 1993 (Act 459) provides as 
												follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Subject to subsection (2) of 
												this section, an appellate court 
												on hearing any appeal before it 
												in a criminal case shall allow 
												the appeal if it considers that 
												the verdict or conviction or 
												acquittal ought to be set aside 
												on the ground that it is 
												unreasonable or cannot be 
												supported having regard to the 
												evidence or that the judgment in 
												question ought to be set aside 
												on the ground of a wrong 
												decision of any question of law 
												or fact or that on any ground 
												there was a miscarriage of 
												justice and in any other case 
												shall dismiss the appeal.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Subsection (2), to which 
												subsection (1) is made subject, 
												requires the appellate court to 
												dismiss an appeal if it 
												considers that there has, 
												actually, been no substantial 
												miscarriage of justice or that 
												the point made by the appeal 
												consists of a technicality or 
												procedural error or a defect in 
												the charge or indictment but 
												that there is evidence to 
												support the alleged offence in 
												the statement of offence. From 
												the grounds of appeal, the 
												Appellant is saying that his 
												conviction cannot be supported 
												having regard to the evidence 
												and that, in any event, the 
												sentence is too harsh. He is 
												also saying that he has been 
												denied his constitutional right 
												to a fair trial.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Regarding the evidence, we have 
												reviewed the entire record of 
												proceedings and have no doubt 
												that the Appellant's conviction, 
												as well as the confirmation 
												thereof by the Court of Appeal 
												and the respective reasons, 
												given by the learned Justices of 
												Appeal for their conclusions, 
												are amply supported by the 
												evidence adduced by the 
												prosecution. Furthermore, this 
												is an appeal from concurrent 
												decisions of the courts below, 
												i.e. the High Court and the 
												Court of Appeal. That being so, 
												it was the duty of the Appellant 
												to demonstrate to this court 
												that the conclusions of the 
												trial court and the Court of 
												Appeal were not based on the 
												evidence on record or that, on 
												the totality of the evidence, 
												the charges against him had not 
												been proven beyond reasonable 
												doubt. This, the Appellant, in 
												our view, has failed to do.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Before moving on to the question 
												of whether the proceedings in 
												the High Court in any way 
												infringed upon the Appellant's 
												right to a fair trial, there is 
												the need to consider whether, 
												regardless of the foregoing, the 
												trial judge assigned to the 
												Appellant a higher burden of 
												proof than that required by the 
												law. To deal with this question, 
												there is the need to take a 
												close look at the provisions of 
												the Evidence Decree, 1975 (NRCD 
												323), relating to the burden of 
												proof on an accused person in a 
												criminal trial. These provisions 
												start off in section 10 with a 
												definition of the burden of 
												persuasion as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;(1)&nbsp; For the purposes of this 
												Decree, the burden of persuasion 
												means the obligation of a party 
												to establish a requisite degree 
												of belief concerning a fact in 
												the mind of the tribunal of fact 
												or the court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) The burden of persuasion may 
												require a party to raise a 
												reasonable doubt concerning the 
												existence or non-existence of a 
												fact or that he establish the 
												existence or non-existence of a 
												fact by a preponderance of 
												probabilities or by proof beyond 
												a reasonable doubt.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Section 11 (1) and (3) state 
												that:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;(1) For the purposes of this 
												Decree, the burden of producing 
												evidence means the obligation of 
												a party to introduce sufficient 
												evidence to avoid a ruling 
												against him on the issue.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;(3) In a criminal action, the 
												burden of producing evidence, 
												when it is on the accused as to 
												any fact the converse of which 
												is essential to guilt, requires 
												the accused to produce 
												sufficient evidence so that on 
												all the evidence a reasonable 
												mind could have a reasonable 
												doubt as to guilt.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Section 13(2) also provides 
												that:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Except as provided in section 
												15(3), in a criminal action the 
												burden of persuasion, when it is 
												on the accused as to any fact 
												the converse of which is 
												essential to guilt, requires 
												only that the accused raise a 
												reasonable doubt as to guilt.'</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												And finally, in section 14, it 
												is provided that:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Except as provided by law, 
												unless and until it is shifted, 
												a party has the burden of 
												persuasion as to each fact the 
												existence or non-existence of 
												which is essential to the claim 
												or defence he is asserting.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Taken together, the burden of 
												producing evidence and the 
												burden of persuasion are the 
												components of 'the burden of 
												proof.' Thus, although an 
												accused person is not required 
												to prove his innocence, during 
												the course of his trial, he may 
												run a risk of non-production of 
												evidence and/or non-persuasion 
												to the required degree of 
												belief, particularly when he is 
												called upon to mount a defence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												According to counsel for the 
												Appellant, the trial court set a 
												higher standard than that 
												legally required of the 
												Appellant when, in the course of 
												his judgment, he expressed 
												himself as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;This court was treated to a 
												revelation of a litany of 
												misdeeds at the Ministry of 
												Youth and Sports, many of which 
												were unravelled during the short 
												tenure of office of the accused. 
												For example, the accused had 
												cause to castigate the Ag. Chief 
												Director for being incompetent 
												on one or two occasions. . . .</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;For all this, the accused said 
												he had been framed up with the 
												story of he having stolen the 
												$46,000.00. I must say that most 
												of the above were admitted by 
												the prosecution witnesses, but 
												it was not enough to say that 
												the accused was framed up. The 
												accused should have also shown 
												how as result of the hostility 
												to him in his office, all those 
												persons or some of them, either 
												by themselves or their agents, 
												privies, workmen or assigns and 
												confederates took the money away 
												from him. He should also have 
												shown how the money was taken 
												from his suitcase by or on the 
												plane or elsewhere. Nothing of 
												the sort was shown by him. 
												Beyond merely making these 
												allegations, he provided no 
												concrete of substance of any 
												evidence to buttress his point. 
												When the onus shifts unto the 
												accused to raise reasonable 
												doubts in the story of the 
												prosecution, the story of the 
												accused must indeed go beyond 
												what is nothing but fanciful 
												fiction and mere suppositions. 
												This, the accused in my 
												estimation from his otherwise 
												long and verbose evidence, 
												failed to do. Whilst I 
												disbelieve his evidence, I do 
												not believe it to be reasonably 
												probable either. In the result I 
												state that his evidence did not 
												meet the case of the 
												prosecution.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												When counsel for the Appellant 
												raised this point before the 
												Court of Appeal, the Court, per 
												Gbadegbe, JA., concluded that, 
												when read with the entirety of 
												the judgment, it is clear that 
												the trial judge had properly 
												directed his mind to the 
												relevant burden of proof, and 
												therefore, that portion of the 
												judgment could not have amounted 
												to a miscarriage of justice 
												within the contemplation of 
												section 31 of the Courts Act. We 
												do not believe that the Court of 
												Appeal erred in arriving at this 
												conclusion. Admittedly, there 
												was no burden on the Appellant 
												to show how the money got 
												missing. However, we are not 
												convinced that that expression 
												alone, on the part of the Trial 
												Judge, is such as to amount to 
												his misdirecting himself on the 
												law and thereby causing a 
												miscarriage of justice. The 
												Appellant had a burden of 
												producing evidence sufficient 
												enough, in the light of the 
												totality of the evidence, to 
												raise, in the judge's mind, a 
												reasonable doubt as to his 
												having appropriated the money. 
												The Learned Trial Judge declared 
												himself unpersuaded by the 
												evidence produced by the 
												Appellant to buttress the 
												assertion in his defence that he 
												had been framed, and we have not 
												been shown any reason why we 
												should find otherwise.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Turning now to ground 9, which 
												raises the issue of whether or 
												not the trial court conducted 
												the trial of the Appellant in 
												such a manner as to deprive him 
												of or infringe upon his 
												fundamental and constitutional 
												right to a fair trial under 
												article 19, counsel for the 
												Appellant, under this ground, 
												particularised the instances 
												that, in his view, give rise to 
												this ground as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												a. &quot;The Fast Track High Court, 
												Accra refused to stay 
												proceedings for the Supreme 
												Court, Accra to determine an 
												appeal against the dismissal of 
												a submission of no case to 
												answer and the constitutionality 
												of the second charge against the 
												Appellant... and in fact stated 
												that only an express order of 
												the Supreme Court Accra and not 
												the pendency of an application 
												before the Supreme Court Accra 
												for a stay of proceedings is 
												adequate to stay proceedings 
												before it.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												b. &quot;That the Fast Track High 
												Court, Accra refused the 
												Appellant's applications for 
												necessary adjournments to enable 
												counsel for the Appellant to 
												facilitate the preparation of 
												Appellant's defence/case in 
												consonance with his right under 
												Article 19 of the 
												Constitution....</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												c. &quot;That the Appellant's right 
												of appeal under the 1992 
												Constitution ... has been 
												hampered by high fees peculiar 
												to the Fast Track High Court 
												system which raises an issue of 
												jurisdiction namely whether the 
												fast Track High Court is in 
												substance a High Court 
												simpliciter.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The grant or refusal of an 
												application for an Order of Stay 
												of Proceedings is entirely 
												within the discretion of the 
												court. As with all such 
												discretions, it must be 
												exercised judicially, not 
												whimsically or capriciously. The 
												mere fact of the pendency of an 
												interlocutory appeal does not 
												necessarily justify, or compel, 
												the exercise of the discretion 
												by a trial judge. The 
												circumstances of the particular 
												case must be taken into account 
												and such circumstances must 
												include some special 
												circumstances. In this case, the 
												learned High Court judge gave 
												copious reasons and based 
												himself on decided cases, for 
												his refusal to stay the 
												proceedings. As he noted, at 
												page 14 of Volume 2 of the 
												Record of Appeal:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;In the instant case, if the 
												trial goes on and the Supreme 
												Court allows the appeal filed by 
												the accused, the trial will 
												automatically be halted and the 
												accused will earn his freedom. 
												If it is over by then, he would 
												be acquitted and discharged on 
												both counts. Also the accused 
												will have the decision quashed 
												by certiorari or set aside by 
												appeal. No irretrievable harm 
												will be caused to the accused 
												then.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;I do not lose sight of the fact 
												that the Court of Appeal has 
												ruled that the accused has a 
												case to answer on both counts as 
												the evidence supports them and a 
												prima facie case has been made 
												out against the accused.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the course of moving his 
												application for Stay of 
												Proceedings, counsel for the 
												Appellant had, as he has done in 
												his written submissions before 
												us, relied on this court's 
												decision in British Airways v. 
												The Attorney General, [1996-97] 
												SCGLR 547. The learned judge, 
												however, distinguished 
												(correctly in our view), that 
												case from the circumstances 
												surrounding the application 
												before him. We consider that the 
												trial judge had sound reasons 
												for refusing the application and 
												that, in refusing to exercise 
												his discretion in the matter, he 
												acted judicially and did not 
												deny to the Appellant his right 
												to fair trial, nor did he 
												infringe upon such right.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Likewise, adjournments are 
												within the sole discretion of 
												the court and the mere refusal 
												by a judge to grant the 
												Appellant's applications for 
												adjournments cannot, of itself, 
												constitute a denial of the right 
												to a fair trial, particularly 
												where the peculiar circumstances 
												of the court were such that it 
												was possible to produce 
												transcripts of the records of 
												the previous day's proceedings 
												within a matter of hours.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As to the third particular, this 
												court has, by its ruling dated 
												June 26th 2002, in CM 11/2002, 
												Tsikata v. the Attorney General, 
												now placed it beyond any further 
												debate that the Fast Track Court 
												is part of the High Court. The 
												higher fees charged thereat are 
												justified because of the court's 
												technical mode of operation and 
												cannot form the basis of a 
												conclusion that such fees amount 
												to a denial of the Appellant's 
												constitutional right to a fair 
												trial.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Finally, and with regard to the 
												sentences, as varied by the 
												Court of Appeal, counsel for the 
												Appellant submitted that, taking 
												into account the peculiar 
												circumstances of the case, the 
												custodial sentences be waived. 
												These special circumstances, 
												according counsel are that:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												1. The Appellant was in office 
												as a Minister for only 30 days 
												and received no remuneration for 
												his services.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2. The Appellant admitted 
												responsibility for the loss of 
												the $46,000.00 and offered to 
												refund the same by instalments.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3. The Appellant's commitment to 
												refund the said amount was 
												constrained by the law in view 
												of the offences charged and his 
												plea of &quot;not guilty&quot; to the 
												charges.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												4. The Appellant can only make 
												good his offer to refund the 
												amount if he is involved in 
												activities that yield earnings, 
												therefore incarceration will 
												damage is capacity to make the 
												refund.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is quite clear from the 
												record that the Appellant did, 
												indeed, offer to make the refund 
												in instalments, both during the 
												investigation of the loss and in 
												the course of the trial. However 
												the law on the matter is quite 
												clear. Section 35 of the Courts 
												Act sets out the parameters and 
												consequences where an accused or 
												convicted person offers 
												compensation or restitution. The 
												section requires that such an 
												accused person must first admit 
												the offence and then offer 
												compensation or make restitution 
												and reparation for the loss, 
												harm or damage, whereupon the 
												court shall proceed to accept a 
												guilty plea from the accused and 
												convict him on his own plea. In 
												such event, the Court may, in 
												lieu of passing sentence on the 
												accused, make an order for him 
												to pay compensation or make 
												restitution and reparation, 
												subject to such conditions as 
												the court may direct. This is 
												the import of subsections (1) to 
												(4) of the said section 35. 
												Admittedly, modern jurisprudence 
												frowns on custodial sentences 
												and considers restorative 
												justice more beneficial and 
												economical to the society. 
												Furthermore, the current trend 
												in the administration of 
												criminal justice is to encourage 
												more recourse to civil remedies 
												where such are available for 
												actions that constitute both 
												civil and criminal offences. In 
												this case, the State, 
												unfortunately for Appellant, 
												opted to bring criminal charges, 
												rather than civil claims, 
												against him; that being so, we 
												cannot bypass the clear 
												provisions of Act 459, s. 35. 
												The Appellant did indeed offer 
												to refund the money, however he 
												did not plead guilty to the 
												offence charged. Consequently, 
												we cannot waive the sentence 
												simply because he has offered to 
												refund the missing amount. In 
												the circumstances, the custodial 
												sentence is lawful, as has been 
												admitted by counsel for the 
												Appellant, and in order. We, 
												therefore, see no reason to 
												waive it.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In coming to the foregoing 
												conclusions, we would state 
												that, in a nutshell, we have 
												taken into consideration all the 
												proceedings in this case and all 
												papers filed on behalf of the 
												parties, including interlocutory 
												proceedings, the grounds of 
												appeal filed and everything laid 
												before this court and we have 
												determined that:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												a.&nbsp; The charge based on the 
												Criminal Code, (Act 29) as 
												amended, i.e. section 179A 
												(3)(a), is constitutional and 
												has been legitimately laid under 
												the Criminal Code. The charge 
												and the provisions under which 
												it was brought have in no way 
												violated the provisions of 
												article 19 of the Constitution. 
												We adopt fully, the reasons and 
												opinions of the Justices of the 
												Court of Appeal, Brobbey, Baddoo 
												and Amonoo-Monney, JJA, dated 
												June 26th 2001, in CRA 22/2001 
												and affirm the same.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												b.&nbsp; On the facts and evidence 
												brought, we are satisfied that 
												they support the conclusions 
												arrived at by both the trial and 
												appellate courts of justice and 
												we confirm them. As to both the 
												conviction and the sentence, 
												none of the grounds of appeal 
												filed on behalf of the Appellant 
												has succeeded in persuading us 
												to hold otherwise.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The entire appeal is hereby 
												dismissed.</span></p>
