												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												MRS. WOOD, J.S.C.:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellant, who was employed 
												by the respondent company as a 
												mine operator, was subsequently 
												diagnosed with a cardiac disease 
												and therefore retired on medical 
												grounds.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Contending that his illness was 
												occupational, in that it 
												developed by reason of his work 
												schedule as a heavy machine 
												operator, he sued to recover 
												what he thought he was entitled 
												to under the section (c) of 
												Article 11.09 of the Collective 
												Bargaining Agreement (CBA), 
												together with interest thereon.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Both the trial High Court and 
												the Appeal Court, to which the 
												respondents who, was clearly 
												dissatisfied with the original 
												decision turned to for redress, 
												rightly in my view, identified 
												only one key issue for 
												determination. It was this: 
												Whether or not the appellants 
												medical condition was work 
												related, or to put it in the 
												language of the CBA, an 
												occupational ill-health.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial court gave an 
												affirmative answer to this 
												question and consequently 
												awarded him ¢12 million as 
												damages. The Court of Appeal 
												upon a very critical examination 
												of the available evidence, 
												particularly exhibit C and E, 
												concluded otherwise, reversed 
												this critical finding and set 
												aside the decision and the award 
												made thereunder.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Obviously dissatisfied with this 
												reversal, the appellant has 
												understandably appealed to us on 
												a sole ground, in spite of the 
												clear advance notice that 
												further grounds would be filed 
												on receipt of the record of 
												proceedings.&nbsp; The ground reads 
												as follows:-</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The Court of Appeal erred in 
												the interpretation of Exhibits 
												&#8220;C&#8221; and &#8220;E&#8221; in holding that the 
												appellants condition was not 
												occupational&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It follows that this appeal 
												turns on the same narrow, 
												primary and fundamental issue of 
												whether or not his ill-health 
												was occupational. The importance 
												of this question is not 
												difficult to fathom. An 
												affirmative answer would, under 
												the contract of employment, 
												entitle him to 20 months of his 
												basic salary, rather than the 
												relatively paltry sum of 4 
												months salary which was offered 
												him, by the respondents as his 
												true and just terminal benefit.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Two simple arguments were 
												advanced in support of this sole 
												ground of appeal. At the trial, 
												the court had found that a pre 
												employment medical examination 
												of the appellant, had disclosed 
												no tell tale signs of any such 
												malady and had therefore 
												inferred from the Exhibit E, the 
												medical report, that his 
												subsequent ill health was 
												occupational, which finding 
												which the appellate court 
												reversed. It was therefore 
												submitted in this court, that 
												the proper inference to be drawn 
												from the Exhibit E was that 
												which was made by the learned 
												trial judge, namely that his 
												condition was as a result of his 
												employment with GAG, in other 
												words that his illness is 
												occupational. We have therefore 
												been urged to revert to this 
												finding in view of the contents 
												of Exhibit E.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												However, it was urged in the 
												alternative that we ought not to 
												overlook the contributory role 
												of the occupation in the 
												development of the disease and 
												were invited to rule positively 
												to that effect. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I have not the slightest 
												difficulty in dismissing this 
												later alternate argument on the 
												contributory role of his work 
												schedule i.e operating heavy 
												equipment.&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The action was not premised on 
												this fact and therefore, this 
												case was not fought along these 
												lines also. The issue therefore 
												never arose for the courts 
												consideration. The following 
												extract from his pleadings, 
												discloses the lines along which 
												this case was fought.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												By the paragraph 2 of the 
												accompanying statement of claim 
												the appellant averred:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;By reason of the nature of his 
												work, the plaintiff developed 
												some ailment which eventually 
												caused the defendant to retire 
												him on medical grounds &#8230;..&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The respondents countered these 
												facts by the paragraph 2 of 
												their statement of defence as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The defendant admit retiring 
												the plaintiff on medical grounds 
												but denies that the plaintiffs 
												ailment was occupational, that 
												is due to the nature of the work 
												assigned him by the defendant&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Thus, both at the trial and 
												understandably, appellate court 
												levels, the case was fought on 
												the fundamental issue of whether 
												or not there was a causal link 
												between his medical condition 
												and assigned work.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The introduction of the 
												contributory role of his 
												occupation in the development of 
												the disease is rather a 
												completely new point of fact and 
												offends the most basic and well 
												settled rule that an appellant 
												cannot be permitted to raise on 
												appeal a completely new issue of 
												fact which if it had been raised 
												at the trial, the parties would 
												have led the necessary evidence, 
												and would have being 
												investigated by the court. 
												Indeed the position been adopted 
												by the appellant could be 
												likened to that of a party who 
												raises for the first time on 
												appeal the issue, of 
												contributory negligence.&nbsp; </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												And so to the final question. 
												What was wrong with the 
												inference drawn by the appellant 
												court from the Exhibit C and E?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Both courts i.e. trial and 
												appellate, were of the opinion 
												that the inference to be drawn 
												as to whether or not the 
												ill-health was occupational, 
												depended on the meaning to be 
												attached to certain expressions 
												contained in the Exhibit E. The 
												salient portion of the Exhibit E 
												reads:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The above-named patient, a GAG 
												employee and an operator of one 
												of the mining heavy trucks, was 
												referred to us from your clinic, 
												with complaints of precordial 
												pains with dysponea occasional 
												spontaneous trenors of upper 
												limbs&nbsp; and presence of echopic 
												beats which were previously 
												absent but developed during the 
												course of work with GAG.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Based upon the fact that his 
												condition which developed during 
												his work with GAG has not 
												improved &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial judge reasoned that: 
												&#8220;Exhibit E says his condition 
												developed during the course of 
												work with GAG&#8221;, and further 
												concluded that.&nbsp; &#8220;This means the 
												illness is occupational, because 
												&#8220;work&#8221; is synonymous with 
												occupation.&nbsp; It developed during 
												the course of work with GAG and 
												that is what Exhibit &#8220;E&#8221; means 
												or Exhibit E makes this cause 
												more probable than not, for the 
												cause of the illness&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellate court, speaking 
												unanimously through Amoono 
												Monney J.A. rightly in my view, 
												rejected this narrow and 
												mechanical approach to the 
												interpretation of not even the 
												whole document, but selected 
												portions of it. The court first 
												demonstrated that it was 
												legitimate to interfere with the 
												finding, and then substitute its 
												own, given that it (the finding 
												or decision) depended &#8220;on the 
												interpretation of a document 
												without expert assistance&#8221; and 
												also that the disputed point has 
												to do with the proper inference 
												to be drawn from facts accepted 
												and acted upon by the trial 
												court. In this regard, the 
												conclusion properly reached, in 
												my view, by the appellate court 
												was that on the authority of
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) Attorney General v. Dadey 
												1971 1 GLR 228;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) Essandoh v. The Republic 
												1969 CC 63;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3) Nyame Tarian Transport &amp; 1 
												Or. 1973 1 GLR 8,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It had the competence to 
												substitute the correct 
												inference. The honourable court 
												thus concluded that the 
												expressions &#8220;which were 
												previously absent but developed 
												during the course of work with 
												GAG&#8221; are expressions of time in 
												which the event of the illness 
												occurred and have nothing to do 
												with the causation. They 
												contextualize in a time 
												dimension, time frame or time 
												perspective, the onset of the 
												illness without stating what 
												caused it. &#8220;Previously&#8221; surely, 
												refers time and &#8220;developed 
												during the course of work with 
												GAG surely means the symptoms 
												indicating the disease developed 
												while the respondent was in the 
												employment of GAG or during the 
												time that he was working with 
												GAG and not that his illness was 
												caused by the type or nature of 
												the work he did at GAG.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8230; His condition developed when 
												he was working with GAG and at 
												no other time&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The above construction does in 
												my view conform to the basic 
												rules of interpretation of 
												documents, namely that the 
												interpretation must be nearly as 
												close to the mind and intention 
												of the maker as is possible, and 
												the intention must be 
												ascertained from the document as 
												a whole, with the words used 
												being given their plain and 
												natural meaning and within the 
												context in which they are used.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Finally, the complaint that the 
												court wrongly interpreted the 
												Exhibit C is untenable Contrary 
												to counsel&#8217;s argument, there 
												were no inference to be drawn 
												from the Exhibit C which was on 
												its face, as plain as day light, 
												and indeed the court drew no 
												inferences from it. On the 
												contrary, as stated in the 
												Exhibit C, the plain finding of 
												the District medical Board, made 
												up of three doctors, makers of 
												Exhibit C is that it was unable 
												&#8220;to establish any causal 
												relationship between Nana&#8217;s 
												present condition and his 
												occupation as a Heavy machine 
												operator nor his involvement in 
												the work place accident in spite 
												of his employment medical 
												fitness&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As the court rightly found, the 
												burden of persuasion was on the 
												appellant, not the respondent. 
												It was for him to establish that 
												his illness was occupational, 
												and he did not succeed in doing 
												that. Much as I sympatise with 
												his misfortune, (ill health) he 
												cannot succeed in this appeal. 
												His Counsel&#8217;s passionate plea 
												that (1) we temper justice with 
												mercy in view of the 
												recommendation by the medical 
												review board that a generous 
												retirement package over and 
												above what he is legally 
												entitled to under the CBA, be 
												given him (2) further that there 
												has been a miscarriage of 
												justice and that we order a 
												retrial are all clearly 
												untenable. In such legal 
												matters, compassion has no role 
												to play. The appellate court was 
												right in its findings and 
												conclusions and we would not be 
												justified in law, in interfering 
												with them. I will dismiss this 
												appeal.</span></p>
