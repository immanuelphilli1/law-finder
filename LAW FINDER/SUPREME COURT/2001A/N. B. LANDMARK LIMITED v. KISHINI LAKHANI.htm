												This is an appeal against the 
												decision of the Court of Appeal 
												granting a stay of execution of 
												the ruling of the Circuit Court, 
												Accra dated 24th September, 
												1998. This ruling of the Circuit 
												Court refused an application to 
												set aside its decisions of 2nd 
												November 1998. The grounds of 
												appeal as set out in the Notice 
												of Appeal are:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a)&nbsp; The Court of Appeal erred 
												in law when stay of execution of 
												the Circuit Court judgment was 
												in effect granted when there was 
												an appeal against it.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b)&nbsp; The Court erred in law when 
												it refused to uphold that 
												service of hearing notices on 
												solicitors under the 
												circumstances of this case 
												amounted to service on the 
												respondent.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(c)&nbsp; The Court erred in law and 
												in contravention of the 
												constitution when it refused to 
												be bound by its previous 
												decision which distinguishes 
												between judgment that could be 
												set aside and judgment that 
												ought to be appealed against.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(d)&nbsp; The Court erred when it 
												sustained an application for 
												stay of execution based on 
												appeal against the refusal of 
												the Circuit Court to set aside 
												its judgment when the grounds to 
												set aside were based on 
												misapplication of law.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(e)&nbsp; The Court erred in ruling 
												on assessment of rent when the 
												issue was not before it.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(f)&nbsp; Further grounds of appeal 
												would be filed upon receipt of 
												the records of proceedings.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												No further grounds of appeal 
												were filed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The brief facts are that the 
												plaintiff issued a writ of 
												summons at the Circuit Court, 
												Accra against the defendant for</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) Recovery of Possession 
												and/or ejection order in respect 
												of shop No. 1 &amp; 2, Property No. 
												D684/4 Knutsford Avenue Accra.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b)&nbsp; Mesne profit from November 
												1997</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On 2nd November 1998, the 
												Circuit Court entered judgment 
												for the plaintiff against the 
												defendant, who though served, 
												did not attend the hearing. The 
												Court in its judgment ordered 
												the defendant to vacate and 
												yield up vacant possession of 
												the premises to the plaintiff, 
												and adjourned proceedings to the 
												24th November 1998 for the 
												assessment of economic rent to 
												be paid by the defendant from 
												November 1997 up to the date of 
												judgment.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The defendant moved the Circuit 
												Court to set aside this judgment 
												but the Court refused the 
												application. He therefore filed 
												an appeal on 30th November 1998 
												to the Court of Appeal against 
												the refusal, and followed this 
												up with an application for stay 
												of execution of the order 
												refusing to set aside the 
												judgment. The application for 
												stay was also dismissed. He 
												repeated the application at the 
												Court of Appeal which granted 
												same on 24th March, 1999 in the 
												following language:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;We think the appellant had 
												demonstrated she has very 
												serious legal question to raise 
												on appeal. We would thus allow 
												the application subject to the 
												applicant paying rent assessed 
												by the Land Valuation Board 
												effective from the date of 
												decision of the court below&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is this ruling which is the 
												subject of this appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In his statement of case the 
												appellant raises in his 
												paragraph 8 thereof, that the 
												discretion of stay of execution 
												has not been properly granted 
												and that the issue of rent was 
												not a subject matter of the 
												appeal before the Court. And 
												again in paragraph 11 that &quot;the 
												appeal before the Court of 
												Appeal for which the stay was 
												granted is in respect of the 
												trial Court's refusal to set 
												aside its judgment&quot; and not the 
												substantive judgment of 2nd 
												November 1999.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In my view, by the above two 
												submissions, the appellant 
												challenges the propriety of the 
												Court of Appeal's grant of stay 
												of execution vis-à-vis the 
												judgment in respect of which the 
												appeal was lodged and on which 
												the application for stay of 
												execution was dependent.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the respondent's statement of 
												case, he contends that the Court 
												of Appeal had power under Rule 
												31 of CI. 19 to make the interim 
												order it did.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Now it is trite learning that an 
												application for stay of 
												execution, presupposes that the 
												order or decision in respect of 
												which the stay is sought is 
												capable of being executed by any 
												of the known processes of 
												execution. If the order or 
												decision is incapable of being 
												executed, an application for 
												stay of execution cannot be 
												applied in respect of it. Thus 
												in Eboe vrs Eboe (1961) GLR 432 
												Ollenu J, as he then was held 
												that declaration that the 
												defendant was a trustee did not 
												require any person to do 
												anything or abstain from doing 
												anything and there was no method 
												of executing it. Consequently 
												there could be no application to 
												stay the said order. Citing with 
												approval this decision in Eboe 
												vrs. Eboe (supra). Taylor JSC in 
												his dissenting opinion in Mensah 
												v. Ghana Football Association 
												(1988-1989) 1 GLR 1 at 12 said:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The concept of stay of 
												execution in our law... is found 
												on the idea that where the 
												person against whom the order is 
												directed is in no position to 
												execute the judgment by the 
												various execution processes, 
												then a stay of execution is 
												meaningless and logically 
												pointless&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the instant case the judgment 
												in respect of which the 
												application for stay was sought, 
												was one refusing to set aside a 
												default judgment. How does one 
												go into execution in respect of 
												such refusal order? The appeal 
												was not in respect of the main 
												judgment of 2nd November 1998 
												which ordered the defendant to 
												give up vacant possession of the 
												premises. A stay of execution 
												can of course be applied to stay 
												the substantive judgment if an 
												appeal had been filed against it 
												and the relevant application for 
												stay is filed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is quite clear that the Court 
												of Appeal appeared to be misled 
												by the attractive legal 
												submissions made against the 
												substantive judgment of 2nd 
												November 1998, into granting the 
												application for stay.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Obviously, if the courts 
												attention had been drawn to the 
												fact that notwithstanding the 
												attractiveness of legal 
												submissions, the 2nd November 
												1998 judgment was neither the 
												decision on appeal nor the one 
												in respect of which the 
												application for stay was 
												directed, it would have 
												considered whether the decision 
												of 28th November 1998 refusing 
												to set aside the judgment was 
												capable of being stayed to 
												warrant an application for stay 
												of execution.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I have no doubt in my mind that 
												the decision refusing to set 
												aside a default judgment is 
												incapable of being executed by 
												any of the known processes of 
												execution. And consequently, an 
												application for stay of 
												execution of such a decision 
												cannot arise.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On this ground alone, we allow 
												the appeal, and set aside the 
												ruling of the Court of Appeal 
												dated 24th March, 1999.</span></p>
