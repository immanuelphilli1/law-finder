												JUDGMENT</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												AKUFFO, J.S.C:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I have been privileged to see 
												beforehand the erudite opinion 
												of my brother Mr. Justice Adzoe, 
												J.S.C. and, for the reasons 
												stated therein, I am in full 
												agreement with him that the 
												appeal must succeed and the 
												decision of the Court of Appeal 
												be set aside.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I will therefore limit this 
												opinion to the issue, raised in 
												paragraph (c) of the additional 
												grounds of appeal, regarding the 
												proper period over which the 
												interest awarded should remain 
												exigible. In its amended 
												counterclaim, filed on May 04, 
												1988, the appellant claimed an 
												amount of ¢58,213.04 as the sum 
												due for maintenance services 
												previously rendered to the 
												respondent, together with 
												interest thereon at the Bank 
												rate prevailing at the date of 
												judgment, from 20th December 
												1984 up to the date of final 
												payment. The trial court, after 
												finding the said amount as being 
												justly due and payable by the 
												respondent, however, awarded 
												interest thereon up to the date 
												of the judgment, i.e., 16th May 
												1990. According to the 
												appellant, taking into account 
												the time lapse between the 
												judgement of the trial court and 
												that of the Court of Appeal, the 
												latter, in upholding the 
												counterclaim ought to have 
												varied the trial court's order 
												and awarded the interest to be&nbsp; 
												calculated from 20th December 
												1984 to the date of final 
												payment at the prevailing bank 
												rate.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Since there was no contract 
												between the parties stipulating 
												the payment of interest on any 
												amount arising from the services 
												of the appellant, the trial 
												judge, correctly, based his 
												order on the provisions of the 
												Courts (Award of Interest) 
												Instrument,, 1984 (LI 1295), 
												which reads as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Where in any civil case or 
												matter the Court makes an order 
												for the payment of interest on 
												any sum due to the plaintiff 
												other than any sum claimed by 
												the Plaintiff under Order 13 
												rule 3 of the High Court (Civil 
												Procedure) Rules, 1954 (LN 140A) 
												the rate at which such interest 
												shall be payable shall be the 
												Bank rate prevailing at the time 
												the order was made by the Court, 
												but no compound interest shall 
												be awarded.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												However, it is clear that the 
												only factor governed by this 
												statue is the rate of interest 
												to be applied to the sum due. 
												Thus, the time span over which 
												the interest should be 
												calculated is left to the 
												discretion of the Court and 
												should, therefore, be determined 
												by the dictates of the 
												circumstances of the matter. As 
												was stressed by Brobbey, J.A., 
												in his dissenting opinion in the 
												Court of Appeal, discretion must 
												be exercised judicially and 
												whether or not discretion has 
												been properly exercised must be 
												ascertainable from the reasons 
												given for the exercise or the 
												basis for the discretion. In 
												deciding to order the interest 
												to be payable up to the date of 
												the judgement, the trial judge 
												appears to have relied upon the 
												decision of the High Court in 
												Holland West Africa et al V. Pan 
												African Trading Company et al. 
												[1976] 2 GLR 179, wherein 
												Edusei, J, awarded interest with 
												effect from the date the cause 
												of action arose up to the date 
												of the judgement of the trial 
												court. That case, however, had 
												nothing to do with ascertainment 
												of the date on which the 
												calculation of interest ceases 
												and the learned Edusei, J., like 
												the trial judge in the matter 
												herein, did not give any 
												particular reason for deciding 
												that the interest cease on the 
												date of his judgement.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The underlying principle for the 
												award of interest is now well 
												settled and was spelt out by 
												Lord Denning MR, in the 
												celebrated case of Harbutt's 
												Plasticine Ltd V. Wayne Tank and 
												Pump Co. Ltd. [1970] 1 All ER 
												225 at page 236, as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;... the basis of an award of 
												interest is that the defendant 
												has kept the plaintiff out of 
												his money; and the defendant has 
												had the use of it himself. So he 
												ought to compensate the 
												plaintiff accordingly.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(See also Jefford V Gee [1970] 1 
												All ER 1202, wherein the English 
												Court of Appeal was guided by 
												this principle.) In the earlier 
												case of London, Chatham and 
												Dover Railway Co. V. South 
												Eastern Railway Co [1893] AC 
												429, Lord Herschell LC had put 
												the matter even more graphically 
												as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;... when money is owing from 
												one party to another and that 
												other is driven to have recourse 
												to legal proceedings in order to 
												recover the amount due to him, 
												the party who is wrongfully 
												withholding the money from the 
												other ought not in justice to 
												benefit by having that money in 
												his possession and enjoying the 
												use of it, when the money ought 
												to be in the possession of the 
												other party who is entitled to 
												its use. Therefore, if I could 
												see my way to do so, I should 
												certainly be disposed to give 
												the appellants, or anybody in a 
												similar position, interest upon 
												the amount withheld from the 
												time of action brought at all 
												events.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Clearly this is the same 
												principle guiding LI 1295. That 
												being the case, since the 
												appellant's claim for interest 
												related to a commercial debt 
												owed by the respondent, which 
												debt, as far as the record 
												shows, remains unpaid up to now, 
												it stands to reason that such 
												interest continue at least until 
												the date of final judgement, if 
												not the date of final payment. 
												Otherwise, if the respondent 
												does not settle the amount due 
												immediately after the entry of 
												judgement, what justice will the 
												appellant have received from the 
												courts for the respondent's 
												unjustifiable withholding and 
												use of the money all these 
												years?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Moreover, in May 1990 when the 
												trial judge made his order, the 
												prevailing Bank rate of interest 
												applied by the court was 30% per 
												annum and the average rate of 
												exchange between the Cedi and 
												the US Dollar was ¢275.00 to 
												US$1.00 Eleven years down the 
												line, the applicable rate of 
												interest may be put at 45%, per 
												annum and the average rate of 
												exchange is ¢7,200.00 to 
												US$1.00. These factors clearly 
												demonstrate the extent to which 
												the value of the appellant's 
												money has eroded over the period 
												that it had not only been 
												deprived of the ownership of the 
												money but also the use of it. In 
												his dissenting opinion in the 
												Court of Appeal, Brobbey, J.A., 
												who was of the view that the 
												interest be exigible until the 
												date of final judgement, 
												expressed himself on this issue 
												as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Another policy reason why 
												interest should be ordered 
												exigible to the date of final 
												judgement is this:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In a country like ours with 
												rapid rate of inflation, if a 
												person is ordered to pay money 
												and payment is not made 
												immediately, or within a 
												reasonable time, the value of 
												the amount ordered to be paid 
												will trifle into insignificance 
												with the effluxion of time, for 
												instance a debt of five million 
												Cedis in 1988 which was not paid 
												till 1995 will be worth about 
												half that amount in 1995. A 
												ruling that interest should be 
												paid only up to the date of 
												judgement of the trial Court 
												will amount to this: If the 
												debtor can avoid the creditor 
												for some time after that 
												judgement has been delivered, he 
												will be better off. A ruling to 
												that effect will therefore 
												encourage debtors not only to be 
												evasive and therefore bad 
												debtors, but will do injustice 
												to the creditor who will not 
												only continue to be deprived of 
												his money and the use of it, but 
												also cause that creditor to 
												suffer unduly from the effects 
												of inflation resulting in 
												reduction of the value of the 
												money, for as long as the debtor 
												can put off payment of the trial 
												court's judgement. An effective 
												means of putting off payment of 
												the amount ordered is to pursue 
												litigation in our courts. 
												However seemingly hopeless the 
												appeal may be, the debtor will 
												be encouraged to pursue it 
												because knowing how lengthy 
												appeals in this country take to 
												be concluded, by the time the 
												case reaches the Supreme Court, 
												the debt would have been 
												swallowed by inflation....... It 
												is my view that the courts owe 
												it as a duty to discourage 
												litigation and encourage the 
												debtors to honour their 
												obligations or pay their debts 
												but not to encourage them to be 
												evasive and litigious.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I wholeheartedly endorse this 
												view. However, it is my humble 
												opinion that we must go even 
												farther, in order to give full 
												effect to the aforesaid 
												underlying principle. 
												Consequently, since the trial 
												judge gave no specific reasons 
												for his order, the same may be 
												varied and I believe this court 
												owes it as a duty to the 
												appellant, and to creditors in a 
												similar position, to order, 
												firstly, that the interest on 
												the amount owed must run on the 
												amount due, or the reducing 
												balance thereof, up to and 
												inclusive of the date of final 
												payment. Secondly, by virtue of 
												Section 2(4) of the Courts Act, 
												1993 (Act 459) this court has 
												all the powers vested in the 
												High Court by the Constitution 
												and any other law, which 
												includes LI 1295. In the 
												circumstances therefore, it 
												stands to reason that, in order 
												to give the appellant a just and 
												equitable recompense for the 
												respondent's unlawful 
												withholding and use of its 
												money, the rate of interest 
												applicable to the amount due 
												must be that currently 
												prevailing. I am fortified in 
												this view by the recent decision 
												delivered by this court in the 
												case of Waseem Attieh V Koglex 
												Ltd. et als, unreported S.C. 
												judgement in suit no. C.A. 
												3/2000, dated May 09, 2001, 
												wherein interest was awarded &quot;at 
												the current bank rate&quot; from 1st 
												may 1990 up to the date of final 
												payment.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It needs to be noted, however, 
												that the Bank of Ghana no longer 
												fixes a specific bank rate of 
												interest. As such therefore, 
												these days, the prevailing rate 
												of interest differs from bank to 
												bank. The only bench mark that 
												influences interest charged by 
												individual banks, is the rate of 
												interest payable by the Bank of 
												Ghana on its 90-day Treasury 
												Bills; presently, this is 45%. 
												Clearly, therefore, this is the 
												rate of interest that must be 
												applied in this case. At the end 
												of the day, the appellant, as 
												creditor, must be seen to have 
												been placed in the same position 
												it would have been in had the 
												respondent, as debtor, settled 
												its debts in due time.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Finally, I wish to add that, 
												given the fiscal realities that 
												have prevailed in this country 
												over the past two decades and 
												the recalcitrance of too many 
												debtors in the fulfilment of 
												their obligations, it would 
												augur well for the country if LI 
												1295 were amended to give the 
												Court the power to award 
												compound interest. Compounding 
												interest on debts is, perhaps, 
												the only effective mechanism, 
												which will allow the amount due 
												to grow in line with inflation, 
												provided the correct rate of 
												interest is also employed. 
												Economic development depends, to 
												a large extent, on healthy 
												financial interaction and 
												transaction; these, in turn, 
												cannot exist without 
												credibility. It is only when 
												participants in business live up 
												to their legal obligations, and 
												cease using the processes of the 
												courts to evade financial 
												responsibilities that this 
												country can finally launch 
												itself firmly on the road to 
												economic success. Where money is 
												unjustly withheld, then the 
												creditor must be seen to have 
												been justly recompensed by the 
												debtor for the unjust use of 
												other people's money. Any system 
												that tends to encourage, debtors 
												to shirk their responsibilities 
												benefits no one but such 
												delinquent debtors, and poor 
												debt servicing in the business 
												sector only fans, further, the 
												flames of inflation. It seems to 
												me that if the consequences of 
												delinquency were made less 
												appealing than they are now, 
												then the attraction of needless 
												protracted litigation would be 
												significantly reduced.</span></p>

												ADZOE, J.S.C.:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In July, 1977 the Respondent 
												company purchased from the 
												Appellant company an IBM Copier 
												II Machine for an amount of 
												¢33,000.00. That same month the 
												Appellant company installed the 
												machine for the Respondents in 
												Cape Coast. It is quite clear 
												that up to about 1984 the 
												engineers of the Appellant 
												company serviced the said 
												machine for the Respondents, but 
												thereafter the Appellants 
												declined to do any further 
												servicing. The Respondents claim 
												that when the machine broke down 
												again in February, 1986 they 
												made several demands on the 
												Appellants to effect the 
												necessary repairs but the 
												Appellants wrongfully refused to 
												do the repairs which resulted in 
												the Respondents' inability to 
												function in their business. They 
												claimed they suffered loss. 
												Accordingly, on 17th March, 1987 
												the Respondents sued the 
												Appellants at the High Court 
												claiming as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(i) Specific Performance of an 
												(oral) agreement between the 
												Plaintiff Company and the 
												Defendant Company made in 1977 
												for an After Sale Service of the 
												Plaintiff company's IBM Copier 
												II Machine &quot;on call basis&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												They also claimed ¢1,205,000.00 
												special damages representing 
												loss of income, interest on the 
												said amount at the rate of 25% 
												from 1st April, 1986 to the date 
												of final judgment, and also 
												mesne profits, plus interest 
												thereon.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Respondent took pains to set 
												out in their statement of claim 
												various particulars of the 
												alleged oral agreement. I need 
												to set out two paragraphs of the 
												statement of claim in order to 
												make for a clear appreciation of 
												the basis of the Respondents' 
												claims.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Paragraph 4 of the statement of 
												claim reads:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Previously to the supply of the 
												said IBM copier Machine by the 
												Defendant company to the 
												Plaintiff company, it was agreed 
												that the Defendant company would 
												provide an exclusive maintenance 
												service, designated as After 
												Sale Service and for a fee 
												and/or &quot;On Call Basis&quot; and also 
												for a fee.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In paragraph 7 of the statement 
												of claim the Respondents alleged 
												as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;7. The Plaintiff company avers 
												that it accepted the offer to 
												buy the said IBM Copier II 
												machine upon the clear 
												undertaking that it is trade 
												policy of the defendant company 
												that its products are serviced 
												and maintained exclusively by 
												the defendant company or its 
												appointed agents for whom the 
												defendant company on various 
												occasions as shall be noted in 
												paragraph 11, 12 and 13 of the 
												Plaintiff company's letter dated 
												28/11/1985 ... and letter dated 
												30/6/86.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Appellants denied having 
												made any oral agreement with the 
												Respondents; they claimed that 
												the Respondents declined to 
												enter into a maintenance service 
												agreement with the Appellants 
												and insisted that whatever 
												maintenance service they 
												rendered to the Respondents was 
												on a case by case basis under a 
												scheme described as &quot;On Call 
												Basis&quot; which did not create any 
												standing contract binding the 
												Appellants. In effect the 
												Appellants claimed that they 
												were not bound by any contract 
												which the Respondents could call 
												upon them to specifically 
												perform.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial High Court found that 
												there was no enforceable 
												contract between the parties and 
												dismissed the Appellants' claim. 
												But the Court of Appeal reversed 
												that judgment by a majority 
												decision of 2-1 and held the 
												Appellants liable to the 
												Respondents' claims, and the 
												Appellants have therefore come 
												before this court for a final 
												determination.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The original grounds of appeal 
												before us are:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												1. The judgment is against the 
												weight of evidence on record.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2. The Court of Appeal erred in 
												rejecting findings of fact made 
												by the trial High Court which 
												had had the benefit of observing 
												the demeanour of witnesses, and 
												substituting its own findings of 
												fact and thereby occasioning 
												substantial miscarriage of 
												justice to the 
												Defendant/Respondents/Appellants.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3. Further grounds of appeal 
												have been filed, but in my 
												opinion the original ground one 
												is enough to decide the matter.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												They plead in relief that we set 
												aside the judgment of the Court 
												of Appeal and restore the 
												judgment of the trial High 
												Court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is clear that the Respondents 
												based their claim on what is 
												known as the principle of 
												promissory estoppel. Some call 
												it equitable estoppel. Denning, 
												J. (as he then was) expressed it 
												in the case of Central London 
												Property Trust Ltd. vrs. High 
												Trees House Ltd. (1947) KB. 130 
												where it was held that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Where parties enter into an 
												arrangement which is intended to 
												create legal relations between 
												them and in pursuance of such 
												arrangement one party makes a 
												promise to the other which he 
												knows will be acted on and which 
												is in fact acted on by the 
												promisee, the court will take 
												the promise as binding on the 
												promisor to the extent that it 
												will not allow him to act 
												inconsistently with it even 
												although the promise may not be 
												supported by considerations in 
												the strict sense...&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the several decisions which 
												followed the High Trees Case, 
												the principle saw significant 
												amplification's on its terms of 
												application. And in the case of 
												Evenden vrs. Guildford City 
												Football Club (1957) 3 All E.R. 
												269, Lord Denning, now as Master 
												of the Rolls, at page 273 of the 
												Report said that the principle 
												applies whenever the 
												representation is made &quot;whether 
												of fact or law, present or 
												future which is intended to be 
												binding, intended to induce a 
												person to act on it and he does 
												act on it&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the case of Combe vrs. Combe 
												(1951) 1 All E.R. 767 the same 
												Lord Denning reviewed the cases 
												and observed:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;In none of these cases was the 
												defendant sued on the promise, 
												assurance or assertion as a 
												cause of action in itself: he 
												was sued for some other cause, 
												for example, a pension or a 
												breach of contract, and the 
												Promise, assurance or assertion 
												only played a supplementary 
												role, an important role, no 
												doubt, but still a supplementary 
												role. That is, I think, its true 
												function. It may be part of a 
												cause of action, but not a cause 
												of action in itself&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is thus clear from the 
												authorities that a party who is 
												relying on the principle of 
												promissory estoppel must make 
												out a clear case that such a 
												promise was made intended to be 
												binding, intended to induce him 
												to act on it and that he in fact 
												acted on it. I think that such 
												alleged promise or 
												representation forms a vital 
												part of the cause of action and 
												must be proved. In all the 
												decided cases in which the 
												principle was applied the 
												promise or representation is 
												established as having been made. 
												it is not a matter of conjecture 
												and speculation. Where it is to 
												be inferred, the facts must 
												exist which justify the 
												inference. Chitty on Contracts 
												is emphatic that to bring the 
												principle into operation &quot;the 
												promise or representation must 
												be clear, or unequivocal, or 
												precise and unambiguous&quot;. See 
												25th Edition: Vol. 1 pp. 
												119-200. I am not be understood 
												as saying that the promise or 
												representation must be express; 
												it may be implied where the 
												course of the negotiations 
												between the parties justify it. 
												But the promise or 
												representation cannot be a 
												matter of mere speculation.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is also clear from the 
												authorities that if the promise 
												or representation was indeed, 
												made, the promisee must show 
												that the promise or 
												representation influenced his 
												conduct. To my mind, it seems 
												therefore that the principle 
												will not apply if it is shown 
												that a party's conduct was not 
												influenced by the promise. As 
												stated in the case Societe 
												Italo-Belge (1981) 2 Lloyd's 
												Rep. 695, 701, for the principle 
												to apply the promisee must be 
												shown to have altered his 
												position in reliance on the 
												promise so that it will be 
												inequitable to allow the 
												promisor to act inconsistently 
												with it.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The case of Evenden vrs. 
												Guilford City Association 
												Football Club Ltd (1957) 2 All 
												E.R. 269 which I have already 
												referred to and to which the 
												majority judgment in the Court 
												of Appeal also referred may give 
												us a clear illustration of the 
												points I have tried to 
												highlight. The facts of the case 
												can be stated briefly:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Mr. Evenden was employed as a 
												groundsman at the football 
												ground at Guilford. He was 
												employed by the Guilford 
												supporters Club and worked with 
												them from August, 1955 up to 
												October, 1968. The supporters 
												club paid him. In 1968 there was 
												a re-arrangement whereby he 
												ceased to be employed by the 
												supporters club; instead of the 
												supporters club, the football 
												club itself employed him to do 
												the same job that he did for the 
												supporters club. During the 
												changeover from the supporters 
												club to the football club a 
												definite agreement was made to 
												the effect that Mr. Evenden's 
												service should be regarded as 
												unbroken. In 1974 he was 
												dismissed by reason of 
												redundancy and the question was 
												whether he was entitled to 
												redundancy payment from 1955 or 
												from 1968 when the football club 
												took him on. Lord Denning 
												applied the doctrine of 
												Promissory estoppel and held 
												that the football club was bound 
												to pay the benefits from 1955. 
												The case, he said:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;... falls within the principle 
												of Central London property vrs. 
												High Trees House Ltd. At the 
												meeting of October, 1968 there 
												was a clear representation by 
												the football club that Mr. 
												Evenden's employment would be 
												treated as continuous. That 
												representation was intended to 
												be binding and intended to be 
												acted upon. He did act on it. He 
												did not claim from the 
												supporters' club the redundancy 
												payment to which he would 
												otherwise have been entitled 
												from the club. Six months later 
												his claim against the 
												supporters' club was barred by 
												lapse of time. It would be most 
												unfair for the football club to 
												go back now on that 
												representation. They must be 
												bound by it in the Industrial 
												Court and elsewhere.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Now, the question raised by 
												ground I of the appellants' 
												appeal could be put this way: 
												Did the evidence before the 
												trial court support the finding 
												made by the Court of Appeal that 
												the Appellants were bound in law 
												to repair the machine sold to 
												the Respondents within the 
												framework of the doctrine of 
												promissory estoppel? The 
												appellants say that the finding 
												made by the Court of Appeal is 
												against the weight of evidence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The crux of the Respondents' 
												case as pleaded in the Statement 
												of Claim is that before they 
												purchased the machine &quot;it was 
												agreed that defendant company 
												would provide an exclusive 
												maintenance service, designated 
												as 'After Sale Service' for a 
												fee and/or 'On Call Basis' and 
												also for a fee&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellants denied this 
												averment and contended in 
												paragraph 16 of the Statement of 
												Defence that it was &quot;12 months 
												after the sale when the warrant 
												period had expired&quot; that they 
												asked the Respondents to enter 
												into a maintenance service 
												agreement with them but the 
												Respondents declined to enter 
												into any such agreement. I 
												understand the &quot;warrant period&quot; 
												to mean that the Appellants had 
												undertaken or guaranteed that 
												for a period of 12 months after 
												the delivery of the machine they 
												would repair or replace it, if 
												necessary. Certainly it does not 
												appear that it is any such 
												warranty which the Respondents 
												rely on because their case is 
												that the agreement to repair the 
												machine was for &quot;life services&quot; 
												promised by the appellants. 
												Their representative who 
												testified before the High Court 
												said in his evidence that he 
												bought the machine from the 
												company &quot;because of the 'life 
												services' it was to give to me 
												and because of after sales 
												services promised me by their 
												Sales Manager with whom I had 
												discussions prior to the 
												purchase&quot;. On the other hand he 
												also told the Court that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Before the machine was 
												installed the defendants gave me 
												two specific instructions with 
												regard to its maintenance, 
												namely maintenance agreement or 
												after call service&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Thus apart from the promise 
												before the sale and the supply, 
												there was also an agreement 
												after the supply but before the 
												installation. According to the 
												evidence, therefore, the 
												respondents purchased the 
												machine because they relied on 
												the pre-sale promise by the 
												appellants that they would 
												service the machine throughout 
												its full life span of operation, 
												and when the machine arrived 
												they were asked to choose 
												between two options of 
												agreement. On that evidence the 
												Court of Appeal rightly, in my 
												view, came to the conclusion 
												that</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;the plaintiff's case is not 
												dependent solely on the per call 
												service per se, but more 
												importantly the pre-sale 
												agreement or promise by the 
												defendants' Sales Manager to the 
												effect that the company would 
												provide exclusive after-sale 
												maintenance.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Let me deal first with the 
												alleged pre-sale promise or 
												agreement because it is the main 
												issue which involves the 
												doctrine of promissory estoppel 
												which the respondents rely on. 
												They say it is the pre-sale 
												agreement or promise which 
												induced them to buy the machine. 
												Without that promise they would 
												not have bought it.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I am unable to find any evidence 
												in support of respondents' 
												contention. It is one thing 
												pleading a cause and repeating 
												it in Court, and another thing 
												providing evidence in support of 
												the causes so pleaded. It is a 
												common rule of evidence that 
												except in certain special 
												circumstances, a party who 
												relies on a fact must prove it. 
												Section 14 of the Evidence 
												Decree, 1975, (NRCD 323) 
												provides that the burden of 
												persuasion as to the existence 
												of a fact lies on the party to 
												whose case the fact is 
												essential. In their effort to 
												establish the pre-sale agreement 
												or promise the respondents 
												sought to rely on certain 
												letters, particularly Exhibit I 
												and Exhibit B. Exhibit I was a 
												letter dated 16/4/86 and written 
												by the appellants to the 
												respondents. It was a reply to 
												some letters from the 
												respondents in which they 
												(respondents) had complained 
												that the appellants did not 
												serve them with a certain 
												notice. The appellants in 
												Exhibit I simply sought to tell 
												the respondents that they 
												(respondents) were not entitled 
												to that notice. The relevant 
												portion of that letter, Exhibit 
												I stated:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;You complained you were not 
												notified. I informed you the 
												letters were targetted to 
												customers we had contracts with 
												us for maintenance. You did not 
												have maintenance agreement hence 
												we did not have any agreement to 
												cancel.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Exhibit B from the respondents 
												also merely complained about the 
												appellants' refusal to go to 
												Cape Coast to inspect the 
												machine. Its contents were to 
												the effect that the machine had 
												broken down and some 
												instructions appeared on the key 
												board which read:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;If the light does not go out 
												call IBM services.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												According to the letter the 
												respondents had telephoned the 
												appellants on 30/7/82, and 
												expected appellants to send an 
												engineer; it was because the 
												engineer did not go to the 
												respondents that they were 
												writing Exhibit B to the 
												appellants. Referring to the 
												directive which appeared on the 
												machine, Exhibit B continued as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;This directive was the reason 
												for our telephone call to your 
												engineering department on Friday 
												July 30, 1982.... The purpose of 
												writing this letter is to 
												inquire from you why we have to 
												wait for your engineer to have 
												another job in Cape Coast before 
												our request is attended to. You 
												will agree with us that we have 
												promptly honoured all bills sent 
												to us to enable us have your 
												confidence in our 'call service' 
												with you.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Quite clearly these letters do 
												not make out any agreement or 
												promise or representation which 
												can form the basis for the 
												operation of the doctrine of 
												promissory estoppel as decided 
												by the authorities or as 
												provided for in Section 26 of 
												the Evidence Decree (NRCD 323).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Court of Appeal heavily 
												relied on the fact that the 
												appellants were &quot;the 
												manufacturers of the machine&quot;, 
												the fact that &quot;it was new on the 
												Ghanaian market&quot;, the fact that 
												&quot;it was rare and expensive&quot; and 
												the direction &quot;call IBM Service&quot; 
												as sufficient grounds for the 
												conclusion that the Sales 
												Manager of the appellants was 
												likely to assure a prospective 
												purchaser of exclusive 
												after-sale services, and 
												observed that &quot;the defendants 
												could not have certainly enticed 
												their customers without such 
												exclusive after-sale service 
												assurance&quot;. That is stretching 
												the law to a point of absurdity. 
												What the law looks for is the 
												outward manifestations of an 
												agreement, not speculation. As 
												is stated by Anson in his book 
												&quot;The Law of Contract&quot; (25th 
												Edition at p. 12):</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Agreement is not a mental state 
												but an act, and as an act, it is 
												a matter of inference from 
												conduct. The parties are to be 
												judged, not by what is in their 
												minds, but by what they have 
												said or written or done.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I hold that the respondents did 
												not establish the pre-sale 
												agreement or promise and that 
												the conclusion reached by the 
												Court of Appeal is not clearly 
												supported by the evidence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The matter does not end there, 
												however. The respondents also 
												relied on what the parties call 
												&quot;per call&quot; service agreement and 
												in my judgment we must examine 
												the scope and legal effect of 
												that agreement. This is how the 
												respondents put it.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The explained maintenance 
												agreement to mean entering into 
												an agreement whereby I pay a 
												specific sum of money so that 
												whenever the machine was faulty 
												they would come down and service 
												it. The after-call service meant 
												whenever the machine was faulty 
												I would call upon them to come 
												and service it and after the 
												service I would pay them upon 
												presentation of their bill.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The evidence indicates that the 
												respondents did not enter into 
												the maintenance agreement. They 
												opted for the per call service 
												agreement. The appellants also 
												admit that they serviced the 
												machine on per call basis. The 
												trial judge held that the per 
												call agreement did not 
												constitute a standing or 
												permanent contract binding on 
												the appellants to attend to 
												every call made by the 
												respondents. I agree with the 
												learned trial judge. As Lord 
												Buckmaster observed in the House 
												of Lords in the case of May and 
												Butcher vrs. R (1934) 2 K.B. 17
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;It has long been a 
												well-recognized principle of 
												contract law that an agreement 
												between two parties to enter 
												into an agreement in which some 
												critical part of the matter is 
												left undetermined is no contract 
												at all.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is unfortunate that the Court 
												of Appeal ignored this aspect of 
												the respondents' claim. My 
												understanding of the per call 
												arrangement, is that the 
												contract negotiations under it 
												will start when the respondents 
												call on the appellants to come 
												and repair the machine. In 
												contract law that will be an 
												offer. The appellants might or 
												might not agree to do the job 
												depending on such negotiations 
												as they might have with the 
												respondents with regard to such 
												matters as the cost involved, 
												availability of materials and 
												other charges. If the two 
												parties come to an agreement on 
												all essential issues and the 
												appellants agree to do the work, 
												there is then in law an 
												acceptance which will constitute 
												the negotiations into a 
												concluded bargain called a 
												contract. Each offer and 
												acceptance will be a separate 
												contract and no one of such 
												contracts will bind the 
												appellants to continue servicing 
												the machine until doomsday. If 
												it is so, then the appellants 
												have not been shown to be in 
												breach of any contract and the 
												respondents' claim must be 
												dismissed. That is the 
												inevitable conclusion on the 
												facts and I do not see any 
												justification for the 
												conclusions reached by the Court 
												of Appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It may be observed that the 
												respondents believed that the 
												contract or promise they claimed 
												to have been made by the 
												appellants could be found in the 
												letters exchanged between them 
												and the appellants. It was not 
												easy to find it. Most of those 
												letters said very little in 
												favour of the respondents' case, 
												and rather cumulatively 
												emphasised the appellants' 
												denial of a contract. The rule 
												is that where a court has to 
												find a contract in 
												correspondence, and not in any 
												one particular document, the 
												entire set of correspondence 
												which passed between the parties 
												must be taken into 
												consideration. In Thomas Hussey 
												vrs. John-Payne &amp; Anor. (1879) 4 
												App. Case 311, Earl Cairns, the 
												Lord Chancellor said at p. 316:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The second requisite in this 
												case he proposes to supply 
												through the medium of letters 
												which passed between the 
												parties, and it is one of the 
												first principles applicable to a 
												case of the kind that where you 
												have to find your contract, or 
												your note or your memorandum of 
												the terms of the contract in 
												letter, you must take into 
												consideration the whole of the 
												correspondence which has passed. 
												You must not at one particular 
												time draw a line and say 'we 
												will look at the letters up to 
												this point and find in them a 
												contract or not, but we will 
												look at nothing beyond'. In 
												order to fairly estimate what 
												was arranged, if anything was 
												agreed between the parties, you 
												must look at the whole of that 
												which took place and passed 
												between them.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I would uphold the appellants' 
												contention that the conclusion 
												reached by the Court of Appeal 
												is not supported by the evidence 
												and allow the appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I find it necessary to make a 
												brief observation about the 
												additional ground (b) filed by 
												the Appellants. The argument 
												urged on this ground is that 
												even if there was an enforceable 
												agreement in existence binding 
												on the Appellants to service the 
												machine, it was wrong for the 
												Court of Appeal to have granted 
												an order of specific performance 
												to the Respondents who had 
												failed to pay for services 
												rendered to them by the 
												Appellants in fulfilment of that 
												contract. The answer provided by 
												the Court of Appeal to the 
												Appellants' contention is this:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Now the defendants further 
												contend that assuming the 'Per 
												Call' service was binding on 
												them, the plaintiff breached, or 
												released them of their 
												obligation by first, their 
												failure to settle the 
												outstanding bill of 
												¢58,213.04... The trial judge 
												held that ..(this) released the 
												defendants of their obligations 
												if even the per call service is 
												accepted to be binding on the 
												defendants. Now the law is that 
												a contract is not discharged 
												automatically by breach unless 
												the party not in breach elects 
												to treat the breach as a 
												repudiation of the contract.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The learned judges therefore 
												held that the nonpayment of the 
												bill could not release the 
												appellants from their obligation 
												under the per call agreement.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												With due deference to their 
												Lordships, I think their 
												conclusion was in error. It must 
												be borne in mind that specific 
												performance is an equitable 
												relief. It is exceptional in its 
												character, and a Court has the 
												discretion either to grant it or 
												to refuse it. That discretion is 
												exercised on fixed principles. 
												One such principle is that a 
												plaintiff who seeks specific 
												performance of a contract must 
												show that he is ready and 
												willing to perform his own 
												obligation under the contract, 
												and any&nbsp; failure on his part, or 
												breach of his own obligation is 
												a bar to his claim for specific 
												performance. (Vide Halsbury's 
												Laws of England 3rd Edition, 
												Volume 36, paragraph 391).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This principle of contract law 
												is quite different from the 
												principle of repudiation which 
												the Court of Appeal relied on.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Finally, I would touch briefly 
												on the issue of the interest 
												exigible on the debt of 
												¢58,213.04 due from the 
												Respondents to the Appellants. 
												The Appellants contend that the 
												order to pay interest should 
												have been varied by the Court of 
												Appeal to run up to the date of 
												payment of the debt. In their 
												counterclaim what the Appellants 
												asked for was interest until the 
												date of final judgment. The 
												trial judge assessed it at 
												¢95.595.75 as at the date of the 
												High Court judgment on 16/5/90. 
												The majority opinion of the 
												Court of Appeal accepted that 
												the High Court was right in 
												awarding interest but did not 
												consider varying it. They did 
												not consider raising it because 
												the point was not taken before 
												them. The Appellants now seek a 
												variation for an order that the 
												interest be made to run up to 
												the date of payment. It is 
												strange that the Appellants have 
												not seen it fit to settle this 
												indebtedness even after the 
												Court of Appeal judgment. The 
												debt is certainly of very little 
												value to the Appellants on 
												today's financial market and it 
												is may opinion that in order to 
												do justice to the Appellants, 
												the variation sought by the 
												Appellants must be granted. I 
												order that the interest be paid 
												at the prevailing bank rate from 
												20/12/84 up to the date of final 
												payment.</span></p>

												decided by this Court on 
												9/5/2001.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the result, the appeal 
												succeeds. The judgment of the 
												Court of Appeal is set aside.

												restored subject to the

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Previously to the supply of the 
												said IBM Copier Machine by the 
												defendant/company to

												that the defendant/company would

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

												(1982 - 83) G.L.R. 1324 S.C. The

												&quot;Specific Performance of an

												(emphasis supplied).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												That being so I should have 
												thought that notions of 
												promissory estoppel did not 
												arise.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Indeed the genesis of the 
												doctrine of promissory estoppel 
												was aimed at curing the defect 
												of a promise made in the course 
												of an existing contractual 
												relationship which was not 
												supported by consideration. In 
												their erudite book, Cheshire, 
												Fifoot &amp; Furmston's Law of 
												Contract, (13th ed) the learned 
												authors state at pages 100 - 
												101, concerning the famous 
												decision of Denning, J. (as he 
												then was) in Central London 
												Property Trust Ltd. Vrs. High 
												Trees House Ltd. (1947) K.B. 
												130, as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The reasoning of the learned 
												judge is interesting. He agreed 
												that there was no consideration 
												for the plaintiffs' promise to 
												reduce the rent. If, therefore, 
												the defendants had themselves 
												sued upon that promise, they 
												must have failed. Their claim 
												would have depended upon a 
												contract of which one of the 
												essential elements was missing. 
												But where the promise was used 
												merely as a defence, why should 
												the presence or absence of 
												consideration be relevant? The 
												defendants were not seeking to 
												enforce a contract and need not 
												prove one. Was there, then, any 
												technical rule of English law 
												whereby the plaintiffs could be 
												prevented from ignoring their 
												promise and insisting upon the 
												full measure of their original 
												rights? At first sight, the 
												doctrine of estoppel would seem 
												to supply the answer. By this 
												doctrine, if one person makes to 
												another a clear and unambiguous 
												representation of fact intending 
												that other to act on it, if the 
												representation turns out to be 
												untrue, and if that other does 
												act upon it to his prejudice, 
												the representer is prevented or 
												'estopped' from denying its 
												truth. He cannot, as it were, 
												give himself the lie and leave 
												the other party to take the 
												consequences. The doctrine would 
												meet admirably the situation in 
												the High Treescase but for one 
												difficulty. In 1854 in Jordan v. 
												Money, a majority of the House 
												of Lords held that estoppel 
												could operate only on a 
												misrepresentation of existing 
												fact. Upon this basis it was 
												improper to apply it where, as 
												in the High Trees case, a party 
												sought to rely on a promise of 
												future conduct.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												To avoid this difficulty, 
												Denning, J. sought to tap a 
												slender stream of authority 
												which had flowed in equity since 
												the judgment of Lord Cairns in 
												1877 in Hughes v. Metropolitan 
												Rly. Co.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I shall return to the question 
												of promissory estoppel later. Is 
												the said collateral agreement 
												enforceable? I should think not. 
												It is trite law that for an 
												agreement to pass for an 
												enforceable contract it must be 
												certain, at least, as to its 
												essential terms. A collateral 
												contract has no special status. 
												As stated by Lord Moulton in 
												Heilbut, Symons &amp; Co. v. 
												Buckleton (1913) A.C. 30 at 47, 
												a collateral contract</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;is in every sense of the word a 
												complete legal contract. It is 
												collateral to the main contract, 
												but each has an independent 
												existence, and they do not 
												differ in respect of their 
												possessing to the full the 
												character and status of a 
												contract.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The agreement to provide the 
												after sale service &quot;for a fee&quot;, 
												simpliciter, is ambiguous. Thus 
												in the said Cheshire, Fifoot and 
												Furmston's Law of Contract, at 
												page 44 a reference is made to</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;... the tensions created by the 
												law's demand for a minimal 
												degree of certainty before it 
												will classify an agreement as a 
												contract. Since most contracts 
												are not negotiated by lawyers, 
												it is all too easy for the 
												makers to fail this test, 
												particularly as legal and 
												commercial perceptions of 
												certainty may well diverge. So a 
												lawyer would regard an agreement 
												that goods are to be supplied at 
												a reasonable price as prima 
												facie sufficiently certain but 
												would have much more doubt about 
												an agreement 'for a price to be 
												agreed between us.' Many 
												businessmen would be much 
												happier with the second 
												agreement than the first.&quot; 
												(emphasis supplied).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Apart from the element of fee, 
												it is quite clear that though 
												the plaintiff claims that the 
												agreement was concluded in 1977, 
												the parties kept on haggling 
												over its terms long afterwards. 
												Thus in Exhibit 6 at page 126 of

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Apart from this, estoppel, 
												including promissory estoppel, 
												is a shield and not a sword.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In Combe v. Combe (1951) 2 K.B. 
												215 at 220 Denning L.J. (as he 
												then was) said:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;In none of these cases was the 
												defendant sued on the promise, 
												assurance or assertion as a 
												cause of action in itself; he 
												was sued for some other cause, 
												for example, a pension or a 
												breach of contract, and the 
												promise, assurance or assertion 
												only played a supplementary 
												role, - an important role, no 
												doubt, but still a supplementary 
												role. That is, I think its true 
												function. It may be part of a 
												cause of action but not a cause 
												of action itself. &quot; (emphasis 
												supplied).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I think it is in this sense that 
												Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston's 
												Law of Contract states at page 
												103 that</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The doctrine operates only by 
												way of defence and not as a 
												cause of action.&quot; (emphasis 
												supplied).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												They however clarify this at 
												page 104 to the effect that the 
												metaphor in Combe v. Combe, 
												supra, that the doctrine must be 
												used as a shield and not as a 
												sword &quot;should not be sloppily 
												mistranslated into a notion that 
												only defendants can rely on the 
												principle. There is no reason 
												why a plaintiff should not rely 
												on it, provided that he has an 
												independent cause of action. So 
												if upon the facts of Hughes v. 
												Metropolitan Rly. Co, the 
												landlord had gone into 
												possession, putting the tenant 
												into the position of plaintiff, 
												the result would surely be the 
												same. On such facts the tenant's 
												cause of action would be the 
												lease and the doctrine would 
												operate to negative a possible 
												defence by the landlord that, he 
												was entitled to forfeit. As 
												Spencer Bower says: 'Estoppel 
												may be used either as a 
												minesweeper or a minelayer, but 
												never as a capital ship.' 
												(emphasis supplied).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Now the facts in Hughes v. 
												Metropolitan Rly. Co., (1877) 2 
												App. Cases 439 at 448 were that, 
												in October 1874 a landlord gave 
												his tenant six months' notice to 
												repair the premises. If the 
												tenant failed to comply with it, 
												the lease could be forfeited. In 
												November the landlord started 
												negotiations with the tenant for 
												the sale of the reversion, but 
												these were broken off on 31 
												December. Meanwhile the tenant 
												had done nothing to repair the 
												premises. On the expiry of six 
												months from the date of the 
												original notice the landlord 
												claimed to treat the lease as 
												forfeited and brought an action 
												of ejectment. The action failed. 
												Lord Cairns said at page 448 of 
												the Report:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;It is the first principle upon 
												which all Courts of Equity 
												proceed, that if parties who 
												have entered into definite and 
												distinct terms involving certain 
												legal results - certain 
												penalties or legal forfeiture - 
												afterwards by their own act or 
												with their own consent enter 
												upon a course of negotiations 
												which has the effect of leading 
												one of the parties to suppose 
												that the strict rights arising 
												under the contract will not be 
												enforced or will be kept in 
												suspense, or held in abeyance, 
												the person who otherwise might 
												have enforced those rights will 
												not be allowed to enforce them 
												where it would be inequitable 
												having regard to the dealings 
												which have thus taken place 
												between the parties.&quot; (emphasis 
												supplied).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The doctrine of promissory 
												estoppel has undergone expansion 
												and refinements. It is not 
												limited to only contractual 
												relationships. In DURHAM FANCY 
												GOODS LTD. V. MICHAEL JACKSON 
												(FANCY GOODS) LTD. (1968) 2 Q.B. 
												839 at 84, Donaldson, J. 
												commenting on the statement of 
												Lord Cairns quoted, supra, said:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Lord Cairns L.C. in his 
												enunciation of the principle 
												assumed a pre-existing 
												contractual relationship between 
												the parties, but this does not 
												seem to me to be essential, 
												provided that there is a 
												pre-existing legal relationship 
												which could in certain 
												circumstances give rise to 
												liabilities and penalties. &quot; 
												(emphasis supplied).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This principle was approved by 
												Denning M.R. in EVENDEN V. 
												GUILDFORD CITY ASSOCIATION 
												FOOTBALL CLUB LTD. (1975) 1 Q.B. 
												917 at 924 when he said:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Mr. Reynolds referred us, 
												however, to Spencer Bower and 
												Turner, Estoppel by 
												Representation, 2nd ed, (1966), 
												which suggests at page 340 - 
												342, that promissory estoppel is 
												limited to cases where parties 
												are already bound contractually 
												one to the other. I do not think 
												it is so limited: see Durham 
												Fancy Goods Ltd. V. Michael 
												Jackson (Fancy Goods) Ltd. 
												(1968) 2 Q. B. 839, 847. It 
												applies whenever a 
												representation is made, whether 
												of fact or law, present or 
												future, which is intended to be 
												binding, intended to induce a 
												person to act upon it and he 
												does act upon it,&quot; (emphasis 
												supplied) and I should warn, not 
												necessarily to his detriment.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												But for all this, the doctrine 
												of promissory estoppel has been 
												liberalised into a cause of 
												action in certain jurisdictions, 
												such as the United States and 
												Australia, see footnote 4 of 
												page 104 of Cheshire, Fifoot and 
												Furmston's Law of Contract, 13th 
												ed. It would however, seem that 
												in England and Ghana it can only 
												be used indirectly as a cause of 
												action where the plaintiff has 
												an independent cause of action, 
												as already stated supra, or as a 
												direct cause of action in the 
												limited situations of 
												proprietary estoppel. Thus in 
												QUIST V. GEORGE (1974) 1 G.L.R. 
												1 where a wife allowed her 
												husband, the defendant to build 
												a private hospital on her land, 
												Abban J. (as he then was), held 
												at page 14, in reference to the 
												defendant's counterclaim,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;I have no doubt that the kind 
												of estoppel which is available 
												to the defendant in the present 
												case, is more than a shield. In 
												other words, it can also be a 
												sword by which the person in 
												possession may, in certain 
												circumstances, compel the 
												conveyance to him of the legal 
												estate.&quot; (emphasis supplied).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Abban, J. however, on the facts 
												of that case, declined the 
												remedy of specific performance 
												by conveyance of the legal 
												estate to the defendant but 
												rather gave him a lease of 25 
												years. Similarly Cheshire, 
												Fifoot and Furmston's Law of 
												Contract states in footnote 5 as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;It seems that proprietary as 
												opposed to promissory estoppel 
												may in some cases support a 
												cause of action. See Crabb v. 
												Arun District Council [1976] Ch. 
												179, [1975] 3 All E.R. 865.&quot; 
												(emphasis supplied).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is the position, even 
												though, as stated in footnote 1 
												at page 103 of Cheshire, Fifoot 
												and Furmston's Law of Contract,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												'In Crabb v. Arun District 
												Council (1976) Ch. 179 at 193, 
												(1975) 3 All E. R. 865 at 875, 
												Scarman L.J. did not find the 
												distinction between proprietary 
												and promissory estoppel 
												valuable.&quot; (emphasis supplied).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Even if this view is accepted it 
												would still mean only a limited 
												class of promissory estoppel, 
												more conveniently known as 
												proprietary estoppel, could be a 
												direct sword rather than a 
												shield.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There is no element of 
												proprietary estoppel in this 
												case and the agreement of after 
												sales service being wholly 
												collateral to the original 
												contract of sale of the IBM 
												Copier Machine the plaintiff 
												could not and did not base its 
												action in this case on the 
												latter</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;as an independent cause of

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												to enable him use promissory

												fails.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In conclusion I hold that the 
												plaintiff in this case ought to 
												fail because in so far as its 
												action can be said to sound in 
												contract it lacks the requisite 
												certainty of terms to qualify 
												for enforcement by the courts, 
												and in so far as it is said to 
												be based on promissory estoppel 
												it is also misconceived for 
												uncertainty. It is further 
												misconceived for being a sword 
												rather than a shield.</span></p>

												The trial judge dismissed the

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Court of Appeal by a 
												majority (2-1) decision set 
												aside the judgment dismissing 
												the claim and case of Hasnem. 
												Judgment was entered for Hasnem. 
												The Court dismissed the appeal 
												by Hasnem against the 
												counterclaim and affirmed the 
												judgment in favour of I.B.M. on 
												its counterclaim. I.B.M. was 
												dissatisfied with the majority 
												decision of the Court of Appeal 
												and appealed to this court on 
												the following grounds:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;(a) the judgment was against 
												the weight of evidence on 
												record.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) the Court of Appeal erred in 
												rejecting findings of fact made 
												by the trial court which had the 
												benefit of observing the 
												demeanour of witnesses, and 
												substituting its own findings of 
												fact and thereby occasioning a 
												substantial miscarriage of 
												justice,&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In due course, Solicitors acting 
												for I.B.M. filed additional 
												grounds of appeal and argued 
												them to form part of the 
												statement of case.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The first observation I must 
												make is that Hasnem did not 
												claim a &quot;legal&quot; contract or 
												agreement. The claim of Hasnem 
												was founded on the rule of 
												equity; in this particular 
												instance, &quot;specific 
												performance&quot;. The 1992 
												Constitution provides at article 
												11(2) as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;11(2) The common law of Ghana 
												shall comprise the rules of law 
												generally known as the common 
												law, the rules generally known 
												as the doctrine of equity and 
												the rules of customary law 
												including those determined by 
												the Superior Court of 
												Judicature&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In my view, it would be palpably 
												wrong to apply principles and or 
												rules other than those generally 
												known as the doctrines of equity 
												in considering the case of 
												Hasnem. The majority of the 
												Court of Appeal adverted to this 
												issue when Acquah, J.A. (as he 
												then was) stated the law to be 
												applied as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The principal has been 
												described as a principle of 
												justice and equity, and is 
												extended to cover conduct. Thus 
												in Morgate vrs. Twitchings 
												(1975) 3 All E.R. 314 at 323 
												Lord Denning explained</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												'....... when a man by his words 
												or conduct has led another to 
												believe in a particular state of 
												affairs he will not be allowed 
												to go back on it when it would 
												be unjust or inequitable for him 
												to do so'. &quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The learned judge went further 
												to explain the true position of 
												parties in such circumstances as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The principle is that a promise 
												intended to be binding, intended 
												to be acted upon, and in fact 
												acted on should be binding. This 
												principle which Lord Denning 
												prefers to call promissory 
												estoppel in a number of his 
												cases include Evenden vrs. 
												Guildford Football Club (1975) 3 
												All E.R. 269 applies:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												'Whenever a representation is 
												made whether of fact or law, 
												present or future, which is 
												intended to be binding, intended 
												to induce a person to act upon 
												it and he does act upon it'.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The statement does not admit of 
												any ambiguity. I must point out 
												that the conditions or terms of 
												the promise need not be put down 
												in writing. The operative words 
												are promises made and, further, 
												evidence of conduct which 
												unequivocally and 
												incontrovertibly are consistent 
												with the promises.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In arguing original ground one 
												on the notice of appeal, learned 
												Counsel or IBM submitted that 
												Hasnem failed to prove the 
												existence of the oral agreement 
												between it and I.B.M. on the 
												evidence before the trial court. 
												He reproduced extracts selected 
												from the documents tendered in 
												evidence and sought to establish 
												that the claim of Hasnem was not 
												proved by these. In reply, 
												counsel for Hasnem contended 
												that the evidence adduced by 
												Hasnem proved and established a 
												contract for service and 
												maintenance of the machine. He 
												argued the contract was not one 
												for the supply of goods. He 
												recited the pieces if evidence 
												in support and proof of Hasnem's 
												case.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the address filed by counsel 
												for I.B.M. before the trial 
												judge the thrust of the case for 
												I.B.M. as put forward was 
												founded on and proved by Exhibit 
												&quot;1&quot;. This was how the argument 
												was presented by counsel for 
												I.B.M.:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Submits that the Plaintiffs 
												claim fails altogether so long 
												as the same is stated on Exhibit 
												&quot;1&quot;. Then he proceeded to the 
												conclusion&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												'submits that the fact that 
												defendants were from time to 
												time servicing plaintiff's 
												machine does not lead 
												irresistibly to an enforceable 
												contract between the parties'.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I note that in his address in 
												reply, Counsel for Hasnem did 
												not advert to the evidence 
												contained in Exhibit &quot;1&quot;, nor 
												did he comment on it. The trial 
												judge dutifully heeded the 
												invitation by Counsel for I.B.M. 
												and seriously considered the 
												evidential value of Exhibit &quot;1&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In considering the case of 
												Hasnem, the trial judge 
												expressed himself as follows: 
												&quot;Now to the plaintiff's claims 
												against the defendants, I shall 
												take the numerous correspondence 
												between the parties which the 
												plaintiff relied on as 
												constituting binding legal 
												agreements.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												After due and critical 
												examination and evaluation of 
												the &quot;numerous correspondence&quot;, 
												he concluded that the numerous 
												correspondence did not create a 
												binding contract between the 
												parties.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The majority of the Court of 
												Appeal considered and evaluated 
												all the evidence including the 
												evidence of PW1 and DW1 and held 
												that Hasnem proved the oral 
												agreement it entered into with 
												I.B.M. in 1977. In his 
												judgement, Acquah, J.A. (as he 
												then was) recited in great 
												detail the pieces of evidence 
												which weighed with him in 
												arriving at his decision when he 
												expressed his opinion as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Now there is no dispute that 
												the Plaintiff did buy the I.B.M. 
												Copier II Machine from the 
												defendant and that the 
												defendants are the manufacturers 
												of the said machines. There is 
												also no dispute that the only 
												maintenance services offered by 
												the defendants to their 
												customers are either maintenance 
												agreement or per call service; 
												and that from 1977, when the 
												plaintiff bought the machine, 
												the defendants provided per call 
												service maintenance to the 
												plaintiff up to at least 1984&quot;. 
												.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The above passage drew attention 
												to evidence on record, which the 
												trial judge failed and or 
												omitted to advert to in his 
												judgment. In addition to the 
												above matters, the trial judge 
												had before him evidence from PW1 
												which dealt at great length with 
												oral communication in 1977 
												between PW1 and a Mr. Osei 
												before he, PW1, agreed to buy 
												and Mr. Osei agreed to place an 
												order from outside Ghana for 
												Copier II Machine for Hasnem.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The case of I.B.M. was concluded 
												without evidence which 
												contradicted or disputed the 
												oral agreement of 1977. Mr. Osei 
												was not called to assist the 
												trial court. The omission of 
												failure of the trial judge to 
												advert to this incontrovertible 
												evidence from PW1 destroyed the 
												finding he made. The Court of 
												Appeal was right in examining 
												the evidence before it and 
												coming to its own conclusion.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The opinion of Brobbey, J.A. on 
												this issue expressed in his 
												dissenting judgment cannot be 
												supported in law because it was 
												not based on evidence on record. 
												On this issue he stated as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Assuming that there was any 
												oral contract for call service 
												the agreement came into being 
												in, 1977 when the machine was 
												bought.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In my humble opinion, the 
												appellate judge was not called 
												upon to make an assumption and 
												or to guess anything. His plain 
												duty was to evaluate the 
												evidence on record and make 
												findings of fact. Again the 
												appellate judge fell into error 
												when he expressed the opinion 
												following:</span></p>

												&quot;A contract to repair that

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												With great respect to the 
												appellate judge, the case of 
												Hasnem was a fairly simple one, 
												namely, an oral agreement 
												entered into in 1977 to the 
												effect that so long as the 
												Copier II was serviceable and 
												unless and until it was written 
												off as useless and 
												counter-productive, I.B.M. would 
												service and maintain it, and 
												payment made after servicing. 
												The trial judge and appellate 
												dissenting judge, with respect, 
												misdirected themselves when they 
												considered evidence, which was 
												not on record and relied on and 
												made assumptions in this matter. 
												They each erred in the view they 
												expressed that&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;such an agreement which was not 
												specific as to the period of 
												termination was determinable 
												after a reasonable 
												notice........ In his (trail 
												Judge's) estimation ten years 
												was reasonable. That ten years 
												suggestion was point of time in 
												respect of which the parties or 
												at least the appellants 
												witnesses should have 
												testified&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I have not understood the case 
												of Hasnem to be that it had 
												sought an order of specific 
												performance of an oral agreement 
												for a duration of ten years 
												between the parties commencing 
												in 1977. The evidence on record 
												does not support the finding by 
												the trial and dissenting 
												appellate judges, namely that 
												the contract or agreement, the 
												subject-matter in dispute was 
												for a period of ten years. The 
												finding by the dissenting 
												appellate judge expressed as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;I am of the view that the 
												appellant's claim for specific 
												performance failed because if 
												that claim were valid the 
												question understandably arose 
												was how long would that specific 
												performance last-for-ever&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												was not supported by evidence on 
												record. I have sought to show 
												that both the trial judge and 
												the dissenting appellate judge 
												misdirected themselves on the 
												evidence before the court; in 
												particular, the essential terms 
												and conditions of the oral 
												agreement entered into in 1977 
												between Hasnem and I.B.M. In my 
												view, the oral evidence of PW1 
												in relation to what transpired 
												in 1977, which was not 
												controverted nor disputed by 
												evidence from DW1 proved and 
												established the case of Hasnem.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Learned counsel for I.B.M. 
												submitted that since I.B.M. 
												sought an equitable relief it 
												must come to equity with clean 
												hands, mindful of the maxim that 
												he who comes to equity must do 
												equity. I agree that that is a 
												correct statement of law. He 
												agreed with Brobbey J.A. in his 
												dissenting opinion expressed as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The respondent (I.B.M.) was a 
												business organisation. Having 
												performed services which had not 
												been paid for how on earth did 
												the appellant expect it to 
												continue to render more service?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The point of relevance is that 
												until the appellant paid for the 
												services already rendered, the 
												respondent had no reason to 
												believe that future services 
												would be paid for.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I am amazed at the view of the 
												evidence taken by the appellate 
												judge. At paragraph 7 of the 
												amended statement of defence 
												I.B.M. averred in part as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;7....... each service call 
												could only be considered as an 
												independent request for services 
												and the same was fulfilled on 
												the basis of availability of 
												spare parts and the appropriate 
												man power&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The defence put forward did not 
												include the term or condition 
												&quot;subject also to the payment for 
												outstanding bills.&quot; It is rather 
												the honest business managing 
												director, PW1 who stated that 
												payment for bills for services 
												rendered was a term and 
												condition of the oral agreement. 
												In any case, the evidence before 
												the court was that I.B.M. had 
												stopped offering service from 
												1984 and was not prepared and in 
												a position to offer service and 
												maintenance on I.B.M. Copier II 
												Machines. I find that the 
												opinion expressed by the 
												dissenting appellate judge was 
												not supported by the evidence on 
												record. He fell into grave error 
												when he stated that I.B.M. could 
												justifiably refuse to offer 
												service and maintenance to 
												Hasnem on the ground that Hasnem 
												failed and or refused to pay 
												I.B.M. bills remaining unpaid. 
												The defence put forward was that 
												I.B.M. would attend to service 
												and maintain the machine of 
												Hasnem &quot;on the basis of 
												availability of spare parts and 
												the appropriate man power&quot;. The 
												appellate dissenting judge 
												failed and omitted to consider 
												this important defence put 
												forward by I.B.M. and came to 
												the wrong decision on this 
												issue.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Before the trial court, the 
												parties put in evidence numerous 
												documents. The trial judge as 
												well as the appellate judges 
												examined and considered some 
												only of these documents. Since a 
												ground of appeal complained 
												about the weight the majority 
												judges attached to these 
												documents, I must address the 
												issue raised here. It is 
												important in doing so to pay 
												attention to the dates on each 
												document and relate it to the 
												evidence on record touching upon 
												the oral agreement entered into 
												between Hasnem and I.B.M. in 
												1977. The exercise will assist 
												the court in appreciating and 
												understanding the case of each

												In his testimony before the

												Director repeated the contents 
												of Exhibit 'A'. I note that 
												I.B.M. failed and or omitted to 
												put in evidence the reply it

												Exhibit 'A' was evidence of an 
												earlier and prior arrangement or 
												agreement between the parties as 
												to dates on which Hasnem 
												expected I.B.M. to attend on it 
												to service and maintain the 
												Copier II machine. I am of the

												August 14 1982</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;On Friday, July 30 1982, the

												your Engineering Department 
												indications on our I.B.M. Copier 
												II Machine&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The indications were&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) The end P.C. light was on.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) After moving the P.C. switch 
												to 2, the call Key Operator and 
												end PC lights were still on.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3)&nbsp; The instruction on your 
												&quot;Key Operator&quot; Instruction 
												reads&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;If the light does not go out, 
												call I.B.M. Service&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												From the material, it cannot be 
												disputed that the &quot;Key Operator 
												Instructions&quot; imposed a binding 
												undertaking given to every 
												purchaser of that machine that 
												I.B.M. in the circumstances in 
												which Hasnem found itself, that 
												is, &quot;if the light does not go 
												off &quot;to promptly send an 
												employee with the requisite 
												expertise to attend Hasnem or 
												the purchaser. This instruction 
												would be deemed breached by 
												Hasnem or a purchaser if that 
												company called on a person other 
												than an engineer from I.B.M. The 
												reply from I.B.M. to Exhibit 'B' 
												was put in evidence as Exhibit 
												''2'. It read in part as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;All calls placed with our 
												engineering department are 
												scheduled and our customers are 
												handled on &quot;first come first 
												served&quot;. As a remote customer 
												without Maintenance Agreement, 
												you are expected to pay all 
												charges for calls made on you&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I do not understand this reply 
												to mean that Hasnem was not a 
												customer of I.B.M. The reply 
												made it clear beyond dispute 
												that Hasnem was a customer. That 
												Hasnem must take its place in 
												the queue in the matter of 
												servicing and that Hasnem must 
												pay for services after the same 
												had been rendered. The reply, 
												Exhibit '2', from I.B.M. did not 
												advise Hasnem to look else where 
												for an engineer for purposes of 
												carrying out the repair 
												occasioned by the fact that &quot;the 
												lights did not go off&quot; on its 
												machine. The letter Exhibit '2' 
												was written and signed by the 
												Branch Manager of I.B.M. a Mr. 
												J.E.A. Quansah. On this same 
												giving evidence for I.B.M., Mr. 
												Abraham Amoah, DW1 stated as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;We were servicing plaintiff's 
												Copier II Machine. When they 
												called us on the telephone or 
												sent somebody we received the 
												request and depending on the 
												resources available we undertook 
												to honour the invitation or 
												call&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												DW1 thus confirmed the existence 
												of the oral agreement.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												DW1 did not provide any evidence 
												to support the claim that on 
												particular occasions I.B.M. 
												refused or rejected a call from 
												Hasnem to service the Hasnem 
												Copier II Machine.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												At this point it is desirable to 
												advert to Exhibit '6' which was 
												referred to in his statement of 
												case for I.B.M. Learned counsel 
												argued as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;....... in fact the evidence on 
												record supports the defendants 
												position that there was no 
												binding standing agreement 
												between the parties and that 
												each service call was considered 
												and accepted or rejected by the 
												defendants on its own merits.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I therefore looked for evidence 
												on record including Exhibit '6' 
												in the light of the submission 
												that between 1977 and 1984 
												I.B.M. rejected calls from 
												Hasnem to attend and service the 
												Copier II machine. The evidence 
												before the trail court was that 
												I.B.M. did not breach the oral 
												agreement to service and to 
												maintain the - Copier II machine 
												entered into between the parties 
												in 1977. There was no evidence 
												on record that I.B.M. rejected 
												any call from Hasnem and failed 
												or neglected to attend to 
												service and maintain the copier 
												II machine. In my view learned 
												counsel for I.B.M. misconceived 
												the case before the court when 
												he based himself on Exhibit '6' 
												and argued as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;There is for example Exhibit 
												'6', which&nbsp; ..... stated:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Your letter is only asking us 
												to come and render services; 
												that does not include commitment 
												to pay for parts used and 
												expenses incurred such as travel 
												meals, an accommodation (if it 
												becomes necessary) .... )&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This argument does not and 
												cannot support and prove the 
												submission that I.B.M. had a 
												right or power to reject a call 
												by Hasnem to offer on I.B.M., 
												service and maintenance of the 
												customer's machine. The clear 
												and plain position of I.B.M. was 
												a readiness and a willingness to 
												attend all calls of Hasnem 
												subject only to the conditions 
												clearly spelt out above. Indeed 
												the case of Hasnem was not that 
												I.B.M. must service and maintain 
												the Copier II Machine free of 
												charge. I therefore find that 
												the evidence contained in 
												Exhibit '6' does not support the 
												case and claim of I.B.M. on that 
												issue.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On this issue the evidence of 
												DW1 left the trial court in no 
												doubt as to the real reason or 
												excuse from I.B.M. for its 
												refusal to service a customer's 
												machine in the following words&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;If a customer fails to pay our 
												bills we refuse to honour his 
												calls for service in future, 
												though we make effort to collect 
												the money&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is an admission that I.B.M. 
												was willing and ready to provide 
												maintenance services. According 
												to DW1 this policy of I.B.M. was 
												made clear to its customers. DW1 
												put in evidence Exhibit '7'. I 
												must necessarily draw attention 
												to the fact that Exhibit '7' 
												bears the date 14th October 1983 
												and not referable to an event in 
												1977. In the instant action, 
												Hasnem sued I.B.M. for breach of 
												an oral agreement entered into 
												between the parties in 1977 and 
												not one entered into in 1983. In 
												any case and indeed Exhibit '7' 
												contained the statement&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Please be assured of our prompt 
												attention at all times&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												which in my opinion was further 
												evidence supportive of the 
												existence of the contract to 
												offer service and maintenance to 
												Hasnem.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This was an undertaking given to 
												Hasnem by the Customer 
												Engineering Manager of I.B.M. a 
												Mr. Abraham Amoah in 1983 namely 
												the readiness and willingness of 
												I.B.M. to offer prompt service 
												to Hasnem and all customers 
												subject always to payment for 
												the services so rendered.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The above conclusion is also 
												supported by evidence contained 
												in Exhibit 'C' dated 30th June 
												1986 sent by Hasnem to I.B.M. 
												which in part reads as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;When the machine was purchased, 
												we were given an Assurance of 
												&quot;After Sale Service&quot; and whether 
												we entered into &quot;Maintenance&quot; or 
												operated on &quot;Per Call&quot; service 
												with your outfit, the said 
												I.B.M. Copier II Machine has 
												always been maintained by your 
												outfit&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I must point out that Exhibit 
												'C' is consistent in substance 
												with the Exhibit '7', which as I 
												have indicated elsewhere in this 
												opinion was written in October 
												1983. I reproduce the following 
												evidence from Exhibit 'C',</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The points raised in your 
												letter (dated April 16 1986) 
												under reply are indeed very 
												interesting. One fact we would 
												want you to bear in mind is that 
												Hasnem Enterprises Limited 
												bought an I.B.M Copier II 
												Machine from your outfit. 
												Whether the Copier II Engineer 
												has left I.B.M. or not that is 
												not Hasnem Enterprises Limited 
												concern. Our concern is that our 
												I.B.M. Copier Machine is 
												maintained....&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The evidence contained in 
												Exhibit 'C' was completely and 
												totally ignored by the trial 
												judge, especially when I.B.M. 
												did not offer any evidence to 
												contradict the serious 
												statements of fact supplied by 
												Hasnem for due consideration by 
												the trial court. Indeed Hasnem 
												expressed what it believed was 
												the agreement between it and 
												I.B.M. in Exhibit 'C' as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;If at the time of purchase of 
												the I.B.M. Copier Machine II you 
												have made us to understand that 
												at a certain stage we shall have 
												to maintain the said I.B.M. 
												Copier II Machine ourselves, we 
												are sure to have discarded the 
												idea of buying it.....</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As you are fully aware, I.B.M. 
												machines are serviced by 
												specially trained people with 
												specialist tools and parts 
												provided by I.B.M. World Trade 
												Corporation. Please tell us the 
												wayside or street side mechanic 
												who will easily and expertly 
												service I.B.M. Copier II 
												Machine&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The above piece of evidence from 
												Hasnem in my opinion established 
												the case of Hasnem that there 
												was at the date of the purchase 
												an agreement by I.B.M. to 
												service and maintain the 
												machine. I have not found 
												evidence from I.B.M. that it 
												turned down or refused to 
												service and maintain the Copier 
												II Machine between 1977 and 
												1986. The evidence of DW1 
												Abraham Amoah was not in my 
												view, an answer to the hard 
												facts stated by PW1. DW1 stated 
												as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Sometime in 1977 the 
												plaintiff's bought an I.B.M. 
												Copier II Machine from the 
												defendants. I am not aware the 
												defendants told plaintiff they 
												(defendants) would be 
												exclusively responsible for the 
												servicing of plaintiffs 
												machine&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												PW1 in his evidence named one 
												Mr. Osei the Sales Manager of 
												I.B.M. as the person who 
												negotiated the sale and purchase 
												with him. It does not lie in the 
												mouth of Amoah to give the 
												evidence he gave above. He did 
												not say he was present when 
												Hasnem bought the machine even 
												though he stated that he had 
												worked for I.B.M. since 1968. In 
												1977, DW1 was not the Sales 
												Manager of I.B.M. DW1 described 
												himself as Customer Engineering 
												Manager. DW1 did not claim he 
												had worked as a Sales Manager 
												for I.B.M. in 1977.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Be that as it may, DW1 testified 
												on 22nd March 1990 as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The plaintiffs did not enter 
												into any service maintenance 
												agreement of any form oral or 
												written with defendants&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The case of Hasnem was that it 
												entered into an oral agreement 
												with I.B.M. The trial court 
												should have rejected the above 
												piece of evidence as worthless, 
												since DW1 was not present to 
												witness that transaction; namely 
												the evidence of PW1 dealing with 
												and concerning the - 
												pre-purchase discussion; that is 
												to say, the placing of the order 
												for the machine; the delivery 
												and fixing of the machine in 
												Cape Coast and the verbal 
												guarantees and assurances made 
												to Hasnem at that time in 1977.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I agree and accept the trial 
												judge's rejection of DW1's 
												answer on the issue of the 
												&quot;green light not going off&quot;. 
												This was what DW1 told the trial 
												court under cross-examination:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Note: Witness shown Exhibit 'B' 
												and under 3 &quot;if the light does 
												not go out, call I.B.M. 
												service&quot;; he explains it means 
												the person should call a service 
												engineer, that is somebody who 
												is knowledgeable about the 
												I.B.M. product/machine. And 
												apart from I.B.M., there are 
												other individuals who are 
												trained and knowledgeable about 
												the produce&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Clearly this answer was on the 
												face of it dishonest. From 1977 
												up to 1986 the evidence before 
												the trial court was that only 
												I.B.M. had serviced and 
												maintained the machine Hasnem 
												bought from I.B.M. In my view 
												DW1 was not truthful to the 
												court in the matter of what a 
												purchaser of a Copier II Machine 
												should do if the lights on the 
												machine do not go off.&nbsp; The 
												clear and simple instruction 
												from the manufacturer was &quot;call 
												I.B.M. engineer&quot;. A reasonable, 
												prudent purchaser and owner 
												would and must call the I.B.M 
												engineer. I totally reject the 
												interpretation of the trial 
												judge when he stated thus&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;But the crucial question is, 
												did this (call IBM Engineer) per 
												se create a binding contract 
												legally enforceable against 
												I.B.M. .....</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Therefore I am of the view that 
												&quot;call I.B.M. Service&quot; should be 
												read to mean that if the user 
												has an existing maintenance 
												agreement or service agreement 
												with I.B.M. he should call on 
												the I.B.M. if the lights do not 
												go off. That will do justice to 
												the parties, case&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The instruction indicated on the 
												machine is plain and does not 
												require interpretation by the 
												trial judge. The trial judge 
												erred when he introduced and 
												added a fresh term and condition 
												to the instruction, that is, 
												&quot;that the user of the machine 
												must have an existing 
												maintenance agreement or service 
												agreement&quot; with I.B.M. In my 
												view it would be unwise for 
												Hasnem not to call upon I.B.M. 
												engineer if the light fails to 
												go off. The instruction was 
												directed at any and every person 
												who owned a Copier II Machine 
												whether or not such an owner had 
												any agreement written or oral 
												with I.B.M. If I.B.M. failed and 
												or neglected to respond to a 
												call to attend on any person 
												whose copier II machine 
												experienced a fault that the 
												lights do not go off the conduct 
												would no doubt give the owner a 
												cause of action against I.B.M.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the majority judgment of the 
												Court of Appeal Acquah, J.A. (as 
												he then was) stated his opinion 
												as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;if the trial judge had 
												critically adverted his mind to 
												this prior promise by Mr. Osei 
												of exclusive after-sale service 
												vis-a-vis the indications the 
												I.B.M. Copier II Machine itself 
												gives in the event of a fault to 
												wit call I.B.M. Service 
												Engineer, he would have 
												discerned the source of the 
												binding nature of the per call 
												service&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												He concluded thus:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; ....... it does not lie in the 
												mouth of the defendant to go 
												back on that promise. As Apaloo, 
												J.A. (as he then was) said in 
												Sasu vrs. Ayaduala (1973) 1 GLR 
												221 at 225:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;A party should be held to any 
												act or statement which it would 
												be unconscionable to permit him 
												to deny.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The learned judge also cited 
												S.26 of the Evidence Decree 1975 
												(Act 323) to buttress his 
												conclusion. He was right in 
												doing so.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I find further support for my 
												conclusion that the trial judge 
												misdirected himself on the case 
												put forward by Hasnem from the 
												following passage from his 
												judgment:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;It is the case of the plaintiff 
												that I.B.M. products are 
												exclusively maintained and 
												serviced by I.B.M. or their 
												appointed agents. That is a 
												trade policy or custom. The 
												defendants denied these facts.&quot; 
												.................</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I have carefully read through 
												the statement of claim filed by 
												Hasnem. I did not find that 
												Hasnem would rely on &quot;trade 
												policy or custom&quot; of I.B.M. The 
												case of Hasnem before the trial 
												judge was in part to be found in 
												the evidence of PW1 thus:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; ...... I expressed an interest 
												to purchase the machine called 
												I.B.M. Copier II from I.B.M. 
												Because of its high cost 
												I.B.M.'s Sales Manager by name 
												Mr. Osei told me they would have 
												to order for one from the United 
												Kingdom for me and I agreed&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I have found evidence on record 
												that indeed and in truth I.B.M. 
												placed an order for the said 
												machine. PW1 told the trial 
												court:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;they (IBM) placed an order for 
												me and when the machine arrived 
												the defendants came and 
												installed it in my office in 
												Cape Coast&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What PW1 related to the court 
												was what actually took place in 
												1977. In order not to leave the 
												court in any doubt, PW1 
												testified further as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Before the machine was 
												installed the defendants gave me 
												two specific instructions with 
												regard to its maintenance. They 
												explained maintenance agreement 
												to mean entering into an 
												agreement whereby I pay a 
												specific sum of money, so that 
												whenever the machine was faulty 
												I would call upon them to come 
												and service it. The after call 
												service meant whenever the 
												machine was faulty I would call 
												upon them to come and service it 
												and after the service I would 
												pay them upon payment of their 
												bills&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The above constituted what PW1 
												understood to be the obligations 
												respectively of the seller and 
												the purchaser. This evidence was 
												not disputed by I.B.M. Indeed 
												PW1 explained further in his 
												evidence-in-chief the true 
												position in 1977 at the date and 
												time the Copier II was installed 
												when he stated as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;......... they (Mr. Osei) told 
												me that irrespective of which 
												option I took, they would give 
												me satisfactory after sales 
												service because it was a very 
												expensive machine costing 
												¢33,000.00 at the time (1977) 
												and that I was the fifth person 
												in the country to have purchased 
												one in Ghana&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In order to complete the course 
												of dealing between Hasnem and 
												I.B.M. in the matter of the 
												maintenance of Copier II 
												beginning August 1977, PW1 
												testified as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;I started using the machine and 
												anytime it broke down I either 
												telephone or sent somebody to 
												tell them defendants and 
												immediately they came and 
												repaired it and sent the bills 
												which I satisfied ........&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In my view the undisputed and 
												unchallenged evidence from 
												Hasnem proved and established 
												its case; that from 1977 up to 
												1984 I.B.M., pursuant to the 
												oral agreement entered into with 
												it in 1977 serviced and 
												maintained the Copier II Machine 
												Hasnem purchased from that 
												company. I must also point out 
												that I.B.M. did not produce a 
												shred of evidence before the 
												trial court to establish that a 
												company, other than I.B.M., also 
												serviced and maintained Hasnem's 
												Copier II Machine during the 
												period 1977 and 1984. I find 
												that the trial judge misdirected 
												himself on the issue for 
												determination when he formulated 
												same thus:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;There are issues involved here 
												namely whether or not I.B.M. 
												products are exclusively 
												maintained and or serviced by 
												I.B.M. or their accredited 
												agents ......&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												With great respect to the trial 
												judge, the subject matter before 
												him was an I.B.M. II Machine.&nbsp; 
												He was not entitled to consider 
												and determine an oral agreement 
												about &quot;I.B.M. products&quot;. His 
												conclusion expressed in the 
												language following:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The plaintiff's own admission 
												makes it abundantly clear and I 
												find that it is not a trade 
												practice or policy of defendants 
												or is there any custom or usage 
												whereby products of defendants 
												are exclusively maintained and 
												or serviced by them&quot;, cannot 
												therefore be supported.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The I.B.M.'s letter dated 
												23-4-1982 and written by Mr. 
												J.E.A. Quansah and put in 
												evidence as Exhibit '2' 
												destroyed the conclusion reached 
												by the trial judge on the issue 
												of trade policy or custom of 
												I.B.M. The judgment based in 
												part on this finding cannot be 
												supported.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I cannot conclude this judgment 
												without pointing out that in my 
												humble view the trial judge 
												misdirected himself on the 
												defence put forward. In fine, 
												I.B.M. denied and disputed that 
												it agreed orally with Hasnem to 
												service and maintain the Copier 
												II Machine. The case is put 
												forward was in conflict with 
												that pleading in the statement 
												of defence. The evidence of DW1 
												illustrated his conclusion.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;I work with defendants as its 
												General Manager in Ghana. In 
												1986 the defendants were not 
												serving I.B.M. machines any 
												longer..... The last time we 
												officially worked on plaintiff's 
												machine was in September 1984&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The evidence in my view is an 
												admission of the case of Hasnem 
												that up to 1984 I.B.M serviced 
												and maintained his copier 
												machine but stopped and 
												neglected to do so because as a 
												company it had stopped that 
												particular business for good. 
												Briefly put, I.B.M. was no 
												longer in that time of business. 
												But before this close down, 
												I.B.M. had continued to service 
												and maintain the copier II 
												machine brought by Hasnem from 
												it. This in 23 April 1982. Mr 
												Quansah wrote in his capacity as 
												I.B.M. Branch Manager to Hasnem 
												in part as follows.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;As a remote customer without 
												Maintenance Agreement you are 
												expected to pay all charges for 
												calls made on you ...... We 
												endeavour to treat all our 
												valuable customers equally) 
												........ Please be assured that 
												despite the constraints on human 
												material resources we will 
												endeavour to provide an 
												indiscriminate level of service.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Yours faithfully,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Branch Manager.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Thus evidence painted the true 
												picture of the business 
												relationship between Hasnem and 
												I.B.M. from 1977 up to August 
												1982.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In his statement of case, 
												counsel for I.B.M. lamented the 
												fact the Court of Appeal imputed 
												dishonest conduct to IBM when it 
												stated that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;................ it would be 
												the height of dishonesty on the 
												part of the defendants to fault 
												the plaintiff from seeking 
												services from Mr. Amoateng, if 
												Mr. Amoateng was I.B.M. on his 
												own&quot; He argued that the I.B.M. 
												refused to the services rendered 
												by C.T.S. as evidence confirming 
												the absence of any binding 
												exclusive agreement, and the 
												freedom of Hasnem to service 
												their machine whatever they 
												chose. The argument of counsel 
												for I.B.M. overlooked the pieces 
												of evidence on record. These are 
												(1) that up to 1984 I.B.M. 
												serviced and maintained the 
												copier II Machine the 
												subject-matter before the court;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) that I.B.M. sent a circular 
												sometime in 1984, that it no 
												longer would service and 
												maintain copier II Machines;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3) that the copier II Machine 
												on the face of it warned and 
												instructed the owner in 
												possession of copier II Machine&quot; 
												to call IBM Engineer&quot; and</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(4) that the refusal of I.B.M. 
												to service and maintain Hasnem's 
												copier II Machine provoked the 
												instant action.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I agree entirely with the 
												conduct of Hasnem in the effort 
												it made to mitigate its 
												financial loss by resorting to 
												C.T.S. for its services. That 
												conduct is consistent with that 
												of reasonable and shrewd 
												businessman. By that conduct, 
												Hasnem must not be understood as 
												having abandoned its right to 
												sue I.B.M. for breach of an oral 
												agreement entered into between 
												the parties in 1977. When the 
												evidence on record is examined 
												in this light, it will be seen 
												that the fact that Hasnem in its 
												hour of desperation and 
												frustration turned to C.T.S. to 
												service and maintain its machine 
												contract was not to be seen as 
												not entered into the 1977 oral 
												between it and Mr. Osei acting 
												for and with full authority for 
												I.B.M. I am satisfied that the 
												decision of the majority of the 
												Court of Appeal was supported by 
												the evidence on record.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I.B.M. to whom Hasnem owed 
												¢58,213.04 for service and 
												maintenance sought to defend the 
												action on the other ground that 
												Hasnem owed it. I think that the 
												fact that Hasnem owed I.B.M. is 
												not a lawful excuse for it to 
												refuse to service and maintain 
												the said machine for the simple 
												reason that failure to pay for 
												services rendered was not an 
												agreed term for terminating the 
												oral agreement. The undisputed 
												evidence on record was that 
												Hasnem would pay for service and 
												maintenance of the machine. 
												I.B.M. did not adduce evidence 
												before the court to show and 
												establish that it I.B.M. had the 
												legal right to withhold service 
												and stop maintenance of Copier 
												II Machine in respect of which 
												there was unpaid bill or bills. 
												In this case, the reasons for 
												the failure or inability on the 
												part of the I.B.M. to service 
												and maintain were as I have 
												recited above. In the special 
												circumstances and on the 
												uncontroveted evidence Hasnem 
												proved and established its case. 
												It was entitled to judgment on 
												its claim. I will accordingly 
												dismiss the appeal. I will 
												affirm the majority decision of 
												the Court of Appeal.</span></p>
