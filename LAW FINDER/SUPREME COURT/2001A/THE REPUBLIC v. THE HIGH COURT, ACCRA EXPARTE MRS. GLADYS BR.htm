												On 8th May 2001, we unanimously 
												granted the applicant's prayer 
												for certiorari and consequently 
												quashed the proceedings and 
												orders of the Accra High Court 
												(Benin J.A) dated 12th May 2000 
												and 19th January 2001. We 
												reserved our reasons which we 
												now proceed to deliver.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Towards the latter part of the 
												1980's John K. Dolphyne took out 
												a writ of summons at the Sekondi 
												Circuit Court against Speedline 
												Stevedoring Co. Ltd. and S. E. 
												Brenya seeking damages for 
												fraud, and a declaration that he 
												is a member and Director of 
												Speedline Stevedoring Co. Ltd. 
												In the accompanying Statement of 
												Claim, Dolphyne averred that 
												sometime in October 1976, he and 
												three other named persons agreed 
												to established the Speedline 
												Stevedoring Company Ltd (herein 
												after referred to as the 
												Company). They invited Mrs. 
												Brenya to attend a company 
												meeting but she designated her 
												husband, Mr. Brenya to attend 
												instead. At that meeting, Mr. 
												Brenya was appointed company 
												secretary. The four Founders 
												were appointed the company's 
												Directors/Shareholders. He 
												averred further that he paid 
												¢15,000 for the company's 
												licence. The registration of the 
												company was entrusted to Mr. 
												Brenya. It was averred that Mr. 
												Brenya failed to carry out these 
												instructions and rather 
												fraudulently registered the 
												company without the inclusion of 
												Mr. Dolphyne's name as 
												shareholder. Besides he 
												fraudulently put down the names 
												of only himself and his wife as 
												the directors of the company. He 
												Dolphyne, was appointed to 
												oversee the company's operation 
												in Takoradi. It turned out that 
												when he discovered the fraud 
												committed by Mr. Brenya, two of 
												the company's founders namely 
												Messrs Oduro and Arthur made a 
												report to the Registrar General 
												who set up the one man Ntrakwah 
												committee. This committee 
												confirmed Mr. Brenya's fraud. 
												Hence the Circuit Court writ and 
												the reliefs sought.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Circuit Court gave him 
												judgement. There was an appeal 
												to the Court of Appeal, and 
												finally to the Supreme Court, 
												which on 29th January 1997 set 
												aside the reliefs for a director 
												and membership of the company on 
												grounds that a Circuit Court had 
												no jurisdiction to deal in 
												company matters. The Supreme 
												Court however confirmed the 
												damages of ¢3,000,000.00 for 
												fraud.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Thereafter Dolphyne adding the 
												company as 2nd Plaintiff in Misc 
												No. 768/97 issued a writ at at 
												the Accra High Court against Mr. 
												Brenya as 1st Defendant and Mrs. 
												Brenya as 2nd Defendant. 
												Speedline Stevedoring Co which 
												was 2nd plaintiff in this suit 
												was removed and made a 3rd 
												defendant. The reliefs claimed 
												by Mr. Dolphyne were:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												i.&nbsp; A declaration that the 
												plaintiff is the 
												Director/Shareholder of 
												Speedline Stevedoring Co, a 
												company plaintiff paid ¢15,000 
												for its licence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												ii.&nbsp; A declaration that the 
												resolution of the Board of 
												Directors of the said company 
												purporting to dissociate 
												plaintiff from directly or 
												indirectly connection with the 
												same is null and void.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												iii. Perpetual injunction 
												restraining the defendant his 
												servants, agents, privies 
												grantees and assigns form 
												interfering with the affairs of 
												Speedline Stevedoring Co. Ltd 
												until the determination of the 
												suit herein, and for an order of 
												receiver and manager of the said 
												company.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the following year, that was 
												1998, Mrs. Brenya and the 
												company in suit No CS 180/98 
												filed at the Accra High Court, 
												against Mr. Dolphyne and Mr. 
												Brenya claimed several reliefs 
												including:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Brenya claimed several reliefs 
												including:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;i.&nbsp; Declaration that by the 
												copy of the Regulations of the 
												Company duly registered at the 
												office of the Registrar General, 
												1st plaintiff has never been and 
												is not a director or shareholder 
												of the company and has no 
												capacity to be recognised or 
												hold himself as such.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												ii.&nbsp; Declaration that 1st 
												plaintiff was not a party in the 
												Accra High Court suit No. 662/79 
												taken by the two former 
												directors/shareholders and could 
												not use the settlement as res 
												judicata or estoppel against the 
												defendants or rely on the 
												settlement reached by the 
												parties to the said suit to the 
												detriment of defendants.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												iii. Declaration that the 1st 
												plaintiff was not part of the 
												complaint made by the two former 
												directors/shareholders Messrs, 
												Oduro and F. N. Arthur to the 
												office of the Registrar-General 
												and could not use the report as 
												res judicata or estoppel by 
												judgement against the defendants 
												herein.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												These two High Court suits were 
												consolidated, the proceedings 
												judgements and orders of which 
												are the subject matter of the 
												certiorari application which we 
												granted on 29th May 2000.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Now the facts grounding Mr. 
												Dolphyne 1997 suit, were the 
												very facts on which he launched 
												his Circuit Court case which 
												resulted in his being awarded 
												¢3,000,000.00 damages for fraud. 
												As the trial High Court observed 
												in his judgement of 12th May 
												2001.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; The material facts relied upon 
												by the parties were not 
												significantly different from 
												those in the earlier suit ... It 
												appears that Mr. Dolphyne was 
												prepared to rest his case on the 
												various court judgements put in 
												evidence in the action he took 
												against Mr. Brenya. His attorney 
												made this clear in 
												cross-examination.''</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Thereafter the High Court began 
												by referring to the Supreme 
												Court's judgement which accepted 
												the finding of fraud committed 
												by Mr. Brenya against Dolphyne, 
												and held that this fraud</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; relates to the formation, and 
												more particularly the 
												registration of the company's 
												shareholders and directors. So 
												the decision of the Circuit 
												Court was that Mr. Dolphyne was 
												entitled to be registered as 
												director and shareholder but was 
												fraudulently left out by Mr. 
												Brenya who was entrusted with 
												that responsibility.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial High Court then took 
												the view that in the 
												circumstances all that was left 
												for him to do was to examine the 
												findings of the Circuit Court, 
												especially as the proceedings 
												and judgement of that court were 
												all that the plaintiff relied on 
												before him. Accordingly he 
												said:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; Let me now turn to the 
												relevant findings of fact made 
												by the Circuit Court. I will 
												quote some of these findings in 
												order to save time. I shall 
												refer to other findings as and 
												when it becomes necessary.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Thereafter the Court pronounced 
												its decisions on the two 
												consolidated suits as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; In suit No. 768/97, relief 1 
												is allowed to this extend that 
												Dolphyne is declared to own 25% 
												shares in the company; he is 
												also declared to be a director 
												of the company along with Mrs. 
												Brenya. Reliefs 2 and 3 of the 
												said suit are dismissed. A final 
												decision on relief 4 will be put 
												off for the moment... The 
												counter claim by the company in 
												the said suit is disallowed... 
												So too is the counter claim by 
												Mr. and Mrs. Brenya in the said 
												suit also dismissed. The entire 
												claim by Mrs. Brenya in CS 
												180/98 is without merit and is 
												dismissed, except for what I 
												have adjudged to be her 
												entitlements in the company.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												He then adjourned the case for 
												six weeks for parties to sit 
												down</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; and talk about the future of 
												the company before any final 
												orders may be made. They should 
												take into account the overall 
												interest of the company, and in 
												the process a buy out may be 
												considered if that will help 
												them if they cannot co-operate 
												to let the company operate 
												successfully. They may also 
												discuss the question of 
												accounts, always bearing in mind 
												the overriding interest of the 
												company, so parties should 
												approach this exercise with an 
												open mind if they truly have the 
												interest of the company at 
												heart.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the next sitting of the court 
												which was the 19th January 2001, 
												the court made the following 
												orders:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; It is ordered that Mr. Antonio 
												Casto Barcom and Mr. J.K. 
												Dolphyne should take over the 
												management of the company from 
												the Receivers and Managers. The 
												receivers and managers will, 
												however, continue to sign the 
												company's cheques and notify the 
												two named persons up to the end 
												of January 2001. With effect 
												from 1.2.2001 these two persons 
												Dolphyne and Antonio will be 
												signatories to the company's 
												cheques. This order is to be 
												drawn up by the Registrar, and 
												signed by the judge himself and 
												copies sent to all the 
												appropriate agencies including 
												the banks with which the company 
												does business... The Receivers 
												and Managers are to meet with 
												Messrs Antonio and Dolphyne next 
												Tuesday, the 23rd day of January 
												and introduce them to the 
												relevant agencies and persons in 
												and around Accra-Tema. A similar 
												exercise is to be embarked upon 
												in Takoradi on Friday, 26th 
												January 2001.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												After this, the judge went on to 
												make an order for the payment of 
												¢20 million to each of the 
												lawyers of the parties as 
												settlement of their legal fees.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												He ordered:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; ... the receivers and managers 
												are to issue a cheque of ¢20 
												million to each of the three 
												lawyers, namely Dr. Seth Twum, 
												Dr. Ekow Daniel's and Mr. 
												Marful-Sam as part of their 
												fees. The rest of their fees if 
												any is to be settled by the 
												parties themselves.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What happens if the lawyer's 
												fees were less than ¢20 million, 
												one may ask? These orders are 
												certainly far beyond the scope 
												of the reliefs sought by the 
												parties. The judge completely 
												reorganised the affairs and 
												administration of the company 
												regardless of what is set down 
												in the company's regulations 
												registered with the Registrar of 
												Companies. Not surprisingly 
												therefore the applicants sought 
												certiorari to quash the 
												judgement and these orders as 
												perverse and made without 
												jurisdiction.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												To begin with, the judgement and 
												orders in question, as the trial 
												judge expressly stated, were 
												founded on the findings made in 
												the Circuit Court case which 
												ended up at the Supreme Court. 
												He was emboldened to rely on the 
												said findings because of his 
												view that both Brenya and the 
												company were parties to the said 
												suit and are therefore bound by 
												the findings made therein. Thus 
												after holding that Mr. Brenya 
												was a party and therefore bound 
												by the findings, he said of the 
												company:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;As for the company it was a 
												party to the Circuit Court case 
												and so was fully aware of the 
												nature of the case made against 
												Mr. Brenya which directly 
												affected the structure of the 
												company's shareholding and 
												directorship if it chose not to 
												assist Mr. Brenya. It cannot 
												claim to be affected by the 
												decision made&quot;. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Now for a judgement to operate 
												as res judicata, the said 
												judgement must be valid and 
												subsisting. In other words, it 
												must be a final judgement 
												delivered by a court of 
												competent jurisdiction. 
												Otherwise that judgement cannot 
												operate as res judicata to bind 
												the parties to it. Thus in 
												Spencer-Bower and Turner's Res 
												Judicata (2nd Ed) page 9 
												paragraph 9, the plea is thus 
												explained:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; Where a final decision has 
												been pronounced by a ... a 
												judicial tribunal of competent 
												jurisdiction, any party or privy 
												to such litigation, as against 
												any other party or privy 
												thereto, ... is estopped in any 
												subsequent litigation from 
												disputing or questioning such 
												decision on the merits whether 
												it be used as the foundation of 
												an action or relied upon as a 
												bar to any claim &quot; (emphasis 
												supplied).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the instant case, although it 
												is true that Mr. Brenya and the 
												company were parties to the 
												Circuit Court judgement, and 
												that the said Circuit Court 
												entered judgement for Dolphyne 
												for ¢3million damages for fraud, 
												and declared Dolphyne a 
												shareholder and director of the 
												said company, yet the Supreme 
												Court upheld only the ¢3million 
												damages for fraud and set aside 
												the declaration that Dolphyne 
												was a shareholder and director 
												of the company.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Thus in Dolphyne vrs. Speedline 
												Stevedoring (1996-97) SC GLR 514 
												at 519, the Supreme Court 
												stated:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; Reference to section 32 of Act 
												372 shows quite clearly that the 
												Circuit Court does not have 
												jurisdiction in matters 
												concerned with the Companies 
												Code 1963 (Act 179). Indeed by 
												section 2, schedule 1 thereof 
												unless the context so requires, 
												a court means the High Court, 
												therefore unless an applicant or 
												party to an action or 
												application in respect of 
												matters coming within the ambit 
												of the Companies Code 1963 can 
												demonstrate that there is some 
												other Law or even in the 
												Companies Code itself which 
												specifically confers 
												jurisdiction on the lower court, 
												there will be no&nbsp; jurisdiction 
												to entertain the matter. In the 
												present appeal nothing in the 
												record demonstrates that there 
												was jurisdiction in the circuit 
												court, and that part of the 
												action should have been 
												dismissed&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Accordingly the Supreme Court 
												dismissed claims (b) and (c) 
												dealing with membership and 
												shareholdership of the company 
												and set aside the Circuit 
												Court's decisions on these 
												reliefs. All the findings made 
												by the Circuit Court in 
												connection with those reliefs 
												similarly stood quashed. And the 
												High Court can not therefore 
												rely on them to enter judgement 
												that Dolphyne is a shareholder 
												and director of the company. In 
												Asiama vrs. Adjabeng (1971)2 GLR 
												17A CA, holding 1 of the 
												head-notes reads:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;there can be no estopple per 
												rem judicatem or by conduct 
												where the judgement pleaded has 
												been overruled or where the 
												subject matter of the dispute is 
												not covered by the judgement.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Such glaring error committed by 
												the High Court is sufficient to 
												vitiate the judgement and orders 
												of 12th May 2000 and 19th 
												January 2001.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Now what did the company per se 
												do to justify Mr. Dolphyne's 
												action against it? Now the case 
												of Dolphyne at the Sekondi 
												Circuit Court and in the High 
												Court suit Misc 768/97 as set 
												out earlier, was that in 1976 he 
												and three others decided to 
												establish a Stevedoring company. 
												At a meeting to discuss the 
												formation of this company, it 
												was agreed that he and the three 
												founders were to be made 
												shareholders and directors, and 
												Mr. Brenya secretary and 
												entrusted with the 
												responsibility of registering of 
												the company. But Brenya did not 
												register him as a shareholder 
												and director. Hence his claim 
												for damages for fraud against 
												Brenya, and a declaration that 
												he is a director/shareholder of 
												the company.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Clearly then Mr. Dolphyne's 
												complaint relates to a contract 
												or a transaction which happened 
												before the incorporation of 
												Speedline Stevedoring Co. Ltd. 
												and therefore governed by the 
												law on pre-incorporation 
												contracts.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The common law rules on this are 
												the same both for public and 
												private companies. No legal 
												person, natural or artificial, 
												can contract before he or it 
												exists. Therefore, a contract 
												made by a promoter on behalf of 
												the company before incorporation 
												never binds the company, because 
												the company is not yet formed. 
												It has no legal existence. Even 
												if the parties act on the 
												contract, it will not bind the 
												company: Re Northumberland 
												Avenue Hotel Co. (1886) 33 Ch. 
												D. 16.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Section 13 of the Companies 
												Code,1963 (Act 179) dealing with 
												pre-incorporation contracts, 
												provides:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; 13(1) Any contract or other 
												transaction purporting to be 
												entered into by a company prior 
												to its formation or by any 
												person on behalf of the company 
												prior to its formation may be 
												ratified by the company after 
												its formation; and thereupon the 
												company shall become bound by 
												and be entitled to the benefit 
												thereof as if it had been in 
												existence at the date of such 
												contract or other transaction 
												and has been a party thereto.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2)&nbsp; Prior to ratification by a 
												company the person or persons 
												who purported to act in the name 
												or on behalf of the company 
												shall, in the absence of express 
												agreement to the contrary, be 
												personally bound by the contract 
												or other transaction and shall 
												be entitled to the benefit 
												thereof.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Thus unless it is established 
												that the company ratified the 
												pre-incorporation agreement to 
												have Dolphyne as director and 
												shareholder; the company cannot 
												be sued to enforce the terms of 
												that agreement. Consequently the 
												action against the company is 
												misconceived and misdirected.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Speedline Stevedoring Co. Ltd., 
												from the records,is a private 
												company registered under the 
												Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179), 
												and therefore subject to the 
												provisions of this Code. The 
												Code regulates, inter alia, how 
												the membership, directorship and 
												shareholdings of a private 
												company can be effected. Section 
												30 of the Code states that one 
												becomes a member of a company by 
												subscribing to its Regulation. 
												And that in the case of a 
												company with shares each member 
												shall hold at least one share. 
												Then section 30(5) provides:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;membership of a company with 
												shares shall continue until a 
												valid transfer of all the shares 
												held by the member is registered 
												by the company, or until all 
												such shares are transferred by 
												operation of law to another 
												person or forfeited for 
												non-payment of calls under a 
												provision, in the Regulations, 
												or until the member dies.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is indeed interesting to 
												imagine how in the case of a 
												private company like the 
												Speedline Stevedoring Co, 
												someone who has not subscribed 
												to the regulations of that 
												company, has not taken shares, 
												and has not consented in writing 
												to be a director, may be imposed 
												on that company as a shareholder 
												and director simply because the 
												one who processed the 
												registration of that company 
												refused to register him as a 
												shareholder and director. And 
												the situation becomes absurd 
												when one appreciates that the 
												complainant had, for the refusal 
												to register him as such, already 
												been awarded ¢3million damages.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The alleged fraudulent behaviour 
												of Mr. Brenya was between 
												Dolphyne and this Brenya, and 
												the award of damages ended the 
												matter. The company was not a 
												party, neither was Mrs. Brenya, 
												a party to the fraud. The claim 
												for a shareholdership and 
												directorship of the company 
												based on the fraudulent 
												behaviour of Mr. Brenya cannot 
												therefore be justified either at 
												common law or in the face of 
												section 13 of Act 179.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Now the High Court having 
												improperly made Dolphyne a 
												shareholder, when Dolphyne has 
												no share in the company, 
												proceeded illegally to allot 25% 
												of the shares of Mrs. Brenya to 
												Dolphyne. Section 95 of the Code 
												prohibits the transfer of shares 
												without the consent of the 
												shareholder. Section 42(1) and 
												45 dealing with payment of 
												shares provide:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; 42(1) Expect on a 
												capitalisation issue pursuant to 
												subsection (1) of section 47 of 
												this code, shares shall not be 
												issued other wise than for 
												valuable consideration paid or 
												payable to the company and 
												unless otherwise agreed shares 
												shall be paid for in cash.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												45. Shares shall not be deemed 
												to have been paid for in cash 
												except to the extent that the 
												company shall actually have 
												received cash therefor at the 
												time of, or subsequently to, the 
												agreement to issue the shares; 
												and where shares are issued to a 
												person who has sold or agreed to 
												sell property or rendered of 
												agreed to render services to the 
												company or to persons nominated 
												by him the amount of any payment 
												made for the property or 
												services shall be deducted from 
												the amount of any cash payment 
												made for the shares and only the 
												balance, if any, shall be 
												treated as having been paid in 
												cash for such shares 
												notwithstanding any exchange of 
												cheques or other securities for 
												money.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The orders of the High Court 
												clearly fell fowl of these and 
												other provisions of the Code.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												We are accordingly satisfied 
												that once the Sekondi Circuit 
												Court had no jurisdiction to 
												deal with matters affecting 
												companies registered under the 
												Code, the findings of that 
												cannot be relied upon to ground 
												a judgement for Dolphyne. 
												Furthermore since the matters 
												complained of took place before 
												the registration of the company, 
												the company cannot be held 
												responsible in the absence of 
												express ratification of that 
												transaction. The orders of 19th 
												January 2001 were in flagrant 
												violation of the provisions of 
												the Company's Code. For a High 
												Court can appoint receivers and 
												managers to manage the affairs 
												of a company but the Court 
												cannot, after revoking their 
												appointment, purport to appoint 
												directors and determine which 
												particular directors should sign 
												the cheques of the company. The 
												Code does not give a High Court 
												such jurisdiction. Hence, our 
												unanimous decision quashing the 
												judgement and orders of the High 
												Court dated 12th May 2000 and 
												19th January 2001.</span></p>
