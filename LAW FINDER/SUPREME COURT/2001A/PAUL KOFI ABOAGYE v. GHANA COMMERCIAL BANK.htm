												JOYCE BAMFORD-ADDO, J.S.C.:
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is an appeal against the 
												judgment of the Court of Appeal 
												dated 26th November 1998 
												reversing a judgment of the 
												Accra High Court dated 28th May 
												1997. Dissatisfied with the said 
												judgment of the Appeal Court, 
												Appellant filed another appeal 
												to the Supreme Court. The 
												grounds of appeal are:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;a)&nbsp; The judgment was against 
												the weight of evidence adduced 
												and against natural justice</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&nbsp;b)&nbsp; The cost awarded was 
												excessive.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&nbsp;c)&nbsp; Other grounds will be filed 
												when the Record of Appeal is 
												ready&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The facts of the case are as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellant herein was 
												plaintiff in the case before the 
												High Court. The defendant was 
												the Commercial Bank, employer of 
												the plaintiff. The plaintiff 
												sued the Defendant and won his 
												case at the High Court, but the 
												Appeal Court reversed that 
												decision and he has now appealed 
												to this court. He would be 
												hereinafter be referred to as 
												plaintiff and the bank as 
												defendants. The plaintiff's 
												claim against the defendant was 
												for:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A declaration that his purported 
												dismissal with loss of benefits 
												from his employment with the 
												defendant by the Board of the 
												Defendant which was communicated 
												to him by the General Manager on 
												or about the 4th November, 1994 
												was ultra vires, null and void 
												and ought to be set aside.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In his Statement of Claim (p.2 
												of the Record) plaintiff pleaded 
												that when he was appointed by 
												the defendant it was a condition 
												in the defendant's offer of 
												appointment that, on acceptance, 
												the plaintiff would be deemed to 
												have agreed that his employment 
												would be governed by the Staff 
												Service rules (Exhibit B at 
												77-82 of the Record). He further 
												pleaded that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the 4th of November 1994, the 
												defendant purported to summarily 
												dismiss him the plaintiff from 
												the said employment with 
												consequential loss of earnings 
												allegedly for unspecified and 
												unproven acts of misconduct by a 
												written Memorandum signed by the 
												General Manager and Deputy Head 
												of Human Resources and 
												Development on behalf of the 
												Board of the defendant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Particulars of Wrongful 
												Dismissal were that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) The plaintiff was condemned 
												by being&nbsp; summarily dismissed by 
												the Board of the Defendant Bank, 
												and in blatant violation of its 
												own staff rules and in 
												contravention of the rules of 
												natural justice. That the 
												plaintiff was not allowed to 
												hear the evidence brought 
												against him let alone to rebut 
												the case against him. </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) That the body which 
												purported to dismiss the 
												plaintiff was under a duty to 
												act judiciously and fairly, yet 
												it dismissed the plaintiff 
												administratively.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3) That by the provisions of 
												the Staff rules 4.1, he should 
												have been tried for the alleged 
												misconduct by an unbiased 
												disciplinary committee in the 
												exercise of its judicial 
												functions after he had been 
												given notice of the charges of 
												misconduct and the right to be 
												heard in answer to the charges.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(4)&nbsp; Rule 4.2 states that after 
												the hearing which did not take 
												place the Disciplinary Committee 
												should have drafted its 
												recommendations to the Executive 
												Committee in a logical 
												judgment-like fashion by giving 
												cogent reasons for its 
												conclusions.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(5)&nbsp; That under Rule 4.3, the 
												Executive Committee had power to 
												confirm or vary the finding of 
												the Disciplinary Committee. It 
												also had power to give the 
												plaintiff a hearing.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(6)&nbsp; That by rule 4.4, the 
												plaintiff had a right of appeal 
												to the Board of the Defendant 
												Company.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(7) By Rule 7.3, the Board had 
												jurisdiction to exercise 
												Appellate jurisdiction. It is 
												therefore contended that the 
												Board did not have original 
												jurisdiction to dismiss the 
												plaintiff. Even if it did, which 
												is denied, the decision of the 
												Board was arrived at in 
												contravention of the rules of 
												natural justice and hence ought 
												to be set aside. For even if the 
												Board had original jurisdiction 
												to discipline the plaintiff, the 
												Board was under a duty to act 
												judicially, which it failed to 
												act as such. The defendant was 
												unable to prove any act of 
												misconduct.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The defendant denied each and 
												every allegation of fact 
												contained in the plaintiff's 
												Statement of Claim.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The case was tried at the High 
												Court Accra after which the 
												Trial Judge gave judgment for 
												the plaintiff on 28th May 1997. 
												This judgment of the High Court 
												was reversed on appeal by the 
												Court of Appeal and dissatisfied 
												with this the 
												plaintiff/appellant herein has 
												appealed to the Supreme Court on 
												the following two grounds of 
												appeal. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												1.&nbsp; That the judgment was 
												against the weight of evidence 
												adduced and </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2. That the disciplinary 
												authorities of the defendant 
												bank failed to observe the rules 
												of natural justice</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The rule of natural justice as 
												defined in Osborns Concise Law 
												Dictionary is as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The courts in the interest of 
												fairness impose certain 
												obligations upon those with 
												power to take decisions 
												affecting other people. These 
												obligation arise from the rules 
												of natural justice which 
												although &quot;sadly lacking in 
												precision have generally been 
												subsumed under two heads, the 
												audi alteram partem&quot; rule and 
												the &quot;nemo judex in sua&quot; rule. By 
												virtue of these rules decision 
												makers must act fairly, in good 
												faith and without bias and must 
												afford each party the 
												opportunity to adequately state 
												his case&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Natural justice is actually 
												fairplay in action and is 
												applicable to the ordinary 
												courts, adjudicating tribunals 
												and administrative bodies which 
												have the power to adjudicate in 
												disciplinary cases, and which 
												make decisions affecting rights 
												of other persons. In other 
												words, the fundamental rules of 
												natural justice include trial 
												and strict adherence to the 
												rules of procedure applicable to 
												the proceedings.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In Spackman v. Plumstead 
												District Board of Works (1885) 
												10 App. Case P.299 at 240 Lord 
												Selbournce said:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;There would be no decision 
												within the meaning of statute if 
												there were anything of that sort 
												done contrary to the essence of 
												justice&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It has long been held in many 
												cases that a decision which 
												offends against the principle of 
												natural justice is outside the 
												jurisdiction of the 
												decision-making authority see 
												also AG vr. Ryan (1980) AC 718. 
												The requirements that the rules 
												of natural justice be applied by 
												adjudicating authorities even 
												where it is not stated in any 
												law should be implied by those 
												authorities. Lord Russel in 
												Fairmount Investments Ltd. v. 
												Sec. Of State for the 
												Environment (1976) 1 W.L.R. 1255 
												at 1263 said</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												''...... it is to be implied, 
												unless the contrary appears, 
												that Parliament does not 
												authorise by the Act the 
												exercise of powers in breach of 
												the principles of natural 
												justice, and that parliament 
												does by the Act require in the 
												particular procedures, 
												compliance with those 
												principles.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As stated also in Wiseman v. 
												Bornemen (1971) AC 297 per Byles 
												J.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;It seems to me that the board 
												are wrong whether they acted 
												judicially or ministerial, I 
												conceive they acted judicially 
												because they had to determine 
												the offence, and they had to 
												apportion punishment as well as 
												the remedy. That being as a long 
												cause of decisions beginning 
												with Dr. Bentey's case and 
												ending with some very recent 
												cases establish that although 
												there are no positive words in a 
												statue requiring that the party 
												shall be heard yet the justice 
												of the Common Law will supply 
												the omission of the legislature&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Therefore all Judicial 
												administration decisions made in 
												breach of the audi alteram 
												Partem rule would be null and 
												void. The application of the 
												rules of natural justice is so 
												fundamental to fair procedure 
												and even includes the rule 
												against bias since if only one 
												party in a dispute is heard, the 
												other would be seriously biased 
												and so the final decision would 
												be useless, that other party 
												would have been unjustly 
												condemned without hearing his 
												side of the case. In such a case 
												it cannot be said that there had 
												been fair administration of 
												justice when in fact in such a 
												case there would have been no 
												justice at all. However it is 
												not necessary that the procedure 
												to be followed in a hearing by 
												administrative bodies and 
												tribunals should be based on 
												that of a court proceedings, the 
												hearing need not always be an 
												oral hearing, provided the rules 
												of procedure which bind the 
												administrative authority does 
												not require &quot;personal hearing&quot;. 
												Where personal hearing is 
												required as in Rule 4:3 of the 
												Bank rules stated above, the 
												accused official must be heard 
												personally. Further the general 
												notion of a fair hearing extends 
												to the right of a person accused 
												to have notice of the actual 
												charge against him i.e. by 
												serving him with charges and by 
												giving him the opportunity to 
												present his defence, based on 
												evidence provided in support of 
												the charge against him.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As said by Lord Denning of 
												administrative bodies in the 
												case of Abbot v. Sullivan (1952) 
												1KB 189.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;These bodies, however, which

												They must not condemn a man 
												without giving him an

												practices to the contrary would 
												be invalid&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In this case the administrative 
												body trying the plaintiff, who 
												suffered the highest and 
												toughest sanction of dismissal, 
												should in the cause of fair 
												trial have been served with 
												proper disciplinary charges and 
												given adequate notice of the 
												date of hearing as well as be 
												given the opportunity to be 
												heard. The mere fact that the 
												rules of the Bank did not 
												mention this does not relieve 
												defendant of the duty to comply 
												with the rules of natural 
												justice and fair trial. Just as 
												in a civil proceeding proper 
												service of notice on a defendant 
												is a condition precedent to a 
												fair trial so also in this case 
												a proper notice to plaintiff is 
												a sine qua non to a fair hearing 
												of the case against him. If this 
												is neglected to be done a final 
												decision would be declared a 
												nullity.</span></p>

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Article 19(3)&nbsp; An adjudicating

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As can be seen from Article 
												19(1) and (3) all courts and

												required to give a fair hearing, 
												this requires that notice of 
												proceedings be given to the 
												person affected by any decision 
												of the adjudicating authority 
												and that he be given the 
												opportunity to defend himself. 
												Furthermore, Article 23 says 
												that administrative bodies and

												acting fairly implies the 
												application of the rules of 
												natural justice which have been 
												elevated to constitutional 
												rights and are binding on all

												Consequently the Defendant Bank

												that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Whenever people were given 
												power by law to consider facts 
												and to arrive at conclusions 
												affecting the fate of human 
												beings, they were performing a 
												quasi-judicial function and if 
												the body violated the rules of 
												natural justice the courts had 
												power to declare the procedure 
												invalid, as well as the 
												conclusions there from. In the 
												present case the administrative 
												inquiry violated the two 
												cardinal principles of natural 
												justice namely a man must not be 
												judged in his own case. Since 
												the evidence showed that the 
												respondents were threatened with 
												incarceration if they did not 
												give answers the investigators 
												expected to hear, and they were 
												also not given the chance to 
												confront their accusers, nobody, 
												given such a trial could 
												seriously be said to have been 
												heard. And since the members of 
												the committee of inquiry 
												included the same people who 
												arrested the plaintiffs and sent 
												them to the Police Station 
												members who were very much 
												interested in the subject, they 
												were investigating, they were in 
												the position of the accusers 
												being made judges in their own 
												case, consequently both the 
												inquiry and the dismissal of the 
												respondents were unlawful. R v.

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Since the Disciplinary

												their decision to dismiss the

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellant complaints that 
												the rules of natural justice 
												wave breached by the defendants' 
												disciplinary authority, in that 
												Ghana Commercial Bank Ltd. Staff 
												Service Rules effective 16th 
												September 1994 &quot;Exhibit B&quot; were 
												not complied with by defendant, 
												which also failed to apply the 
												rules of natural justice in the 
												disciplinary proceed taken 
												against him resulting in his 
												dismissal from the bank. 
												Considering the facts of this 
												case this is a legitimate 
												complaint. The facts are that 
												plaintiff received two queries 
												from the Inspector/Audit 
												Division of the bank on 25th 
												March 1994 about the plaintiff's 
												signature on Draft No. 177036 
												dated 17-7-92 for authorising 
												the payment of £15,000.00 and 
												also a cable authorising payment 
												of US$13,559.60 on behalf of 
												White Chapel in &quot;Exhibit E&quot; and 
												in &quot;Exhibit G&quot; and was asked to 
												give reasons why internal 
												entries were not passed to the 
												debit of customer's account or 
												show the vouchers passed to give 
												effect to the payment made on 
												behalf of customers. Plaintiff 
												replied to these queries in 
												&quot;Exhibits F and H&quot; but was 
												afterwards immediately suspended 
												by letter from the Human Res. &amp; 
												Dev. Division. The letter was 
												signed by the General Manager 
												and the Deputy head of the said 
												Division on 31st March 1994 see 
												&quot;Exhibit J&quot;. On 7th April 1994 
												the plaintiff and other 
												officials were told by the 
												Managing Director that they were 
												being taken to BNI for 
												interrogation in respect of 
												alleged fraudulent transfers. 
												The plaintiff was accordingly 
												interrogated by the BNI. The 
												findings of BNI were embodied in 
												a 25-page report, which 
												contained a detailed account of 
												the investigation carried out in 
												&quot;Exhibit K&quot;. This report 
												incidentally exonerated the 
												plaintiff at p.22 of the report 
												as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Paul Kofi Aboagye cannot also 
												been held liable for acting his 
												good faith and performing a duty 
												within his competence.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												After receiving the BNI report 
												the Disciplinary Committee of 
												the Bank initiated disciplinary 
												proceedings under Rule 4:1 of 
												the said Staff Service Rules in 
												Exhibit B. Then the Disciplinary 
												Committee without serving any 
												charges or giving notice or 
												affording a hearing to 
												plaintiff, sent its 
												recommendation to the Executive 
												Committee see &quot;Exhibit M&quot; which 
												says of the plaintiff:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Messrs P. K. Aboagye and 3 
												others</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The above-named four officers 
												counter-signed some drafts/telex 
												messages without satisfying 
												themselves about the genuineness 
												of the transactions. The 
												committee noted that the drafts 
												and telex messages were only 
												counter-signed by the four and 
												did not originate them. Some of 
												the funds remitted are still 
												outstanding&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The report continued:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;MISCONDUCT</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												For being negligent and failing 
												to take necessary precautions to 
												protect the interest of the 
												bank, the committee recommends 
												that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The plaintiff and 3 others:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												i)&nbsp; Should be warned for 
												negligence of duty (See Rule 
												3(4) of &quot;Exhibit B&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												ii)&nbsp; Their salaries should be 
												reduced to the first notch of 
												their present scale&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The above recommendations were 
												referred to the Executive 
												Committee in &quot;Exhibit N&quot;. The 
												Executive committee also 
												recommended that &quot;Mr P. K. 
												Aboagye should be warned for 
												negligence of duty and be 
												reduced by four (4) notches of 
												his grade&quot;. This is an increase 
												in plaintiffs' punishment. 
												Afterwards a report of the 
												Executive Committee went to the 
												Board see Exhibit L&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												And in the minutes of the bank 
												it can be seen that the Board 
												decided as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Mr. P. K. Aboagye should be 
												dismissed from the service of 
												the Bank and action taken to 
												recover all lost monies&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Consequently, on 4th November 
												1994 a written memorandum signed 
												by the General Manager and the 
												Deputy Head of Human Resources 
												and Development Division of the 
												Bank was addressed to the 
												plaintiff in &quot;Exhibit C&quot;, to the 
												plaintiff which stated that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The Board at its meeting held 
												on 27th October 1994 noted the 
												extent of your involvement in 
												the malpractices at our Foreign 
												Operations Branch and decided 
												that you should be dismissed for 
												gross misconduct. You are 
												accordingly dismissed from the 
												service of the bank 
												forthwith...&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the 28th November 1994 the 
												plaintiff petitioned the Board 
												in &quot;Exhibit D&quot; for 
												reconsideration of the decision 
												but on the 15th October 1995, 
												the plaintiff received the 
												results of his petition, to the 
												effect that his petition has 
												been refused by the Board.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The plaintiff thereupon 
												initiated action at the High 
												Court. It is the case of the 
												plaintiff/appellant that there 
												had been breaches of the rules 
												of natural justice with regard 
												to the disciplinary proceedings 
												against him, and the trial court 
												held that for that reason the 
												plaintiff's dismissal was 
												unlawful. But on appeal by the 
												defendant bank to the Court of 
												Appeal, the said court reversed 
												the trial courts decision and 
												found for the defendant bank 
												i.e. Ghana Commercial Bank. It 
												was the case of the plaintiff 
												the General Manager (Human 
												Resources and Development 
												Division) who suspended the 
												plaintiff on the 31st March 1994 
												is the same person who was a 
												member of the disciplinary 
												committee established under Rule 
												(5) 1 of the Staff Rules.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Also that the representative of 
												Inspector/Audit Division who 
												investigated and queried the 
												plaintiff and received his 
												explanation also served on the 
												Disciplinary Committee and that 
												in the result the same two 
												people who investigated the 
												conduct of the plaintiff&nbsp; 
												prosecuted him also sat in 
												judgment over him. By this 
												submission the plaintiff was 
												saying that there had been a 
												breach of the maxim &quot;nemo Judex 
												in Sua&quot; rule namely that &quot;No man 
												should be a judge in his own 
												cause. This rule is designed to 
												eliminate bias and to ensure 
												fairness in the hearing of a 
												case against an alleged 
												offending persons facing a 
												disciplinary inquiry. This is a 
												legitimate complain as can be 
												seen, in the case of Cooper v. 
												Wilson (1937) 2 KB 39 where it 
												was held that the presence of a 
												Chief Constable with the Watch 
												Committee during the hearing of 
												an appeal of a Police Sergeant 
												who had been dismissed by his 
												chief was fatal to the validity 
												of the Watch Committees 
												decision.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Lord Justice Scott said:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The risk that a respondent may 
												influence the court is so 
												abhorrent in English notion of 
												justice that the possibility of 
												it, or even the appearance of 
												such a possibility is sufficient 
												to deprive the decision of all 
												judicial force and to render it 
												a nullity. The procedure adopted 
												by the bank breached the rule of 
												&quot;Nemo judex in sua&quot; rule, a part 
												of the rule of natural justice&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In this case also the people who 
												charged him and suspended him 
												and who had an interest in the 
												case tried and convicted him. 
												This is a breach of the rule of 
												natural justice, that accusers 
												cannot be judged in their own 
												cause. For this reason the 
												dismissal of the plaintiff is 
												void. See L'iar Liquid Ghana v. 
												Admin Supra. On the issue of 
												&quot;audi alterem partem&quot; rule, 
												namely: hear the other party, 
												the plaintiff complained that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												a) After the respondent bank 
												received the answer to his query 
												sent to him on 30th March 1994, 
												it was the duty of the 
												defendants to formulate the 
												relevant charges against him and 
												afford him adequate opportunity 
												to reply or to plead to them, 
												but this was not done.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												b) that also the plaintiff 
												should have been informed and 
												served with notice in advance of 
												the intended hearing of any 
												charges against him by 
												defendant. That if this had been 
												done then the plaintiff would 
												have been aware of the impending 
												disciplinary trial and may have 
												been aware of the impending 
												disciplinary trial and may have 
												under the requirements of Rule 4 
												(1) of the Ghana Commercial Bank 
												Ltd Staff Conduct and Discipline 
												Rules, applied or requested for 
												a personal hearing to the 
												Disciplinary Committee. Since 
												the plaintiff knew nothing about 
												any disciplinary charges being 
												tried by the Committee against 
												him he could have applied for a 
												personal hearing, to his 
												detriment. Plaintiff also did 
												not know the contents of the BNI 
												report which had been sent to 
												the defendant to enable him to 
												give any comment on it and he 
												did not receive any other report 
												either that of the Disciplinary 
												Committee of the Executive 
												Committee so he could not have 
												defended himself until he 
												received the letter of dismissal 
												dated 4th November 1994 from the 
												procedure being taken against 
												him.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												According to Rule 4(2) the 
												disciplinary committee should 
												have drafted its recommendation 
												to the Executive Committee in a 
												logical judgment like fashion by 
												giving cogent reasons for its 
												conclusions but there is no 
												indication that even this was 
												done, since no such reports and 
												recommendations were made 
												available for study by the 
												plaintiff.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Rule (4) 3 stipulates that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The executive committee should 
												carefully consider the 
												investigation report, the 
												employees defence statements, 
												the seasoned recommendations of 
												the Disciplinary Committee and 
												examine whether the facts have 
												been brought out in a fair and 
												impartial manner. Based on its 
												assessment, the executive 
												committee may arrive at its own 
												conclusions and may even differ 
												with the recommendations of the 
												Disciplinary Committee. It may 
												fix a reduced or enhanced 
												penalty or may approve of the 
												recommendations of the 
												Disciplinary Committee. In cases 
												where the penalty is enhanced, 
												the Executive Committee may do 
												so after granting a personal 
												hearing for the employee if no 
												such hearing was given by the 
												Disciplinary Committee&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">

												The appellant is above the grade

												committee is to be enhanced 
												neither but the executive 
												committee nor the Board complied 
												with the rule dealing with 
												enhancement of punishment. 
												Plaintiff was also not given a 
												personal hearing by the Board 
												which enhanced his penalty, to 
												that of dismissal from the Bank. 
												By parity of reasoning if the 
												Executive Committee is required 
												to give a personal hearing to an 
												accused officer who is subject 
												to its disciplinary authority 
												before enhancing his sentence, 
												then the Board which is also the 
												disciplinary authority of the 
												plaintiff should, by necessary 
												implications have also 
												personally heard him before 
												ordering his dismissal from the 
												Bank in compliance with Rule 
												4:3. The reason for this 
												requirement when it comes to 
												fixing the penalty or 
												punishment, is to enable an 
												accused and convicted official 
												to plead in mitigation of 
												sentence, where he was not been 
												given an opportunity to be 
												personally heard at the 
												Disciplinary Committee, where he 
												could have taken up that matter. 
												For failure to comply with Rule 
												4:3 the Board breached the rules 
												of fair play as well as its own 
												disciplinary procedure Rules and 
												condemned and enhanced the 
												punishment of the Plaintiff 
												without giving him a hearing 
												contrary to the &quot;audi alterem 
												Rule&quot;. As already stated above a 
												decision given without regard to 
												the principles of Natural 
												Justice is void. It is my 
												considered opinion that in this 
												case also failure to apply the 
												rules of natural justice and the 
												procedure rules of the Bank 
												renders the decision of the 
												Board and dismissal of plaintiff 
												void. In view of this opinion, I 
												find that the High Court was 
												justified in the decision that 
												there has been a breach of the 
												rules of natural justice and 
												that, consequently, the 
												plaintiffs dismissal was 
												unlawful. For the above reasons 
												I hold that the Court of Appeal 
												erred in reversing the High 
												Courts decisions. This finding I 
												believe was a result of wrong 
												application of the rules of fair 
												hearing and natural justice by 
												the majority of the court. An 
												example of some of the errors 
												committed is that in the opinion 
												of Mr. Justice Ofori-Boateng J. 
												A. &quot;because of the knowledge and 
												experience of Mr. Aboagye, he 
												need not be reminded of his 
												right&quot;. But the rules of fair 
												trial include the audi alteram 
												partem rule, which implies that 
												it is the authority exercising 
												disciplinary power ought to 
												afford the Plaintiff the 
												opportunity of being heard, he 
												should be informed of the 
												charges and date and place of 
												trial. It is only by so doing 
												that the plaintiff would have 
												been enabled to present his 
												defence. The face that he ought 
												to have known or be presumed to 
												know the rules, does not relieve 
												the bank from conforming with 
												the rules of a fair trial as 
												referred to in above. In any 
												case plaintiff cannot exercise 
												his right in Rule 4 (1) of the 
												rules, to ask for a personal 
												hearing. When he has not been 
												served with any charges or given 
												notice of hearing nor given the 
												opportunity to defend himself 
												against these charges except 
												when he is informed that a 
												disciplinary hearing was going 
												on. It is not right to merely 
												assume that the plaintiff should 
												have known his rights. 
												Plaintiffs' rights cannot be 
												wished away by a mere 
												presumption, and furthermore a 
												query is not the same as a 
												disciplinary charge or notice of 
												an on going disciplinary 
												proceedings. The two queries in 
												&quot;Exhibit E&quot; and &quot;Exhibit G&quot; 
												merely asked the plaintiff to 
												give reasons why he signed the 
												draft No. 177036 dated 17/7/92 
												for £15,000 and a cable 
												authorising payment of 
												US$13,559.60 on behalf of White 
												Chapel without ensuring that the 
												customers account were debited 
												and why internal entries were 
												not passed to the debit of 
												customers and to confirm whether 
												the signature on the two 
												transactions were that of the 
												plaintiff which he did. Surely 
												these queries cannot by any 
												stretch of imagination be 
												considered or likened to a 
												disciplinary charge or to 
												notice. Nor did the queries 
												refer to any disciplinary charge 
												against him. Another example is 
												the interpretation put on Rule 
												4(3) by Justice Ofori Boateng. 
												He said:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;However it is wrong noting that 
												in Rule 4(3) the duty on the 
												Executive Committee to give a 
												personal hearing to the victim 
												is not a mandatory one. It is 
												discretionary. The Executive 
												Committee may therefore, for its 
												own reasons enhance the 
												punishment without giving any 
												personal hearing. In this case 
												the Executive Committee enhanced 
												the respondents punishment 
												without giving him a personal 
												hearing. This behaviour by the 
												Executive Committee is within 
												the rules and not in violation 
												of them&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This interpretation was 
												erroneous since the 
												discretionary power of the 
												Executive committee or by 
												implication that of the Board to 
												enhance punishment can only be 
												exercised after giving a 
												personal hearing to the 
												plaintiff or employee under the 
												above quoted rule. Therefore it 
												is wrong for the said Learned 
												Judged to hold that the 
												behaviour of the Executive 
												committees is within the rules, 
												on the contrary it is a 
												violation of Rule 4(3) says:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;.........................</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In cases where the penalty is 
												enhanced the Executive Committee 
												may do so after granting a 
												personal hearing to the employee 
												if no such hearing was given him 
												by the Disciplinary Committee.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is a mandatory provision&#8212;a 
												prerequisite to the exercise of 
												the discretionary power to 
												enhance punishment. The same 
												refers to the Board. In Kauda v. 
												Government of Malaya (1962) AC 
												322 it was held in holding 2</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;that the failure to supply the 
												appellant with a copy of the 
												report of enquiry which 
												contained matter highly 
												prejudicial to him and which had 
												been sent to and read by the 
												adjudicating officer before he 
												sat to inquire into the charge 
												amount to a failure to afford 
												the appellant &quot;a reasonable 
												opportunity of being heard&quot; in 
												answer to the charge, within the 
												meaning of Article 135(2) of the 
												constitution and to a denial of 
												natural justice&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The dismissal of Kauda in the 
												above named circumstances was 
												therefore declared invalid as 
												made contrary to the rules of 
												natural justice. In the same 
												vein the failure to observe the 
												provisions of Article 23 
												regarding issue of a fair 
												hearing in the circumstances of 
												this case, nullified the verdict 
												of the Board of the defendant 
												bank in respect to the dismissal 
												of plaintiff.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Finally in considering the 
												question whether or not in any 
												particular case there has been a 
												failure of natural justice, the 
												fact that there was evidence to 
												support the charge preferred 
												against the plaintiff namely 
												Negligence, is immaterial to the 
												determination of the issue 
												whether the plaintiff had not 
												been given a fair trial. Lord 
												Denning the case of Annamunthodo 
												v. Oil Field Workers Union 
												(1961) AC 945 on this point 
												said,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Mr. Lazarus did suggest that a 
												man could not complain of 
												failure of natural justice 
												unless he could show that he had 
												been prejudiced by it. Their 
												Lordships cannot accept this 
												suggestion. If a domestic 
												tribunal fails to act in 
												accordance with natural justice, 
												the person affected by their 
												decision can always seek redress 
												in the courts. It is a prejudice 
												to any man to be denied justice. 
												He will not be entitled to 
												damages if he suffered none. But 
												he can always ask for the 
												decision against him to be set 
												aside.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I think that the Appellant has 
												succeeded in showing that he did 
												not receive a fair trial by the 
												Defendant Bank in respect of the 
												disciplinary proceedings held 
												against him and that his 
												conviction and the decision to 
												dismiss him for negligence is 
												null and void. The Court of 
												Appeal erred in reversing the 
												decision of the High Court. The 
												appeal of Appellant is allowed 
												and the decision of the trial 
												High Court wholly restored, 
												including the award of damages 
												granted to the Plaintiff by the 
												High Court.</span></p>

												ADJABENG, J.S.C.: </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I agree that the appeal be 
												allowed. After perusing the 
												record in this matter and 
												considering the submissions made 
												on both sides, and the 
												authorities cited, I am of the 
												view that the trial judge was 
												right in holding that the 
												dismissal of the appellant was 
												null and void as he had not been 
												given a hearing. Some of the 
												justices of the Court of Appeal 
												took the view that giving the 
												appellant a query amounted to 
												giving him a hearing. And they 
												relied on the Court of Appeal 
												case of Aryee Vrs. S.C.C. 
												[1984-863] 1 GLR 424, C.A. and 
												the case of the Republic Vrs.&nbsp; 
												Ghana Railway Corporation, Ex 
												Parte Appiah [1981] GLR 752. The 
												above two cases can be 
												distinguished from the present 
												one as the former concerned the 
												termination of an appointment in 
												accordance with the terms of the 
												contract between the parties 
												and, in the other case, the 
												applicants had earlier been 
												notified to appear before a 
												board of enquiry. Quite apart 
												form this, some of the judges of 
												the Court of Appeal, in the 
												present case, lost sight of the 
												fact that the appellant had a 
												right of a personal hearing 
												under Rule 4(1) of the Staff 
												Rules, Exhibit 'B'. Rule 4(1) of 
												Exhibit 'B' provides as 
												follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The Disciplinary Committee may 
												be vested with the authority to 
												offer a personal hearing to the 
												delinquent employee if such 
												hearing is requested for by the 
												employee, and the Committee by 
												majority opinion feels the need 
												for such hearing in order to 
												afford a fair opportunity to the 
												employee. The authority of the 
												Disciplinary Committee to offer 
												personal hearing is, however, 
												restricted to employees up to 
												the grade of Senior Managers. In 
												other cases, the employee's 
												request may be put up to the 
												Executive Committee for 
												consideration&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is clear from the above rule 
												of the defendant Bank that the 
												appellant was entitled not only 
												to a hearing, but a personal 
												hearing. Giving him a query 
												would not, by any stretch of the 
												imagination, be the same as 
												giving him a personal hearing. 
												The trial judge found that the 
												appellant was not notified of 
												the proceedings before the 
												Disciplinary Committee to enable 
												him decide whether or not to 
												request for a personal hearing. 
												To counter this, it has been 
												argued on behalf of the 
												defendant/respondent that with 
												his experience, and after his 
												receipt of the queries and the 
												letter of suspension, the 
												plaintiff/appellant knew or 
												ought to have known that 
												investigations were going on and 
												so he could have requested for a 
												personal hearing if he in fact 
												needed it. I am not impressed by 
												this argument. There is nothing 
												in the queries or in the 
												suspension letter which 
												suggested that there was going 
												to be proceedings before any 
												committee. In my view, it is the 
												duty of any adjudicating 
												authority to act fairly and with 
												transparency. Why should the 
												appellant's or any other 
												person's fate be decided in 
												secrecy? What is the point in 
												doing that? Our 1992 
												Constitution in Article 23 
												provides that:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Administrative bodies and 
												administrative officials shall 
												act fairly and reasonably and 
												comply with the requirements 
												imposed on them by law and 
												persons aggrieved by the 
												exercise of such acts and 
												decisions shall have the right 
												to seek redress before a Court 
												or other Tribunal.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I do not think that the 
												appellant was treated fairly in 
												this matter.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Another serious error the 
												defendant Bank committed against 
												the appellant was to order his 
												dismissal, contrary to the 
												recommendations of the 
												Disciplinary Committee and the 
												Executive Committee that the 
												appellant be warned and his 
												salary reduced, and thus an 
												enhancement of his penalty, 
												without giving him a personal 
												hearing. Rule 4(3) of the Staff 
												Rules, Exhibit 'B' provides as 
												follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;4(3) The Executive Committee 
												should carefully consider the 
												investigation report, the 
												employee's defence statements, 
												the reasoned recommendations of 
												the Disciplinary Committee and 
												examine whether the facts have 
												been brought out in fair and 
												impartial manner. Based on its 
												assessment, the Executive 
												Committee may arrive at its own 
												conclusions and may even differ 
												with the recommendations of the 
												Disciplinary Committee. It may 
												fix a reduced or enhanced 
												penalty or may approve of the 
												recommendations of the 
												Disciplinary Committee. In cases 
												where the penalty is enhanced, 
												the Executive Committee may do 
												so after granting a personal 
												hearing to the employee if no 
												such hearing was given by the 
												Disciplinary Committee.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(emphasis mine)</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The provision in the above rule 
												that the Executive Committee 
												should give a personal hearing 
												to an employee if the committee 
												wanted to enhance the penalty 
												recommended by the Disciplinary 
												Committee in case no such 
												hearing had been given to the 
												employee, is a commendable 
												provision. It seeks to give a 
												fair opportunity to the employee 
												who finds himself or herself in 
												such a situation. Having found 
												the necessity for such a 
												provision, it is my view that 
												the application of this 
												provision should not be 
												restricted to the Executive 
												Committee. It must apply to the 
												Board as well so as to ensure 
												that fairness that is necessary 
												in such matters. Unfortunately, 
												the Board failed to apply this 
												laudable provision to itself 
												when dismissing the appellant. 
												In my view, the Board of the 
												defendant Bank should have given 
												the appellant a personal hearing 
												when it decided to enhance the 
												penalty recommended by both the 
												Disciplinary and Executive 
												Committees. They were wrong in 
												not giving him this opportunity.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In my view, the Board was also 
												wrong in altering the finding of 
												the Disciplinary Committee which 
												first sat on the matter from 
												misconduct to gross misconduct. 
												It is difficult to find the 
												basis of this new and more 
												serious finding.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b)&nbsp; A declaration that the

												refund of his salary wrongfully 
												withheld.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(c)&nbsp; A declaration that the

												In his statement of claim the

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The judgment was against the

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Let me say at the onset that the 
												appellant's ground of appeal is 
												an apology for professional 
												expertise. It is the only 
												substantive ground of appeal 
												filed and I wish it were better 
												framed. The appellant is 
												appealing against the decision 
												of the Court of Appeal. The 
												Notice of Appeal says &quot;Take 
												Notice that the 
												Plaintiff/Respondent herein 
												being dissatisfied with the 
												judgment of the Court of Appeal 
												dated 26th November, 1998 doth 
												hereby appeal to the Supreme 
												Court upon the grounds set out 
												in paragraph 3 ...&quot; I cannot 
												imagine what reasons he has to 
												attack the Court of Appeal 
												judgment as being against the 
												rules of natural justice. The 
												attack is clearly misconceived 
												and misdirected. There is no 
												justification for it. It is 
												misdirected because counsel for 
												the appellant did not seem to 
												direct it at the Court of Appeal 
												Judgment but rather at the 
												defendant's act of dismissing 
												the appellant. I am of the 
												opinion that this portion of the 
												appellant's ground discloses no 
												reasonable ground of appeal 
												against the judgment of the 
												Court of Appeal. Nowhere in his 
												submission before this court has 
												counsel for the appellant shown 
												what the Court of Appeal did to 
												render its judgment against the 
												rules of natural justice. Every 
												submission made by counsel in 
												respect of the rules of natural 
												justice related to the steps 
												taken by Respondent in 
												dismissing the appellant. Rule 
												6(5) of the Supreme Court rules 
												gives the court power suo motu 
												to strike out any ground of 
												appeal which discloses no 
												reasonable ground of appeal. In 
												the exercise of that 
												prerogative, I would delete that 
												portion of the ground of appeal 
												which states that the judgment&nbsp; 
												is against natural justice. In 
												the result the ground will now 
												read as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The judgment was against the 
												weight of evidence adduced&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The court will therefore deal 
												with the appeal on the ground as 
												amended and try to draw the 
												right conclusions from the 
												evidence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The ground for the dismissal 
												alleged in the letter dismissing 
												the appellant was gross 
												misconduct. The letter reads: 
												&quot;The Board at its meeting held 
												on 27th October, 1994 noted the 
												extent of your involvement in 
												the malpractices at our Foreign 
												Operations Branch and decided 
												that you should be dismissed for 
												gross Misconduct&quot;. The 
												respondent bank accordingly 
												particularised the &quot;gross 
												misconduct&quot; into three acts 
												namely (1) signing a Draft for 
												£15,000.00 issued in favour of a 
												customer who did not have 
												sufficient funds in its account, 
												(2) signing a cable authorising 
												payment of the sum of 13,559.60 
												dollars on behalf of a customer 
												without ensuring that the 
												customer's account have been 
												duly debited and (3) Neglecting 
												to ensure that internal entries 
												in respect of the said two 
												transactions were passed to the 
												debit of the two customers' 
												accounts. The respondent insist 
												that the appellant was negligent 
												in the sense that he 
												countersigned the documents 
												without checking on the state of 
												the customers' accounts and 
												thereby aided the customers to 
												commit fraud on the bank.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												According to the defence, the 
												financial loss caused to the 
												bank was due to the default or 
												wilful act of the appellant. The 
												respondent also insist that 
												having regard to the 
												circumstances of the case, the 
												summary dismissal of the 
												appellant was just and proper, 
												more so because, according to 
												the respondent the appellant 
												himself admitted that he was 
												negligent. The appellant denies 
												that he acted negligently. His 
												case was that he counter-signed 
												the documents which originated 
												form outside his department 
												believing that the officers of 
												the originating department had 
												made and passed the proper 
												entries before signing the 
												cheque and telex message sent to 
												him to countersign. In his 
												petition against the dismissal 
												he re-affirmed his position as 
												follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Therefore an officer signing or 
												countersigning a cheque or telex 
												message especially outside his 
												department believes that the 
												entries have been passed. This 
												was the practice at that time. 
												There was the reciprocal trust 
												among the various departments. 
												All officials were, like Julius 
												Caeser's wife, expected to live 
												above reproach. We worked under 
												the legal maxim that he who 
												comes for equity must come with 
												clean hands. It was under this 
												set up that I appended my 
												signature to the two documents 
												in questions&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												When the transaction was 
												initially discovered, and the 
												appellant was given a query 
												requesting him to give reasons 
												why he signed the transactions 
												without ensuring that the 
												customers' account were debited, 
												he explained the circumstances 
												in which the documents were 
												brought to him for signature and 
												concluded that there was mutual 
												trust among the officer corps to 
												ensure the free flow of work. 
												&quot;If officers were to insist on 
												seeing entries before 
												countersigning cheques and 
												cables (a) work would slow down 
												and (b) there would be delays in 
												taking entries to the waste 
												department&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It must be observed that the 
												issue involved in the suit was 
												not as to the alleged misconduct 
												or negligence of the appellant; 
												the issue was whether or not, 
												misconduct or no misconduct, 
												negligence or no negligence, the 
												summary dismissal of the 
												appellant was proper or 
												wrongful. The appellant's 
												complaint was, inter alia, that 
												firstly the authority which 
												purported to dismiss him lacked 
												original jurisdiction to do so; 
												secondly, the dismissal was in 
												blatant violation of the 
												defendant's own Staff Rules and 
												the rules of natural justice 
												because of apparent bias and 
												because he was not given a 
												hearing. The defendant denied 
												that the dismissal was wrongful. 
												From the pleadings filed, the 
												central issue which emerged and 
												was set down in the Summons for 
												directions was issue (b) which 
												reads: &quot;Whether or not the 
												dismissal of the plaintiff was 
												carried out in accordance with 
												the staff rules and or natural 
												justice or both&quot;. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is clear, therefore, that we 
												are not dealing with negligence 
												but the course of conduct 
												embarked upon by the defendant 
												in dismissing the appellant. We 
												will, I think, fall into grave 
												error if we should give too much 
												attention and weight to the 
												alleged misconduct or negligence 
												levelled against the appellant 
												and forget what the real issue 
												is.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellant's case is as 
												follows: Before the dismissal he 
												was given a query on 25th March, 
												1994 which he answered on 30th 
												March, 1994. I have already 
												referred to the query and reply. 
												He was then suspended from the 
												service pending investigations. 
												This suspension letter was dated 
												31st March, 1994. The matter was 
												referred to the Bureau of 
												National Investigation to 
												investigate and on 20th April, 
												1994, the BNI collected a 
												statement from the appellant, 
												and other employees of the bank 
												who were involved in the 
												transactions. The BNI 
												investigations Report was 
												tendered as Exhibit K. 
												Thereafter the defendant caused 
												an investigation into the 
												disciplinary aspect of the case 
												without notifying the appellant. 
												The disciplinary investigation 
												was conducted by the 
												Disciplinary Committee 
												established under the Staff 
												Rules. Its report with the 
												recommendations in respect of 
												the appellant was tendered in 
												evidence as Exhibit M. It was 
												subsequently forwarded to the 
												Executive Committee of the 
												defendant. The Executive 
												committee studied the report and 
												reviewed the penalty recommended 
												by the Disciplinary Committee. 
												It is the case of the appellant 
												that he was not given any notice 
												about these proceedings before 
												the two bodies and that he was 
												not given any opportunity of 
												being heard. The Executive 
												Committee which under the Staff 
												Rules had not the power and 
												authority to discipline the 
												appellant, appeared to have sent 
												its revised recommendations to 
												the Board of Directors which 
												alone was competent to 
												discipline the appellant. The 
												Executive Committee's work is in 
												evidence as Exhibit N. The 
												appellant complains that the 
												Board of Directors also did not 
												give him notice that they were 
												going to review the case against 
												him. So therefore the appellant 
												has clearly demonstrated that he 
												was not aware of all the 
												processes taken by the defendant 
												in arriving at the decision to 
												dismiss him.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												But the respondent vigorously 
												and strenuously contended that 
												the audi alteram partem rule had 
												not been breached. In the view 
												of the respondent the appellant 
												was given all the chance of 
												being heard. In the first place 
												the appellant was given a query 
												which he answered, admitting his 
												negligence. Secondly, the 
												appellant had the right to ask 
												for a personal hearing when the 
												Disciplinary Committee was 
												carrying out its investigations 
												but the appellant did not take 
												advantage of that opportunity 
												and, therefore, having failed to 
												apply to be heard before the 
												Disciplinary Committee, the 
												appellant cannot be heard to 
												complain that he was not given a 
												hearing. The primary issue is, 
												therefore, this: Can the 
												appellant be right in his claim 
												that the audi alteram partem 
												rule was breached? To find the 
												answer, we may have to start by 
												looking at the Staff Rules which 
												govern all disciplinary 
												procedures.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Rules which are described as 
												&quot;Ghana Commercial Bank Ltd. 
												Staff&nbsp; Conduct and Disciplinary 
												Rules&quot; apply to permanent Staff 
												of the respondent Bank. Section 
												2.1.1 describing the scope of 
												these rules declare that they 
												&quot;cover general observance of 
												good conduct, discipline, 
												integrity, diligence, fidelity 
												etc&quot;. Their scope is without any 
												express limitation. But it is 
												clear that in the event of any 
												employee being found guilty of 
												any act of misconduct, he would 
												certainly be penalised. The 
												penalties vary according to the 
												facts and circumstances of each 
												particular case, as section 3.2 
												suggests:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The penalties for proven acts 
												of indiscipline/misconduct 
												extend over a wide range, from 
												'summary dismissal' to 
												'warning'. The nature and 
												quantum of penalty in each case 
												will be determined by the 
												competent authority after taking 
												various related factors into 
												consideration&quot;. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellant is a Senior 
												Manager and so according to the 
												rules the competent authority to 
												determine the penalty in his 
												case is the Board of Directors 
												as provided in Rule 6(3): &quot;The 
												Board will be Disciplinary 
												Authority in respect of 
												officials above the grade of 
												Assistant Manager. But all such 
												cases will be referred to the 
												Board through the Managing 
												Director&quot;. The rules are not 
												well coordinated and it does not 
												appear very clear whether every 
												alleged act of indiscipline or 
												misconduct must necessarily be 
												investigated first by the 
												Disciplinary Committee before 
												action is taken by the 
												Disciplinary authority. That 
												however, appears to be the 
												general procedure at the 
												respondent bank. The suspension 
												of the appellant was imposed 
												pending investigations. The BNI 
												investigated the criminal 
												aspect, and the Disciplinary 
												Committee investigated the 
												internal disciplinary aspect. 
												The Staff Rules defines the 
												procedure before the 
												Disciplinary Committee. Rules 
												4(1) provides:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The Disciplinary Committee may 
												be vested with the authority to 
												offer a personal hearing to the 
												delinquent employee if such 
												hearing is requested for by the 
												employee and the Committee by a 
												majority opinion feels the need 
												for such hearing in order to 
												afford a fair opportunity to the 
												employee. The authority of the 
												Disciplinary Committee to offer 
												personal hearing is, however, 
												restricted to employees up to 
												the grade of Senior Managers. In 
												other cases, the employees 
												request may be put up to the 
												executive Committee for 
												consideration&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The rule appreciates the need 
												for a fair hearing and many an 
												employee who is facing a case as 
												serious as that involving the 
												appellant may wish to clear his 
												name and maintain his integrity 
												and keep his employment. An 
												employee under investigation 
												can, however, request for a 
												personal hearing only when he is 
												informed that an investigation 
												is being undertaken by the 
												Disciplinary Committee. The 
												appellant's right to be heard 
												demanded that he be informed of 
												any charges against him. If the 
												appellant was not notified about 
												any proceedings before the 
												Disciplinary Committee, I do not 
												see how he could be condemned 
												for not requesting for a 
												personal hearing. His evidence 
												is clear and unchallenged that 
												he had no knowledge of the 
												disciplinary proceedings. This 
												is what he told the trial court 
												in his evidence-in-chief:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;I was wrongfully dismissed by 
												the defendants. No charge of 
												misconduct was preferred against 
												me. I did not appear before any 
												disciplinary committee before I 
												was dismissed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												When the respondent's 
												representative Mr. Joseph 
												Patrick Darku Wellington gave 
												evidence, he never showed that 
												the appellant was given notice 
												of the proceedings before the 
												Disciplinary Committee and under 
												cross-examination this gentleman 
												admitted that the appellant was 
												not given the opportunity of 
												being heard. He was asked, &quot;was 
												the plaintiff given an 
												opportunity of being heard&quot;, and 
												his answer was a definite &quot;No&quot;. 
												It stands to reason, upon the 
												evidence, to accept the 
												appellant's story that he had no 
												notice of the proceedings before 
												the Disciplinary Committee and 
												that was why he did not apply to 
												be given a personal hearing.
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Disciplinary Committee 
												investigation went on behind the 
												appellant; the committee's 
												recommendation was that the 
												appellant be warned and his 
												&quot;Salary reduced to the first 
												notch&quot; of his present scale. The 
												recommendation was forwarded to 
												the Executive Committee as 
												required by Rule 4(2) of the 
												Staff Rules. The Executive 
												Committee was mandated to </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;carefully consider the 
												investigation report, the 
												employees defence statements, 
												the reasoned recommendations of 
												the Disciplinary Committee and 
												examine whether the facts have 
												brought out in a fair and 
												impartial manner. Based on its 
												assessment, the Executive 
												Committee and may even differ 
												with the recommendations of the 
												Disciplinary Committee. It may 
												fix a reduced or enhanced 
												penalty or may approve of the 
												recommendations of the 
												Disciplinary Committee. In cases 
												where the penalty is enhanced, 
												the Executive Committee may do 
												so after granting a personal 
												hearing to the employee if no 
												such hearing was given by the 
												Disciplinary Committee&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is here important to note 
												that the Executive Committee is 
												empowered to examine the 
												proceedings before the 
												Disciplinary Committee and if it 
												thinks fit review any punishment 
												recommended by the Disciplinary 
												Committee. The review may take 
												the form of enhancing the 
												recommended penalty, subject to 
												this proviso that if the 
												Executive Committee intends to 
												increase the punishment, it can 
												do so only after granting the 
												appellant a personal hearing in 
												case no such hearing was given 
												him by the Disciplinary 
												Committee. The evidence, 
												however, shows that the 
												Executive Committee also 
												reviewed the findings of the 
												Disciplinary Committee and 
												enhanced the punishment without 
												giving the appellant a hearing. 
												While accepting that the 
												appellant should be warned, the 
												Executive Committee recommended 
												the reduction in grade by &quot;four 
												notches&quot; which amounts to an 
												enhancement of the Disciplinary 
												Committee's recommended penalty. 
												Before they could do that they 
												were mandatorily required to 
												give the appellant a personal 
												hearing. But again the appellant 
												had no notice about the review 
												exercise before the Executive 
												Committee. When the Executive 
												Committee, realised that it was 
												not within its powers to impose 
												disciplinary sanctions on the 
												appellant who is a senior 
												manager, the committee referred 
												its own recommendations to the 
												Board of Directors, being the 
												appropriate body, to pronounce 
												the penalty. The Board too did 
												not give the appellant any 
												notice or the chance to be 
												heard. I think the hearing 
												requested before increasing the 
												recommended penalty may not be 
												intended to open up the whole 
												inquiry but perhaps to afford&nbsp; 
												the employee the chance to show 
												cause why the penalty should not 
												be increased. The evidence is 
												unchallenged that no chance of a 
												hearing was given to the 
												appellant throughout the entire 
												spectrum of the process leading 
												to his dismissal. And I think 
												the learned judges of the Court 
												of Appeal with respect erred 
												when they said that since the 
												appellant did not request for a 
												personal hearing the loss of 
												that opportunity could not be 
												blamed on the Disciplinary 
												Committee. They overlooked the 
												circumstances under which the 
												appellant would have been 
												enabled to exercise that right. 
												When Justice Ofori-Boateng 
												quoted de Smith to the effect 
												that &quot;The courts have held that 
												the failure to give formal 
												opportunity to be heard is 
												immaterial if the person 
												affected was in fact aware of 
												what was proposed or knew or 
												ought to have known that he 
												could have made representations 
												had he wished&quot; he ought to have 
												immediately realised that the 
												statement scored a point in 
												favour of the appellant's case 
												because the evidence showed that 
												the appellant was not aware that 
												any investigation before the 
												Disciplinary Committee was 
												proposed and even carried out.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is also contended on behalf 
												of the respondent that the query 
												served on the appellant and his 
												reply thereto constituted 
												sufficient hearing. I do not 
												think this is acceptable. In my 
												opinion the two queries served 
												on the appellant did not form 
												part of the investigations. The 
												first query Exhibit &quot;E&quot; asked 
												him to give reasons why he 
												counter signed the documents. 
												That query was issued on 25th 
												March, 1994. The second query 
												dated 29th March, 1994 asked him 
												to confirm whether the signature 
												on the two documents was his. 
												These two queries certainly 
												preceded the BNI investigations 
												which were conducted between 
												April and June 1994. And the 
												investigation by the 
												Disciplinary Committee also was 
												done after the BNI 
												investigations. Indeed if the 
												queries and answers had 
												satisfied the respondent, no 
												further investigation would have 
												been called for. The queries 
												were precursors of the 
												investigations and did not seek 
												to probe the appellant's 
												involvement in the transactions. 
												I would hold that those queries 
												do not constitute the hearing 
												envisaged by the rules of 
												natural justice or the Staff 
												Rules. Some reliance was placed 
												on the decision in Aryee v. 
												State Construction Corporation 
												(1984-86)1 GLR 424 which was 
												decided by the Court of Appeal. 
												The Court of Appeal in its 
												judgment in that case delivered 
												by Adade JSC was quoted as 
												saying as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;But what is a &quot;hearing&quot; in this 
												context? Where a board writes to 
												an employee drawing his 
												attention to alleged acts of 
												misconduct and impropriety and 
												invites a written explanation, 
												we would think that the employee 
												would have been given an 
												opportunity to be heard. And if 
												the employee writes back 
												answering the queries and offers 
												explanations and justifications 
												for his conduct or otherwise 
												upon &quot;sober refection&quot; withdraws 
												the allegations and insinuations 
												and apologises for his conduct, 
												then surely he would have taken 
												advantage of the opportunity 
												offered and would have been 
												heard. The board would then be 
												entitled to take a decision on 
												the basis of the answers, 
												explanations, justifications or 
												apologies given by the employee&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Lamptey, J.A.. as he then was 
												and Mrs Wood relied on this 
												pronouncement by Adade JSC to 
												support their views that the 
												queries given the appellant in 
												the instant case were enough to 
												constitute a hearing. I think 
												that here too they were wrong. 
												Very few propositions of law are 
												of universal validity and 
												applicable in all circumstances. 
												In the greater number of cases 
												statements framed&nbsp; by certain 
												judges as general principles of 
												law are indeed not so. In the 
												Aryee case the court found that 
												Aryee was not dismissed; the 
												corporation merely terminated 
												their contract with him as they 
												were entitled to do and paid him 
												his three months salary in lieu 
												of notice. There was no 
												suggestion that the corporation 
												gave Aryee any query before 
												terminating the contract. What 
												happened was that on an earlier 
												occasion Aryee had done the very 
												thing and when he was 
												&quot;arraigned&quot; before the board of 
												directors he wrote a letter and 
												apologised after a &quot;sober 
												reflection&quot;. This was before the 
												offence for which the contract 
												was terminated. I think that the 
												statement of the learned Justice 
												in the Aryee case was 
												unfortunately too wide and 
												misleading. The contents of 
												every query and the answer 
												thereto will have to be examined 
												to see if they qualify to 
												satisfy the requirement of a 
												hearing.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What then is a &quot;hearing&quot; in&nbsp; the 
												context of the Staff Rules? In 
												trying to answer this question 
												it is pertinent to remind 
												ourselves that is not advisable 
												to follow and apply principles 
												and rules of law without a 
												careful examination of the 
												peculiar facts and special 
												circumstances which impinge on 
												the application of those rules 
												and principles. I concede that 
												some authorities indicate that a 
												hearing does not necessarily 
												involve the physical presence of 
												the employee, or a formal trial 
												akin to court proceedings see 
												Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol. 
												14th Edition paragraph 84; Rep. 
												V. Ghana Railway Corp. (1981) 
												GLR 752, at 758; Aryee v. State 
												Construction Corp. (1984-86)1 
												GLR 424 holding 2 at page 426; 
												But this statement is subject to 
												several qualifications that may 
												become necessary having regard 
												to each particular case. Thus 
												the learned authors in 
												Halsbury's Law of England in the 
												very paragraph 4 which I have 
												quoted above also had this to 
												say:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The standard of natural justice 
												and fairness are highly 
												flexible. Although the two 
												cardinal principles stated above 
												must normally though not 
												invariably be observed, the 
												precise procedure to be followed 
												in a given situation depends 
												upon the subject matter of the 
												decision or adjudication and 
												upon all the circumstances of 
												the case''.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It must not be lost on us that 
												the right to be heard, which we 
												also call the audi alteram 
												partem rule is an essential 
												characteristic of the principle 
												of natural justice. It 
												postulates that if any evidence 
												is taken against a man he must 
												be informed and allowed an 
												opportunity to correct or 
												contradict all adverse facts 
												given against him. Special 
												circumstance alone will defeat 
												this basic edict of the law. 
												Besides, the dismissal of the 
												appellant was carried out under 
												specific rules governing the 
												appellant and the respondent 
												bank. Those rules enjoin the 
												Disciplinary Committee and the 
												Executive Committee to give the 
												appellant a &quot;personal hearing&quot;. 
												The emphasis is on the word 
												&quot;personal&quot;. I am of the view 
												that &quot;personal hearing&quot; requires 
												the presence of the appellant 
												during the proceedings. But it 
												has been argued that the conduct 
												of the appellant viewed in the 
												context of the nature of the 
												business of banking constitutes 
												such a grave misconduct that it 
												was lawful to dismiss him even 
												without a hearing. The case of 
												Lever Bros. Ghana Ltd. v. Annan 
												(1989-'90)2 GLR 385; 
												Presbyterian church Agogo v. 
												Boateng (984-86)2 GLR 523; 
												Edward Nasser &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Abu 
												Jawdi (1965)2 GLR 523; 
												Halsbury's Law of England, 3rd 
												Edition at page 485, paragraph 
												938 were cited in support. The 
												principle relied on is this:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;A servant whose conduct is 
												incompatible with the faithful 
												discharge of his duty to his 
												master may be dismissed... 
												Dismissal is also justified in 
												the case of a servant... If his 
												conduct has been such that it 
												would be injurious to the 
												matter's business to retain 
												him&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I agree that this is the common 
												law position. Bowen L.J. had 
												expressed it in 1888 when he 
												said that it is right for the 
												employer to instantly dismiss 
												the employee if the latter's 
												conduct is not only wrongful and 
												inconsistent with his duty 
												towards his master but also 
												inconsistent with the 
												continuance of confidence 
												between them: Boston Deep Sea 
												Fishing &amp; Ice Co. v. Ansell 
												(1888) 39 Ch. 339, 363. A close 
												study of the authorities would, 
												however, reveal that the law has 
												not been static. Before the 
												close of the 19th century the 
												principle of audi alteram partem 
												did not appear to have any 
												general application to the case 
												of master and servant. But by 
												the second half of the 20th 
												century the traditional attitude 
												of the common law to the 
												employer's hitherto unrestrained 
												right to dismiss the servant was 
												experiencing a severe erosion, 
												with greater emphasis now being 
												placed on the need to give some 
												protection to the servant in a 
												bid to promote industry. The 
												tendency has been to discourage 
												summary dismissals which are, in 
												certain jurisdictions now termed 
												&quot;unfair dismissals&quot; (vide the 
												English Industrial Relations 
												Act, 1971 and the Trade Union 
												and Labour Relations Act, 1974) 
												The area of dismissals in the 
												common law of master and servant 
												is now largely superceded by 
												statutory provisions and express 
												employment contractual 
												agreements which bind the 
												parties. In the face of statute 
												law and contracts the common law 
												rules and authorities become 
												almost irrelevant, and the drift 
												has been quite so great that I 
												dare that say cases decided on 
												the principle of law relied on 
												by the Court of Appeal must be 
												considered as thoroughly 
												devitalised and no longer of any 
												controlling authority.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												My Lords, permit me to 
												illustrate the point I am 
												making. I will use three cases. 
												The first case is the case of 
												Sinclair v. Neighbour (1976) 2 
												WLR 1. It was decided by the 
												English court of Appeal. The 
												facts are simple. The plaintiff 
												was employed by the defendant as 
												the Manager of the betting shop. 
												He took £20 out of the till 
												without the knowledge of the 
												defendant because he knew that 
												if he had asked the defendant 
												the latter would not have 
												allowed him to take it. When the 
												defendant got to know what had 
												happened, he dismissed the 
												plaintiff summarily. The 
												plaintiff sued for wrongful 
												dismissal. The trial judge 
												upheld the claim for wrongful 
												dismissal and the defendant 
												appealed. The Court of Appeal 
												allowed the appeal holding that 
												the conduct of the plaintiff was 
												of such a grave and weighty 
												character as to undermine the 
												relationship of confidence which 
												should exist between master and 
												servant, and therefore the 
												summary dismissal of the 
												plaintiff was justified. The

												The second case is Earl v. 
												Slater &amp; Wheeler (Airlyne) Ltd. 
												(1973) All ER 145. It was 
												decided under the Industrial 
												Relations Act, 1971, by the 
												National Industrial Relations 
												Court. The plaintiff was an 
												employee of the defendant 
												company. While he was absent 
												from work due to sickness the 
												defendants (his employers) made 
												certain discoveries which showed 
												that the plaintiff was not 
												carrying out his duties 
												satisfactorily. On his return to 
												work the defendants dismissed 
												him summarily without giving him 
												any opportunity to state his 
												case even though the letter of 
												dismissal stated the reasons for 
												the dismissal. An industrial 
												tribunal dismissed the claim for 
												unfair dismissal and the 
												plaintiff appealed. The 
												appellate court allowed the 
												appeal holding that the 
												employers at the time of the 
												dismissal had not given the 
												plaintiff an opportunity to 
												explain the allegations made 
												against him contrary to section 
												24(6) of the Industrial 
												Relations Act.</span></p>

												The third case I have chosen 
												because it somewhat explains why 
												the difference in the two other 
												cases. This third case is E. 
												Devis and Sons Ltd. v. Aikins 
												(1976)1 WLR 393. The Respondent 
												was the manager of an abattoir. 
												The appellants were his 
												employers. The Respondent was 
												not taking instructions and the 
												appellants dismissed him and 
												offered him compensation for 
												loss of office. Subsequently, 
												however, the appellants withdrew 
												the offer of compensation and 
												claimed that they had a right to 
												dismiss him summarily on grounds 
												of gross misconduct during his 
												term of employment, even though 
												the alleged misconduct was not 
												discovered before his dismissal. 
												The Respondent made a complaint 
												of unfair dismissal to the 
												industrial tribunal, and the 
												tribunal ruled that in 
												determining whether or not the 
												dismissal was unfair under the 
												Trade Union and Labour Relations 
												Act, 1974, it was not prepared 
												to admit evidence of facts 
												within the knowledge of the 
												appellants at the time of the 
												dismissal; and it found that the 
												Respondent was unfairly 
												dismissed. The appellants, his 
												employers, appealed. The appeal 
												was dismissed. The court held 
												that on a complaint of unfair 
												dismissal under the 1974 Act, 
												the tribunal was not concerned 
												with the contractual 
												relationship at common law 
												between employer and employee 
												but only with the bare fact of 
												the dismissal; and that under 
												the Act the employer was under a 
												duty to satisfy the tribunal 
												that he acted reasonably in 
												dismissing the employee, in 
												which case the tribunal had to 
												confide itself to such facts as 
												were within the knowledge of the 
												employer at the time he 
												formulated his reasons for 
												dismissing the employee. The 
												court relied on Earl v. Slater &amp; 
												Wheeler (Airlyne) Ltd, supra and 
												distinguished Deep Sea Fishing &amp; 
												Ice Co. v. Ansell, supra.</span></p>

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Mr. Bresler, in his argument, 
												relies strongly on the common 
												law in relation to contracts of 
												employment and cites Cyril 
												Leonard &amp; Co. Vrs. Simo 
												Securities Trust Ltd. (1972) 1 
												WLR, 80 ....That seems to me on 
												the merits to be a very 
												persuasive argument. The 
												difficulty lies partly in the 
												language of paragraph 6(8) of 
												schedule 1 to&nbsp; the Act of 1974, 
												and partly in the decided 
												cases.&quot;</span></p>

												He continued at page 399:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Naturally, in developing his 
												submissions, Mr. Bresler has 
												pressed me strongly with the 
												cases of Boston Deep Sea Fishing 
												and Ice Co. vrs. Ansell (1888) 
												39 Ch.D. 3390 and Cyril Leonard 
												&amp; Co. vrs. Simo Securities Trust 
												Ltd. (1972) 1 WLR 80. But, quite 
												apart from the two cases under 
												the Industrial Relations Act, 
												1971 which I cited, it has to be 
												borne in mind, I think, that 
												there is a considerable 
												difference between the position 
												at common law and the position 
												under the Industrial Relations 
												Act 1971 and, now the Trade 
												Union and Labour Relations Act 
												1974. The common law is 
												concerned merely with the 
												contractual relationship between 
												the parties, whereas a complaint 
												of unfair dismissal under the 
												Act of 1974 is concerned with 
												the statutory right of an 
												employee not to be unfairly 
												dismissed.&quot;</span></p>

												We have the Ghana decided cases 
												following the modern pattern 
												that the employer-employee 
												relationship, where there are 
												agreed service conditions, must 
												be governed by those conditions. 
												In the University of Ghana v. 
												Mensah (1984-86) 2 GLR, 622 
												where the termination of the 
												employee's services were held to 
												be wrongful, the learned High 
												Court Judge correctly, in my 
												view, said: &quot;The action in this 
												case is that of master and 
												servant. In this case where the 
												relationship of the parties is 
												governed by the United 
												Conditions of Service for Senior 
												Staff of the University of 
												Ghana, Exhibit 1, effect should 
												be given to it&quot;. See also the 
												cases of Presbyterian Hospital, 
												Agogo v. Boateng (1984-86)2 GLR 
												381 Akorful v. State Fishing 
												Corp. (1991)2 GLR 348; Turkson

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In my opinion the common law 
												approach advertised by the Court 
												of Appeal is inapplicable in 
												this case; the appellant's 
												letter of appointment, exhibit 
												&quot;A&quot;, told the appellant &quot;You are 
												required to agree to be governed 
												by the Staff Rules...&quot; The 
												pleadings and the evidence show 
												that both parties recognise the 
												Staff Rules as governing their 
												relationship. The appellant's 
												claim is that the procedure 
												adopted in summarily dismissing 
												him is &quot;ultra vires&quot; those rules 
												and therefore wrongful. The 
												respondents maintain that they 
												acted within the parameters of 
												the rules. It is wrong to resort 
												to the common law right of the 
												employer to summarily dismiss 
												the employee for gross 
												misconduct. I think it is only 
												fair and right that the parties 
												should be held strictly to the 
												case made out by them in their 
												pleadings, and that the 
												respondent should not be allowed 
												to shift its ground. I do not 
												agree with the applicant that 
												the Board has no authority to 
												dismiss him. Under the Rules it 
												is the Board which is the 
												Disciplinary authority in cases 
												involving Senior Managers and 
												other employees above that rank.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												But the evidence is clear that 
												the respondent did not observe 
												the Staff Rules in dismissing 
												the appellant. The Disciplinary 
												Committee did not give the 
												appellant the opportunity to be 
												heard as required by Rule 4(1). 
												The Executive Committee also 
												failed to give the appellant a 
												hearing even though mandated to 
												do so by Rule 4(3). The Board, 
												in dismissing the appellant were 
												enhancing the penalty 
												recommended by both the 
												Disciplinary Committee and the 
												Executive Committee. The&nbsp; 
												Executive Committee and the 
												Board are the two disciplinary 
												authorities. The Executive 
												Committee in deciding to 
												increase any penalty&nbsp; 
												recommended by the Disciplinary 
												Committee in a case involving an 
												employee below the rank of 
												Senior Manager must give that 
												employee a personal hearing; and 
												I think that the Board, acting 
												similarly in respect of 
												employees of Senior Manager rank 
												and above in place of the 
												Executive Committee must equally 
												be bound to give such a personal 
												hearing to the employee.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellant's claim that he 
												was denied the opportunity to be 
												heard was made out and the Court 
												of Appeal was wrong in reversing 
												the judgment of the trial High 
												Court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the result, I agree that the
