												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Isaac Ottie alias Agya Atta died 
												on 10th August, 1982. He hailed 
												from Kenkase, Kwabre No. 3 in 
												Ashanti. He left behind a Will 
												dated 26th January, 1982. In the 
												Will he devised houses and farms 
												to his wife, children and other 
												persons. Among the devisees was 
												one Kwadwo Kwako, the appellant 
												herein. The testator in clause 7 
												of will devised six rooms in 
												House No. 54 Block 12 to the 
												appellant. Then in clause 13 of 
												the will the testator declared 
												that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Kwadwo Kwako is to inherit me 
												on my death and all the 
												properties which I have not 
												devised must go to him&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Plaintiff/Respondent 
												hereinafter referred to simply 
												as the respondent did not 
												receive any gift under the will. 
												On 7th February, 1991 the 
												respondent describing himself as 
												&quot;one of the principal members of 
												the Bretuo Family or clan of 
												Kenkase-Ashanti and a 
												beneficiary under the late Isaac 
												Ottie's said Will and who claims 
												to be interested in the 
												Residuary Estate of the said 
												Isaac Ottie&quot; (deceased) took out 
												an originating summons at the 
												High Court in Kumasi asking for 
												an interpretation of clause 13 
												of the Will, quoted above. In 
												his opinion the devise to the 
												appellant in clause 13 of the 
												Will was made to him in his 
												capacity as customary successor 
												and therefore the appellant must 
												be deemed to take such 
												properties in trust for his 
												immediate family. The question 
												he posed for determination as 
												follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Whether or not having regard to 
												the devises in the last will of 
												Isaac Ottie, alias Agya Atta 
												(decd) dated 26th January, 1982, 
												more particularly the devises 
												made in clauses 7 and 13 of the 
												said Will the late Testator 
												Isaac Ottie by clause 13 of the 
												said will devised his Residual 
												Estate to Kwadwo Kwako 
												personally forever or the devise 
												was made to Kwadwo Kwako in his 
												capacity as the customary 
												successor who is to hold the 
												properties in trust for his 
												immediate family&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The respondent contended that 
												the deceased made the devise in 
												clause 13 to the appellant in 
												his capacity as the deceased's 
												customary successor because the 
												deceased knew that the appellant 
												would be his customary 
												successor. The Respondent 
												alleged that before the deceased 
												died he pleaded with the elders 
												of the Bretuo family that he 
												wished the appellant to be his 
												customary successor and when the 
												family discovered later on that 
												this wish was &quot;repeated in the 
												last Will of the deceased&quot; the 
												family honoured it and 
												accordingly appointed the 
												appellant as the testator's 
												customary successor. The 
												appellant denied this. In an 
												affidavit filed on 4th March, 
												1991 in answer to the 
												respondent's claims, the 
												appellant deposed in paragraphs 
												6 and 7 as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(6) I deny that my late uncle 
												Isaac Ottie before his death 
												pleaded with the elders of the 
												Bretuo family that he wished 
												that I be made customary 
												successor any time he died.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(7) That my appointment as the 
												customary successor was not due 
												to any request of my late uncle 
												but by concensus of the family 
												after my late uncle's death&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Accordingly the appellant 
												maintained that any properties 
												covered under the devise made in 
												clause 13 were gifted to him 
												personally for his own benefit.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It would appear that the 
												confusion which arose in the 
												minds of the respondent and some 
												members of the Bretuo family was 
												created by the word &quot;inherit&quot; in 
												the controversial clause 13. 
												What did the testator mean when 
												he said &quot;Kwadwo Kwako is to 
												inherit me&quot;?.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">&nbsp;</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In his search for a proper 
												construction of clause 13, the 
												trial court decided to, and did 
												indeed, call the lawyer who 
												prepared the Will, in his own 
												words &quot;to tell this court what 
												his instructions were in respect 
												of clause 13&quot;. The lawyer's 
												evidence was briefly this:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;My instructions were that 
												Kwadwo Kwako who was to inherit 
												him was to take his residuary 
												estate on condition that he 
												would take care of his wife. The 
												residuary estate was to go to 
												the family if he failed to look 
												after his wife. The wife of 
												Ottie died not long afterwards&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Upon this evidence the trial 
												High Court judge made the 
												following observations in his 
												judgment:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Having heard counsel for both 
												sides, the court decided to fall 
												on the person who prepared the 
												Will to find out what the intent 
												of the testator was when he 
												(Testator) gave him 
												instructions. Fortunately, the 
												Will was prepared by a lawyer 
												who was readily available . . . 
												. . . . . . . .</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												From the evidence of the Lawyer, 
												Mr. Charles Kessie, it became 
												clear that the Testator intended 
												that the Residuary estate must 
												go to Kwadwo Kwako in his 
												personal capacity.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The condition upon which the 
												family was to have the Residuary 
												estate did therefore not 
												materialise.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Consequently, I hold that the 
												devise in clause 13 of the will 
												was to Kwadwo Kwako personally 
												and he took the same in his 
												personal capacity&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The respondent immediately 
												appealed to the Court of Appeal 
												on grounds that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) The judgment cannot be 
												supported having regard to the 
												contents of the Deceased's Will.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) The trial judge erred in law 
												by receiving extrinsic evidence 
												and using the same to ground her 
												judgment.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												When the appeal came up for 
												hearing the respondent argued 
												one additional ground which was 
												that &quot;(1) the interpretation 
												given by the learned High Court 
												Judge sins against the spirit 
												and letter of the section 1 of 
												the Wills Act, 1971. Act 360&quot;. 
												Counsel argued that by clause 13 
												the Testator clearly showed an 
												intention to appoint the 
												appellant as his customary 
												successor, and that the 
												residuary estate was to go to 
												the appellant in his capacity as 
												customary successor &quot;because the 
												testator gave all his properties 
												to children, wives etc.; and if 
												the appellant had not become 
												customary successor it would not 
												be proper for the residuary 
												estate to go to him as stated in 
												the Will&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Two of the three judges of the 
												Court of Appeal allowed the 
												appeal and one disagreed, 
												saying, &quot;There is nothing in the 
												Will of Ottie, which indicates 
												that Kwadwo Kwako was to take 
												the residuary estate other than 
												in his own personal capacity&quot;. 
												The majority decision was based 
												on the argument that the 
												deceased testator had, during 
												his life time, requested that 
												the appellant should be his 
												customary successor and because 
												the family acceded and appointed 
												him as such successor the 
												appellant was &quot;bound in law and 
												custom to hold and administer 
												the estate in trust for the 
												family and nothing more&quot;. They 
												made an order directing the 
												appellant to take the residuary 
												estate in trust for the family, 
												and &quot;to administer and manage it 
												for and on behalf of the 
												family&quot;. This is why the 
												appellant has also appealed to 
												this court. His grounds of 
												appeal are:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												1.&nbsp; That the judgment of the 
												Court of Appeal is wrong in law.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2. That the majority decision 
												that the 3rd 
												defendant/respondent/appellant 
												took those properties as 
												customary successor is wrong in 
												law.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3. That the majority of two 
												judges who decided that there 
												was ambiguity in paragraph 13 of 
												the Will of the testator have 
												erred in law.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												We are to settle finally what 
												should be the proper 
												construction of clause 13 of the 
												will. My Lords, I agree with the 
												learned judges of the Court of 
												Appeal that the trial judge 
												erred in taking evidence from 
												the lawyer who prepared the 
												Will.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												My understanding is that a Will 
												is a very special and solemn 
												legal document in which a person 
												declares his wishes as to how 
												his property should be 
												distributed, disposed of or 
												managed after his death; and the 
												greatest respect due to a 
												deceased person is, in my 
												opinion, to give effect to his 
												&quot;last Will and testament&quot; unless 
												there are compelling reasons 
												militating against doing so. 
												Annan J, as he then was, hit the 
												mark when he said that &quot; policy 
												of the court is to give effect 
												to the last wishes of the 
												deceased and to uphold them 
												unless there are overriding 
												legal obstacles in the way&#8221; &#8211;

												Mensah (1978) 1 GLR 226. In 
												accordance with this basic 
												principle, when the courts set 
												out to construe a Will what they 
												do is to look for the intention 
												of the testator as expressed by 
												him in the actual words used by 
												him, having regard to all the 
												other provisions in the will. 
												The intention which the will 
												itself declares either expressly 
												or by necessary implication is 
												what the courts would act upon. 
												The rule which enjoins the 
												courts to rely on the language 
												of the testator is normally 
												called the golden rule. There 
												are other rules, indeed many 
												rules, of construction which the 
												courts often rely on for 
												guidance. These several rules 
												have a common aim namely, to 
												direct the court towards an 
												objective standard of 
												construction and to exclude 
												evidence which seeks to provide 
												what is supposed to be the 
												actual intention of the 
												testator.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The rule is generally stated as 
												being this, that extrinsic 
												evidence of a testator's 
												declarations of intention as to 
												the meaning to be put on the 
												language used in his will is not 
												admissible as direct evidence of 
												his testamentary intention. 
												Under this rule evidence of 
												instructions given by the 
												testator for his Will and of any 
												declarations made by him as to 
												what he intended to do by the 
												Will is not admissible as direct 
												evidence of his testamentary 
												intention. Thus in the case of 
												Doe D. Hiscocks v. Hiscocks 
												(1839) 5 M &amp; W 363 it was held 
												that evidence of the testator's 
												instructions for his Will and of 
												his declarations after its 
												execution which suggested that 
												he meant the gift for &quot;Simon&quot; 
												and not &quot;John&quot; was not 
												admissible. But instructions 
												given for the Will are 
												admissible in two situations 
												accepted as exceptions to the 
												general rule. Such instructions 
												may be admissible in cases of 
												equivocation, and as 
												circumstantial evidence under 
												the arm-chair principle. An 
												equivocation, sometimes also 
												called a latent ambiguity, 
												arises if the name or 
												description of the devisee or 
												the property mentioned in the 
												will turns out to fit two or 
												more persons or things and 
												applies unambiguously to all of 
												them; and under the arm-chair 
												principle the instructions are 
												admissible as contemporaneous 
												evidence that is explanatory of 
												the meaning which the testator 
												attributed to a word or a name. 
												In either case the instructions 
												are not admitted for the purpose 
												of gathering what the testator 
												intended to do, but strictly for 
												the purpose of identifying the 
												person or object he is 
												reasonably deemed to have had in 
												mind. The point is illustrated 
												in In re Ofner: Samuel v. Ofner 
												(1909) 1 Ch. 60. In that case 
												the testator appointed one Dr. 
												Alfred Ofner as one of his 
												executors and gave him a legacy 
												of 2001. Among other legacies he 
												also gave &quot;to my grandnephew 
												Robert Ofner&quot; 1001&quot;. The Court 
												of Appeal held that a document 
												was admissible, not as evidence 
												of intention, but as evidence to 
												assist the court to find out who 
												the &quot;grandnephew&quot; was whom the 
												testator had wrongfully 
												described as &quot;Robert&quot;. With the 
												aid of the document the court 
												was able to conclude that it was 
												&quot;Richard&quot; who was mistakenly 
												referred to as &quot;Robert&quot; because 
												there was no &quot;Robert&quot; and Dr 
												Alfred Ofner indeed had a 
												brother called Richard whom the 
												testator was certainly referring 
												to, but erroneously thought he 
												was called Robert. As Farwell 
												L.J. put it in his judgment &quot;... 
												any evidence is admissible 
												which, in its nature and effect, 
												simply explains what the 
												testator has written, and no 
												evidence can be admissible for 
												the purpose of showing what he 
												really intended&quot;. In the instant 
												case the provision in clause 13 
												does not require any extrinsic 
												evidence to assist the court in 
												construing it. The language of 
												clause 13 is fairly 
												straightforward and portrays no 
												hidden intentions.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Looking at the grounds of appeal 
												filed by the appellant, it is my 
												view that they all centre on 
												only one and the same theme, 
												namely, that the majority 
												decision that the appellant 
												herein should take properties 
												under clause 13 as customary 
												successor is wrong. What the 
												majority are saying is that if 
												any properties come to the 
												appellant under clause 13, they 
												belong to the testator's 
												immediate family and the 
												appellant will hold them as a 
												trustee or caretaker for and on 
												behalf of the said family.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The problem with clause 13 is 
												caused by the verb &quot;inherit&quot;. 
												What is the import of the verb 
												&quot;inherit&quot; in the context of this 
												Will? The testator was a 
												Ghanaian and an Ashanti. But 
												this Will was prepared by a 
												lawyer who must be deemed to 
												have chosen his words with 
												professional insight. The words 
												he chose upon his instructions 
												are &quot;to inherit me&quot;; he did not 
												say &quot;to be my customary 
												successor&quot;. There must be reason 
												for this. To &quot;inherit&quot;, when 
												used in relation to succession 
												to property has as its primary 
												meaning the signification of 
												taking over the property of the 
												deceased owner. Its import is 
												that the inheritor is to acquire 
												the right and privilege to enjoy 
												any interest which the deceased 
												owner had in the property. This 
												meaning does not attach to the 
												position of a customary 
												successor in the customary law 
												system of inheritance. Whenever 
												the self-acquired property of a 
												deceased intestate is said to 
												become family property it is the 
												immediate family of the deceased 
												which takes the property. 
												Kwabena Bentsi-Enchill calls 
												that family the &quot;inheriting 
												group&quot;: See Ghana Land Law: page 
												158. Ollenu puts it this way:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;it cannot be overemphasized 
												that it is the family and not an 
												individual who inherits and 
												becomes owner of the 
												self-acquired property of a 
												deceased member of the family&quot;. 
												Vide, the law of Testater and 
												Intestate Succession in Ghana, 
												page 229.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What this means is that the 
												family acquires title of 
												ownership to the property. But 
												the family as owner always, and 
												invariably, appointed a member 
												of the family called the 
												&quot;successor&quot; to administer the 
												property for and on behalf of 
												the family. This successor, 
												stricto sensu, does not have 
												title. He is variously described 
												as a trustee or caretaker of the 
												family with powers to control 
												and manage the property.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												See Ahorklui v. Ahorklui: 
												reported in Ollenu, P.C.L.L.G. 
												page 212; Khoury &amp; Ors. v. 
												Tamakloe (1950) DC. (Land) 
												1948-51. The successor at 
												customary law is not necessarily 
												linked up with the property of 
												the deceased. A person may die a 
												pauper and still have a 
												successor. This is because the 
												rationale behind the concept of 
												customary successor transcends 
												the administration of the 
												deceased's property. SKB Asante, 
												in his learned treatise on 
												property law in this country 
												observed that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Aside from his powers and 
												obligations in respect of the 
												deceased's estate, a successor 
												represents the person of his 
												predecessor in a very real 
												sense; indeed he may be 
												described as the extension of 
												the decedent's legal persona. 
												Thus the decedent's children 
												become the children of the 
												successor; so does the 
												predecessor's wife, in the 
												technical sense at least. A 
												successor may cohabit with the 
												predecessor's wife if the wife 
												so desires, but in any case, he 
												is under an obligation to 
												maintain and support her while 
												she remains unmarried. Where his 
												means permit, a successor is 
												expected to honour the personal 
												and moral commitments of his 
												predecessor&quot; vide: Property Law 
												and social goals in Ghana 1844 - 
												1966, by S.K.B. Asante, pages 
												156 - 157.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The legal position therefore is 
												that a customary successor is 
												appointed even if there is no 
												property left behind by the 
												deceased intestate. The 
												corollary of this is that a 
												customary successor will not 
												administer and manage any 
												property on behalf of the family 
												if the deceased does not leave 
												behind any property for his 
												immediate family. It follows 
												therefore that if even we accept 
												the view that the testator in 
												this case did recommend the 
												appellant as his successor and 
												the family obliged after his 
												death, it does not follow as a 
												matter of course that the 
												appellant was intended to take 
												under clause 13 as a trustee or 
												caretaker of the family unless 
												it is evident that the testator 
												intended to give property under 
												the said clause 13 to the 
												family.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Until the Wills Act, 1971 (Act 
												360) came into force on the 1st 
												day of June, 1971, the making of 
												statutory Wills in this country 
												was governed by the English 
												Wills Act of 1837 which was part 
												of the common law of Ghana as a 
												statute of general application. 
												It did not impose any limitation 
												on testamentary freedom. The 
												tradition has not been changed 
												by Act 360. A testator can 
												therefore dispose of all his 
												property to whomsoever he 
												chooses. The only restriction 
												imposed by Act 360 is the 
												provision in section 13 of the 
												Act which gives certain 
												dependents of the deceased - 
												parents, spouse, child under 18 
												years - to claim a &quot;reasonable 
												provision&quot; for their needs out 
												of the estate of the deceased, 
												if the testator did not make 
												provision for them during his 
												lifetime or by the Will, and in 
												the opinion of the High Court 
												they are likely to suffer 
												hardship.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Indeed, there is no obligation 
												on the testator to leave 
												anything for his family. That is 
												the view I hold, looking at the 
												Wills Act (Act 360) and having 
												regard to the established right 
												of testamentary freedom which a 
												testator has; and if a testator 
												shows by his Will that the 
												family which under normal 
												circumstances would have had a 
												claim on his intestacy shall not 
												take under the Will, we must 
												give effect to his wish. We are 
												not entitled to indulge in any 
												wishful presumption that a 
												particular person or group of 
												persons is intended to be 
												provided for. The only guide is 
												the language of the Will. See 
												Turker v. Harrison (1832) 5 Sim 
												538 at page 543 where the court 
												said that there is no 
												presumption that anyone is to be 
												beneficiary except those named 
												or described in the Will as 
												such. In the instant case the 
												deceased's family is nowhere 
												mentioned in the Will, but the 
												Court of Appeal in the majority 
												judgment reasoned that because 
												the deceased suggested before 
												his death that the appellant 
												should be his customary 
												successor, and because the 
												family appointed the appellant 
												as the customary successor, 
												clause 13 which says that the 
												appellant should &quot;inherit&quot; him 
												must be construed to mean that 
												any devise to the appellant 
												under the said clause 13 must go 
												to the appellant in the 
												fiduciary capacity as caretaker 
												of the family. I have already 
												tried to show the distinction 
												between the &quot;inheritor&quot; and the 
												&quot;successor&quot; at customary law. 
												The argument by the two judges 
												of the Court of Appeal that the 
												deceased nominated the appellant 
												as his customary successor and 
												so the devise in clause 13 of 
												the Will cannot be said to be 
												specifically made to him does 
												not appear to me acceptable. In 
												the first place, the affidavit 
												evidence before the court does 
												not establish the claim that the 
												testator asked that the 
												appellant be made his successor. 
												The appellant denied that 
												allegation. The principal 
												members of the Bretuo family, in 
												what purports to be their Power 
												of Attorney to the Respondent 
												did not mention any request by 
												the testator that the appellant 
												be made his customary successor. 
												What they declared in the said 
												Power of Attorney is this: &quot;We 
												belong to the immediate family 
												of Isaac Ottie alias Agya Atta 
												(decd). Agya Atta died testate 
												having made a Will dated 
												26/l/82. When Agya Atta died our 
												family met and appointed our 
												relative Kwadwo Kwako to inherit 
												the deceased according to 
												customary law&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This declaration is not the same 
												as the deposition made by the 
												respondent in his affidavit 
												supporting his summons. What he 
												deposed to in paragraphs 6 and 7 
												of the affidavit is this:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;6. Before his death the late 
												Isaac Ottie pleaded orally with 
												the elders of our Bretuo family 
												at Kenkase-Ashanti that he 
												wished Kwadwo Kwako would be 
												made his customary successor any 
												time he died. This 'WISH' the 
												family later discovered had been 
												repeated in the last will of the 
												deceased.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												7. Thus at a family gathering 
												the family honoured the wishes 
												of the deceased Isaac Ottie and 
												appointed Kwadwo Kwako as the 
												customary successor of the late 
												Isaac Ottie&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The discrepancy in the 
												statements of the Principal 
												members of the family and the 
												respondent is glaring and leaves 
												considerable doubt on the 
												allegation that the deceased 
												wanted appellant to be his 
												customary successor; the doubt 
												is deepened in the face of the 
												denial made by the appellant. 
												Accordingly there was no 
												evidence before the trial court 
												that the deceased wanted the 
												appellant to be his customary 
												successor. That is not the same 
												as saying, as the majority of 
												the Court of Appeal would have 
												it, that the testator could not 
												appoint his customary successor 
												by his wWll. I concede that a 
												person cannot, as a general rule 
												of customary law, appoint his 
												own successor. The authorities 
												are many including Kwobah v. 
												Propaganda. Fide (1948) D.C. 
												Land (1948-51) 22; Frimpong v. 
												Anane (1965) GLR 354. And see 
												also Ollenu: The Law of Testate 
												and Intestate Succession in 
												Ghana (1966) page 95. Ollenu 
												explained that the rule applied 
												because the property would 
												become family property only 
												after the death of the member of 
												family and because upon his 
												death he would no longer have 
												any control over the land, it is 
												only reasonable that the family 
												as owner should be the right 
												authority to appoint the person 
												who should administer the estate 
												on its behalf. This means that 
												the customary law regarded any 
												attempt by the owner of property 
												to appoint his own customary 
												successor during his life time 
												as an encroachment upon the 
												rights of the family to appoint 
												a successor who is the family's 
												caretaker and owes a fiduciary 
												duty to the family. If the rule 
												is so understood then it appears 
												to me that it cannot be extended 
												to the case where the owner of 
												self-acquired property makes a 
												Will. The customary law rule 
												applies by operation of the 
												customary law upon intestacy. A 
												Will is intended to avoid 
												intestacy and the automatic 
												operation of the rules of the 
												customary law. And I think that 
												where the owner of property 
												makes a Will his freedom of 
												testamentary disposition must be 
												totally divorced from the 
												customary law, especially in a 
												situation where he does not give 
												any property to his family. 
												Therefore, where a person 
												directed in his Will that a 
												certain property should pass to 
												his family and be administered 
												by a named person as his 
												successor, the appointment was 
												held to be valid. Vide Nelson v. 
												Nelson (1951) 13 WACA 248.&nbsp; In 
												re Yena (1960) GLR 195 a Will 
												appointed a successor and the 
												court did not disapprove of it. 
												In what was accepted as a Will, 
												the deceased disposed of his 
												estate and appointed one Kwaku 
												Baffu to bury him, pay all his 
												expenses and to succeed him 
												according to Fante custom. The 
												High Court per Adumuah-Bossman 
												J. accepted Kwaku Baffu's 
												position as successor and 
												permitted Kwaku Baffu's own 
												customary successor to act as 
												the deceased's executor and take 
												out Letters of Administration. 
												He made the following revealing 
												observations:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;In this case we have the most 
												valuable evidence of Effuah 
												Fofie, mother-in-law of the 
												testator, who explained that the 
												circumstances how he (the 
												testator) came to summons people 
												together and directed the 
												document to be prepared to 
												provide for his burial on his 
												death and the succession to his 
												estate; ...&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It appears to me that where a 
												person is dealing with his 
												self-acquired property in a Will 
												and does not intend to leave 
												anything for his family, he must 
												be free to appoint any other 
												person to take control of his 
												property and direct him to act 
												as his successor; the rule that 
												a man cannot appoint his own 
												customary successor must be 
												confined to cases where the man 
												during his lifetime was in 
												charge of family property, and 
												should not be extended to 
												testamentary dispositions.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												But this aside, it is my opinion 
												that clause 13, as I have 
												already indicated, does not 
												appoint the appellant as his 
												customary successor. He declared 
												the appellant to inherit him. 
												Having left nothing for the 
												family, the person to inherit 
												him in respect of any residuary 
												property should, according to 
												him, be the appellant, and in 
												his capacity as inheritor, the 
												appellant is to take all 
												properties not devised in the 
												Will.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The provision is simple and 
												clear. You may call it a general 
												disposition, or a residuary 
												disposition. Whichever it is, 
												Act 360 takes care of it in 
												sections 7(4) and 7(5).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Section 7(4) provides:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;A general disposition of the 
												movable or immovable property of 
												a testator shall include any 
												property to which he may have 
												the power to appoint in any 
												manner he may think fit&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Section 7(5) says:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;A general or residuary 
												disposition shall operate to 
												confer a power to exercise a 
												power of appointment, unless a 
												contrary intention appears from 
												the will&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A power of appointment without 
												any limitation or qualification 
												is equivalent to ownership. 
												Under a power of appointment the 
												devisee can appoint the property 
												to himself and so become 
												absolute owner of it unless a 
												contrary intention appears from 
												the Will. Section 13 of the Will 
												clearly professes to give the 
												appellant complete control over 
												anything that falls into 
												residue, and so must be taken as 
												intended to give the appellant 
												an absolute gift. As a general 
												rule an absolute gift cannot be 
												cut down except by clear words 
												and there are no such words in 
												clause 13 or any portion of the 
												Will. The contrary intention 
												required in section 7(5) must be 
												expressed or implied in the 
												Will. If the testator had 
												intended to grant his residuary 
												estate to the Bretuo family, he 
												would have said so; and if he 
												had wanted the appellant to take 
												any property on behalf of, or in 
												trust for, the Bretuo family, he 
												would have said so. In the 
												absence of any such express or 
												implied stipulation, it is not 
												warranted by the rules of 
												construction to say that clause 
												13 must be understood in the 
												sense advocated by the 
												respondent. I think it is wrong 
												for the Court of Appeal to 
												accept the respondent's 
												contention. The argument made by 
												the Respondent and accepted by 
												the Court of Appeal that the 
												testator made a specific devise 
												to the appellant in clause 7 and 
												would have been equally specific 
												in clause 13 if he had wanted 
												the appellant to take absolutely 
												has no impression on this case. 
												The said clause, as I have 
												indicated, is effective to gift 
												away any property to the 
												appellant. I do not know of any 
												rule of law which says that a 
												testator cannot make separate 
												devises to the same person in 
												different clauses in the same 
												Will. And there are no magic 
												words which alone can create an 
												absolute interest. Since the 
												devise in clause 7 does not in 
												any way conflict with the devise 
												in clause 13, I do not see any 
												difficulty in giving effect to 
												both. It was rather for the 
												testator to have made it clear 
												that he wanted the appellant to 
												take the residuary estate on 
												behalf of the family. I hold 
												that the Court of Appeal erred 
												in its conclusion on this point.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What is more, the Court of 
												Appeal failed to consider the 
												Intestate Succession Law and its 
												impact on succession in Ghana 
												today. If that court had 
												adverted its mind to the Law, 
												PNDCL 111, it would have 
												realised that the respondent 
												cannot succeed on his claim. The 
												Intestate Succession Law, 1985, 
												PNDCL 111, has changed the face 
												of the law on succession under 
												intestacy. The old law, prior to 
												PNDCL 111, was generally that 
												upon the death intestate of a 
												Ghanaian his self-acquired 
												property became family 
												property.&nbsp; The family appointed 
												a customary successor to 
												administer the estate on behalf 
												of the family. The system under 
												the customary law was fraught 
												with problem and anomalies and 
												offered very little protection 
												to the nuclear family&#8212;i.e. 
												husband, wife and children. Law 
												111 was passed to reverse the 
												situation. The Law does not 
												apply at all where the deceased 
												leaves behind a valid Will, 
												except in cases where the Will 
												does not cover all his property, 
												in which event, the deceased is 
												said to have died partially 
												intestate and Law 111 Will then 
												apply to that part of the 
												property which is not disposed 
												of in the Will &#8212; see section 2 
												of Law 111.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What we must remember is that 
												Law 111 itself provides the 
												scheme of distribution, giving 
												priority to the spouse and 
												children over all other 
												beneficiaries, reserving for the 
												wife and children household 
												chattels exclusively and also 
												houses (if any) according to the 
												size of the estate and the 
												number of the beneficiaries. In 
												that scheme of distribution only 
												a small fraction devolves in 
												accordance with customary law. 
												In a claim like the instant one 
												before us, therefore, I think 
												that it is necessary for the 
												respondent to identify the 
												particular property he is 
												claiming for the family assuming 
												that his claim that clause 13 of 
												the Will does not vest ownership 
												of the alleged property in the 
												appellant is acceptable. This is 
												because if that alleged 
												residuary property does not go 
												to the appellant, it would only 
												fall into intestacy and liable 
												to be distributed under Law 111; 
												it will not automatically 
												devolve on the family of the 
												deceased. To that extent I agree 
												with the appellant that the 
												judgment of the Court of Appeal 
												is wrong in law.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the whole the majority 
												decision of the Court of Appeal 
												that the appellant is to take 
												the residuary estate in trust 
												for the family is erroneous and 
												not supported by any evidence; 
												and the order bearing on the 
												appellant to administer and 
												manage it on behalf of the 
												family cannot be allowed to 
												stand.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appeal is accordingly 
												allowed. The judgment of the 
												Court of Appeal is hereby set 
												aside, and the judgment of the 
												High Court is restored.</span></p>
