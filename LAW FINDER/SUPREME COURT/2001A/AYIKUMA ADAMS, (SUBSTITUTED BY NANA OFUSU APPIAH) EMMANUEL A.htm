												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The brief facts of the case on 
												appeal are that the plaintiff 
												obtained a customary grant of 
												the land in dispute from the 
												Manche Ankrah family sometime in 
												1962. He went into possession 
												almost immediately. Sometime in 
												1980 the defendant entered that 
												land and started putting up a 
												wooden structure. The plaintiff 
												promptly pulled down and 
												destroyed the wooden structure. 
												A complaint of this fracas was 
												made to the Ghana Police. The 
												Ghana Police did not pursue the 
												complaint and did not 
												investigate it. In the opinion 
												of the Ghana Police, the real 
												issue in dispute is the 
												ownership of the plot of land 
												therefore advised the rival 
												parties to seek redress in a 
												civil&nbsp; court. None of the 
												parties acted on the advice of 
												the Ghana Police.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Sometime in 1981, the defendant 
												commenced building operations on 
												the plot of land. The plaintiff 
												again made a complaint of 
												trespass against the defendant. 
												In the meantime the plaintiff 
												sued the defendant in the High 
												Court Accra and claimed&nbsp; the 
												reliefs stated in the writ. The 
												defendant resisted the claim on 
												the ground that the plot of land 
												was originally allocated to his 
												mother on the occasion 30 
												members of Manche Ankrah family 
												were allocated plots of land, 
												including the plot in dispute, 
												by the Manche Ankrah family. He 
												pleaded that his mother had 
												remained in possession of the 
												plot since the said allocation. 
												In due course, one Nii Ayi 
												Ankrah applied to be joined as 
												co-defendant. He gave two main 
												reasons to support his 
												application. The first was that 
												the plot of land in dispute was 
												part of Manche Ankrah family 
												land. The other reason was that 
												the plot of land was customarily 
												granted to defendant's mother by 
												Manche Ankrah family.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In a summons for directions 
												filed by the lawyer for 
												plaintiff the real issue in 
												dispute was whether the plot of 
												land was granted to the 
												plaintiff or was allocated to 
												the mother of the defendant. I 
												must draw attention to the fact 
												that the plaintiff sought a 
												declaration of title and 
												recovery of possession of the 
												land in dispute the defendant 
												and co-defendant did not 
												counterclaim for a declaration 
												of title to the plot of land in 
												dispute.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The plaintiff gave evidence and 
												called four witnesses including 
												two members of Manche Ankrah 
												family. The defendant gave 
												evidence but did not call any 
												witness. The co-defendant did 
												not give evidence. The trial 
												judge gave judgment for 
												plaintiff and granted the 
												reliefs he sought. The defendant 
												was aggrieved by the judgment 
												and appealed to the Court of 
												Appeal. The appeal of the 
												defendant was dismissed in a 
												unanimous judgment of the Court 
												of Appeal. The defendant was 
												dissatisfied and aggrieved by 
												the judgment of the Court of 
												Appeal and appealed to this 
												Court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel for defendant argued 
												ground (ii) first. He submitted 
												that the Court of Appeal was 
												wrong in giving judgment for the 
												plaintiff when &quot;he did not 
												establish that his alleged grant 
												of one of the 30 plots in 1962 
												by the same family preceded the 
												grant of 30 plots to the 
												displaced 30 members for their 
												resettlement at New Awudome.&quot; He 
												contended that on the evidence 
												on record the plot in dispute, 
												that is plot No.10, was 
												allocated to one Adotey Quarshi. 
												He argued, however, that &quot;there 
												was no basis for what PW3 
												implied that simply because 
												Adotey Quarshi was No.10 on the 
												list of persons plot No.10 
												necessarily was allocated to 
												him, and that plot No.5 also 
												went to Lamley Lamptey because 
												she is No.5 on the list&quot;. He 
												conceded that Lamley Lamptey's 
												name&nbsp; appeared at No.5 but 
												argued that the entry &quot;No.5 was 
												a slight error&quot;. Dealing with 
												the case of the plaintiff he 
												contended that on the evidence 
												on record he was not one of the 
												30 persons to whom the 30 plots 
												of land was allocated. He argued 
												that Exhibit E the Conveyance 
												executed in 1979 on which 
												plaintiff relied as evidence of 
												his title to the land, did not 
												in law pass any title to him 
												because his grantors did not 
												have legal capacity to convey 
												the plot to him. He stated that 
												plaintiff failed to establish 
												and prove that the Manche Ankrah 
												family made a customary grant of 
												the plot of land to him.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In reply counsel for the 
												plaintiff submitted that the 
												defendant failed to establish 
												and prove by evidence the 
												identity of the land he claimed, 
												the date and time of his grant 
												and the nature of his grant. He 
												argued that the documentary 
												evidence, in particular, 
												Exhibits C l and E related to 
												plot No.5 and not to plot No.10 
												which was allocated to one 
												Adotey Quarshi. He contended 
												that the documents put in 
												evidence by the defendant 
												through the surveyor appointed 
												by the court did not identify 
												the plot of land claimed by the 
												defendant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The complaint against the 
												judgment of the Court of Appeal 
												as formulated under ground (ii) 
												on the notice of appeal must be 
												carefully and critically 
												examined. The gravamen of the 
												complaint was expressed as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;........the Court of Appeal was 
												wrong in giving judgment in 
												favour of the plaintiff when he 
												did not establish that his 
												alleged grant of one of the 30 
												plots in 1962 by the same family 
												preceded the grant of the 30 
												plots to the displaced 30 
												members for their settlement at 
												New Awudome&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I have critically read and 
												examined the judgment of the 
												Court of Appeal. For the 
												avoidance of doubt and purpose 
												of clarity I reproduce the 
												passage from the judgment of 
												Afreh JA:-</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												...I have no doubt that the 
												respondent (plaintiff) 
												discharged the onus on him. His 
												evidence that he obtained the 
												land in 1962 from the then 
												undisputed Head of Manche Ankrah 
												Family, Nii Ardey Ankrah, was 
												fully supported by the evidence 
												of four witnesses including 
												three members of the Ankrah 
												family. In my opinion that grant 
												made by Nii Ardey Ankrah was a 
												valid customary grant.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There is no reference by the 
												learned judge to 30 plots and 
												the allocation thereof in the 
												passage. It was not the case of 
												the plaintiff that he was one of 
												the 30 persons each of&nbsp; whom was 
												allocated one of the 30 plots. 
												It was the defendant who claimed 
												the plot in dispute through his 
												late mother Lamley Lamptey. The 
												case of the defendant was that 
												his late mother was one of 30 
												persons to each of whom was 
												allocated one plot out of the 30 
												plots. The Court of Appeal duly 
												considered the case of the 
												defendant on record. In its 
												unanimous judgment the court 
												speaking through Afreh, JA 
												stated:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;It is significant that although 
												the appellant (defendant) said 
												his mother was one of 30 persons 
												who was allocated land at 
												Awudome on their resettlement, 
												he was unable to bring any one 
												to give evidence in support of 
												his claim that his mother was 
												allocated one of the 30 
												plots....&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is clear from the passages 
												reproduced from the judgment of 
												the Court of Appeal that counsel 
												for defendant misconceived 
												findings of fact made by the 
												appellate court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Court of Appeal raised 
												serious issues to expose the 
												weaknesses in the case of the 
												defendant. The defendant did not 
												call any of the boundary owners 
												whose names he had supplied to 
												the surveyor appointed by the 
												court. When it is pointed out 
												that the two documents, Exhibit 
												C and Exhibit C l which 
												defendant handed over to the 
												surveyor for purposes of 
												identifying and plotting the 
												land he claimed showed two 
												different and separate plots, 
												the failure on the part of the 
												defendant to offer any credible 
												evidence of what he called &quot;a 
												small error&quot; was fatal, in the 
												sense that he failed clearly and 
												concisely to identify the plot 
												of land he claimed to be his 
												mother's. I do not intend to 
												burden this opinion with a list 
												of cases on this issue.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Again, in the survey 
												instructions filed by lawyers 
												for defendant, the names of 
												adjoining boundary owners were 
												stated as follows - (1) Aku 
												Ankrah on east; (2) Laryea 
												Mensah on the north and (3) Aku 
												Thompson on the south. The 
												defendant closed his case and 
												did not call any of them. He did 
												not offer any explanation for 
												his omission or failure to call 
												his boundary owners.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I note that counsel for 
												defendant impeached portions of 
												the evidence of PW3 and 
												concluded that his evidence in 
												substance destroyed the case of 
												the plaintiff. He did not go 
												further to state that the 
												evidence of PW3 corroborated 
												that of the defendant. It is 
												therefore necessary to examine 
												the evidence of PW3 at length. 
												The evidence of PW3 on the issue 
												of ownership of the plot of land 
												in dispute reads as follows:-</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The land was granted to the 
												plaintiff in 1962. The land was 
												granted to the plaintiff&nbsp; by the 
												late head of Manche Ankrah 
												family Robert Nii Ardey Ankrah 
												after plaintiff had presented a 
												bottle of schnapps or gin and 
												£50.....&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												PW3 was not an ordinary witness. 
												He testified as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;I am a Ga. I belong to the 
												Manche Ankrah family. I am the 
												treasurer of the Manche Ankrah 
												family. I was acting secretary 
												for the family and I was at all 
												meetings of the family. My house 
												is just about 200 yards from the 
												land in dispute&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The evidence of PW3 was not 
												disputed nor discredited by 
												cross-examination. His evidence 
												corroborated the evidence of 
												plaintiff of the issue of 
												ownership of the land in 
												dispute.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This very witness, PW3 testified 
												about the land allocated to the 
												mother of defendant. Lamley 
												Lamptey. He stated:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;I know the defendant has not 
												been given land near the area in 
												dispute. I know defendant's 
												mother was once offered a piece 
												of land, but she did not accept 
												it. I know plot No.5 was 
												allocated to Lamley Lamptey as 
												shown on Exhibit C l.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is clear from the above that 
												the defendant was allocated plot 
												No.5 as shown on Exhibit C l 
												which document defendant handed 
												over to the court surveyor. As 
												pointed out elsewhere in this 
												opinion, defendant sought to 
												reject his own document on the 
												unexplained ground that Exhibit 
												C l contained a small error.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The evidence on record supports 
												the finding by the trial Judge 
												that the plaintiff successfully 
												discharged the burden he 
												assumed. The plaintiff did not 
												seek to prop up his case by any 
												weakness in the case of the 
												defendant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In this action, the case of the 
												defendant consisted only in 
												repeating what he pleaded on 
												oath. He did not call any 
												evidence to corroborate his own 
												evidence. The witnesses from 
												Manche Ankrah family by their 
												testimony supported and 
												corroborated the evidence of the 
												plaintiff and not that of the 
												defendant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel for defendant dealt at 
												great length with Exhibit C and 
												Exhibit Cl. I need not deal with 
												the issues raised because 
												counsel misconceived the 
												contents of these two documents. 
												As pointed out earlier, the 
												plaintiff had nothing to do with 
												the preparation and or 
												production of these two 
												documents. The plaintiff did not 
												put these two documents in 
												evidence. These two documents 
												were documents which the 
												defendant used to describe and 
												identify the land he claimed. 
												The evidence of the court 
												surveyor who tendered Exhibit C 
												and Exhibit Cl left the trial 
												court in no doubt that Exhibit C 
												identified a plot quite distinct 
												from the plot of land on Exhibit 
												Cl. The trial judge made finding 
												on this issue. The finding was 
												supported by the evidence on 
												record. The Court of Appeal 
												affirmed the finding. Before us, 
												it has not been shown that the 
												finding cannot be supported by 
												the evidence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Ground (iii) on the notice of 
												appeal reads:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(iii) The Court of Appeal erred 
												in accepting and relying on the 
												evidence of PW3 to the effect 
												that although the plaintiff's 
												(defendant's) mother was one of 
												the 30 persons allocated the 30 
												plots she disclaimed it although 
												the plaintiff nowhere confessed 
												in his pleadings that the 
												defendant's mother was one of 
												the 30 members who were 
												allocated these plots but she 
												rejected that plot given to her&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Arguing this ground, counsel for 
												defendant contended that the 
												plaintiff did not plead this 
												substantial and material fact. 
												He argued that the plaintiff 
												should have pleaded this fact 
												and given evidence on it. Since 
												the plaintiff did not do this 
												counsel for defendant submitted 
												that the Court of Appeal should 
												have ignored the evidence of PW3 
												on this issue and not used in 
												its judgment in particular, when 
												the Court of Appeal held that 
												the defendant should have 
												contradicted or denied the 
												evidence that his mother 
												rejected and disclaimed plot 
												No.5.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In reply, counsel for plaintiff 
												submitting that the law enjoined 
												the defendant to object to 
												inadmissible evidence at the 
												time it was tendered. He cited 
												S. 6(1) of the Evidence Decree, 
												1975 (NRCD 323) and also the 
												cases of Asomah vrs. Sevordzie 
												(1987-88) 1 GLR 67 and Atta vs. 
												Adu (1987-88) 1 GLR 233.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is necessary to reproduce S 
												6(1) of NRCD 323 as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;6(1) in every action and at 
												every stage thereof, any 
												objection to the admissibility 
												of the evidence by a party 
												affected thereby shall be made 
												at the time the evidence is 
												offered&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This rule was considered by the 
												Supreme Court in Asomah vs. 
												Sevordzie (1987-88) 1 GLR 67. At 
												holding (1) appears the 
												interpretation of the sub-rule.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;...(i) therefore if at the 
												trial evidence being given by a 
												party had no bearing on the 
												facts he had pleaded it was the 
												duty of opposing counsel to 
												object to that evidence and 
												exclude it. If that was not 
												done, and the evidence got on 
												the record, then a court could 
												not shut its eyes to it in 
												considering the case as a whole, 
												especially if it was against the 
												party that led it...&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The decision in the Asomah case 
												was given on 19th March 1987. 
												Some three months later, on 15 
												June 1987, the Supreme Court in 
												Atta and another v. Adu&nbsp; 
												(1987-88) 1GLR 233 held at 
												holding (1) that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;(1) The Evidence Decree 1975 
												(NRCD 323) S.6(1) provided that 
												where evidence was not pleaded 
												but let in at the trial, the 
												court was obliged to consider 
												the matter so let in...&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The above interpretation of 
												S.6(1) of NRCD 323 is sound and 
												cannot be questioned. I find no 
												merit in this ground of appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel for defendant next 
												argued ground (one) on the 
												notice of appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It reads:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;(1) The Court of Appeal erred 
												in law in rejecting the 
												proposition put forward on 
												behalf of the appellant to the 
												effect that where a plaintiff 
												seeks recovery of possession of 
												land from a defendant who is in 
												possession the plaintiff has the 
												burden of proving a better title 
												to the land and succeeding on 
												the strength of his own case and 
												not on the weakness of the 
												defendant's case.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In arguing this ground of 
												appeal, counsel for defendant 
												sought to rely on ss. 21, 24 and 
												48(1) of NRCD 323. He contended 
												that since the evidence on 
												record established that the 
												defendant was the party in 
												actual possession of the land in 
												dispute the plaintiff could only 
												succeed if the plaintiff proved 
												and established a better title 
												to the plot of land. He did not 
												refer to the pieces of evidence 
												which established and proved 
												that the defendant was the 
												person in actual possession. 
												This was pointed out in the 
												reply of counsel for plaintiff, 
												namely &quot;that no basis exist for 
												this contention&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The law on the burden of 
												persuasion has received 
												respected judicial 
												interpretation. I need not 
												burden this opinion by compiling 
												a list of them. I find that 
												counsel for defendant, did not 
												refer to any evidence to prove 
												and establish that defendant was 
												in possession. In his 
												evidence-in-chief the defendant 
												testified as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;At that time, that is when the 
												grant was made to my mother, the 
												grantor was Nii Ardey Ankrah who 
												was the chief or manche......... 
												The area was properly laid out 
												and my mother's plot was No. 
												10&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I must immediately point out 
												that the defendant did not tell 
												the court when the grant was 
												made by Nii Ardey Ankrah to his 
												mother. The statement of defence 
												did not indicate when the grant 
												was made to the mother of the 
												defendant. Unlike the defendant 
												the plaintiff pleaded at 
												paragraph 3 of the Statement 
												Claim that Nii Ardey Ankrah in 
												or about 1962 made a grant of 
												the land in dispute to him. The 
												plaintiff repeated this averment 
												on oath. The plaintiff provided 
												corroborative evidence of his 
												grant. The defendant as pointed 
												out already, failed and omitted 
												to produce evidence to 
												corroborate his bare and 
												ambiguous evidence that the land 
												was granted to his mother by the 
												very person, Nii Ardey Ankrah. 
												The Court of Appeal was right in 
												law in rejecting the 
												uncorroborated and imprecise 
												evidence of the defendant. 
												Clearly and plainly the sections 
												of NRCD 323 relied on as well as 
												the case law cited by counsel 
												for defence do not apply in the 
												instant case.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel for defendant did not 
												argue the remaining grounds and 
												gave reasons for so doing. I 
												agree that the arguments and 
												submissions to be canvassed and 
												made had been taken care of. No 
												useful purpose would be served 
												in repeating them.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Court of Appeal dismissed 
												the appeal because the findings 
												of fact made by the trial judge 
												were supported by the evidence 
												on record. Before us, counsel 
												for the defendant did not 
												succeed in demonstrating and 
												establishing that the evidence 
												on record do not support the 
												findings of fact. The Court of 
												Appeal concluded its judgment as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The issues before the trial 
												court were issues of fact. He 
												adequately considered the 
												evidence before him.... There is 
												evidence to support his 
												conclusions. It is trite law 
												that an appellate court should 
												not reverse findings of fact 
												made by a trial judge unless 
												there are good reasons for doing 
												that&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I am in entire agreement with 
												the above statement of law. The 
												findings of fact are supported 
												by the evidence on record. I 
												find that grounds (iv), (v) (vi) 
												and (vii) raised issues and 
												matters that have been 
												sufficiently and adequately 
												dealt with in this opinion. No 
												useful purpose would be served 
												if I repeated myself. In the 
												result, I would dismiss the 
												appeal.</span></p>
