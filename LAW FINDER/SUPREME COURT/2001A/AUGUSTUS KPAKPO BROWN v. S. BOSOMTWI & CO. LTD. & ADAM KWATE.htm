												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is an appeal from the 
												decision of the Court of Appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In March, 1981 or thereabout, 
												the plaintiff instituted action 
												against the defendant-company 
												claiming</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) Special damages of 
												¢50,000.00 for the extensive 
												digging of gravel on the 
												plaintiff's land . . .</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) General Damages for trespass

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(c) Perpetual injunction

												agents, labourers, workmen and 
												assigns from entering upon the 
												said piece or parcel of land and 
												interfering in any way 
												whatsoever with the Plaintiff's 
												ownership, possession and 
												occupation of the said land&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The disputed land was described 
												as,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;ALL that piece or parcel of 
												land situate lying at Anyah in 
												the Ga District of the Greater 
												Accra Region of the Republic of 
												Ghana and bounded on the 
												North-West by Ablekuma village 
												on the South-East by Kwashieman 
												village on the North-East by 
												Sowutuom village and on the 
												South-East by Gbawe village&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This description was contained 
												in the Schedule to the 
												plaintiff's claim.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Defendant's response to the 
												claim was that, &quot;. . . the 
												portion of land they have been 
												digging gravel from does not 
												form any part of the area 
												delineated by the plan attached 
												to the Statement of Claim and 
												further state that the land they 
												presently occupy was granted to 
												them by Gbawe Kwatei Family of 
												Gbawe on 4th February, 1980 
												&quot;(see par. 3 of Statement of 
												Defence).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As a result of this the pleading 
												co-defendant was joined in the 
												action. He claimed that,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;. . . the Gbawe Kwatei Family 
												are the owners in possession of 
												a large tract of land made up of 
												all that piece or parcel of land 
												known as Gbawe Kwatei Family 
												situate lying and being at the 
												North-Western part of Accra and 
												bounded on the North-East by 
												Asere Stool Land, on the 
												south-East by Akukajay and Sempe 
												Stool lands and the Sakumo 
												Plains, on the South-West by the 
												Tetegbu Stream, Densu River and 
												James Town land and on the 
												North-West by Djanmang Hill, 
												aboabo Hill, Kubenan Hill and 
												Atuase Hill. . .&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On 9th January, 1989, the court 
												ordered that the land in dispute 
												be surveyed by a Licensed 
												surveyor, one Mr. Harry Reynolds 
												and a common plan drawn with the 
												respective site plans of the 
												parties superimposed on it. The 
												parties were ordered to file 
												their instructions to the 
												surveyor. A plan pursuant to the 
												order was made and tendered in 
												evidence by the Surveyor as 
												Exhibit CE1.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The original plaintiff died on 
												31st May, 1981 and was 
												substituted by the present 
												plaintiff on 19th February, 
												1982. On 18/1/90, one Nii 
												Chabukwei II, Chief of Anyaa 
												applied to be joined in the 
												action as Co-plaintiff since he 
												claimed, the land in dispute was 
												attached to the Anyaa Stool. On 
												3rd March, 1990 the court 
												granted the application and Nii 
												Chabukwei II was joined as a 
												co-plaintiff. The plaintiff 
												appealed to the Court of Appeal 
												on this grant of joinder and the 
												Court of Appeal in allowing the 
												appeal set aside the order of 
												'joinder'. The action therefore 
												continued in the High Court 
												between the plaintiff on one 
												side, and the defendant an the 
												co-defendant on the other.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial judge found against 
												the plaintiff and dismissed his 
												claim. He gave judgment for the 
												co-defendant on his 
												counterclaim. The plaintiff not 
												satisfied appealed to the Court 
												of Appeal which also dismissed 
												his appeal. The appeal now 
												before this court is by the 
												plaintiff against the judgment 
												of the Court of Appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Apart from the original grounds 
												of appeal filed by the 
												appellant, he subsequently filed 
												two notices of additional 
												grounds which he intended, with 
												leave of court, to argue. Leave 
												was accordingly granted. 
												However, looking at the original 
												and additional grounds filed, 
												the additional grounds filed on 
												28.5.2001 covered all the other 
												grounds; it was upon these that 
												the appellant argued his case. 
												The gravemen of the appellant's 
												submission was that both 
												judgments of the trial court and 
												the Court of Appeal were against 
												the weight of evidence and that 
												some findings by both courts 
												were not supported by the 
												evidence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												From the pleadings, the 
												evidence, and Exhibit CEI, (the 
												plan ordered by the court), it 
												is obvious that the main issue 
												or matter of controversy between 
												the parties is the location of 
												the common boundary between 
												them; both having agreed that 
												they shared a common boundary.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The courts below were under no 
												illusion as to the burden of 
												proof cast on the parties. Since 
												both were claiming title to 
												land, they had the equal task of 
												identifying the land they each 
												claimed, with clarity; this they 
												discharge by showing clearly all 
												the boundaries of the land and 
												what overt acts of ownership 
												they have exercised on the land 
												over the years. In support of 
												their view, the courts referred 
												to the cases of Bissali v. 
												Gyampoh III (1964) GLR 381 and 
												Bedu v. Agbi (1972) 2 GLR 239 
												(CA), among others.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In making his case, the 
												plaintiff gave evidence himself 
												and called three other witnesses 
												namely PW1 Eric Coleman an 
												archivist; PW2 Samuel Mensah 
												Addo from the Lands Commission 
												and PW3 Agyenim Boateng also 
												from the Lands Commission. These 
												witnesses had been called to 
												tender certain documents 
												including a plan (Exhibit A), 
												ostensibly to help identify the 
												plaintiff's land. The next 
												witness for the plaintiff was 
												one Thelma Manye Ewusie (PW4) 
												from the National Achieves; she 
												represented the Chief Archivist. 
												She tendered in evidence &quot;the 
												proceedings and judgment in the 
												matter of the Public Lands 
												Ordinance and in the matter of 
												Land Acquired situate at 
												MacCarthy Hill, Accra, Weija 
												Road, and required for a Leper 
												settlement, Nii Amassah, Nii Koi 
												Olai v. Nii Kofi Akirashie James 
												Town Mantse, Accra and ors. 1950 
												- 1951 Ref. No. WACA 16/1952&quot;; 
												this was accepted in evidence 
												and marked as Exhibit H.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The co-defendant gave evidence 
												on behalf of the defence. He 
												called in support of his case 
												one Godson Seth Owusu-Ansah, 
												(DW1), a Circuit Court Registrar 
												attached to the High Court 
												Registry who tendered on behalf 
												of the Chief Registrar, an 
												affidavit dated 1/8/22 (Exh. 7) 
												and a judgment in the case of 
												John R. Quartey v. Nii Boye 
												Quartey &amp; Anor. Dated 23/9/49 
												(Exh. 8). He tendered in 
												addition, Exhibits 9, 10 and 11. 
												One Comfort Afful who next gave 
												evidence for the defence was 
												wrongly referred to as DW1. She 
												was a farmer and had worked on 
												the land which was given her by 
												the co-defendant's family, for 
												about 38 years. DW2, Ataa Kwame 
												Gamadii a farmer living at 
												Gbawe, had worked on the land 
												given him by the Gbawe Mantse 
												since 1963 without any 
												challenge; he mentioned other 
												farmers working in the area on 
												the land in dispute, which land 
												had also been given them by the 
												Gbawe Mantse. DW3, Okai Lartey, 
												a Licensed surveyor, tendered in 
												evidence Exhibit 1, a plan he 
												had prepared himself.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial judge evaluated the 
												evidence and observed,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;. . . It is quite clear from 
												the above that the plaintiff has 
												put up confused and inconsistent 
												claim&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Before arriving at this 
												conclusion, the trial judge had 
												made certain findings of fact by 
												comparing the evidence given and 
												the pleadings. He found that the 
												appellant had given conflicting 
												description of the land he 
												claimed; he said the land the 
												plaintiff claimed by his 
												pleadings &quot;is entirely different 
												from the land claimed in his 
												evidence on oath&quot;. This has 
												evoked the appellant's attack 
												that &quot;the trial judge dismissed 
												the case of the plaintiff on the 
												sole ground that it was contrary 
												to the rule in Dam v. Addo 
												(!962) 2 GLR 200 SC. In this 
												appeal the appellant has raised 
												the same issue. According to 
												him, &quot;the appeal judgment on 
												this and on the further ground 
												that the plaintiff/appellant had 
												failed to prove the western 
												boundaries of the land he 
												claimed&quot; are not supported on 
												the evidence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Court of Appeal, [Lamptey, 
												J.A. (as he then was) reading 
												the judgment], had, by way of 
												re-hearing dealt with all the 
												evidence adduced at the trial 
												court, including the documents 
												and previous judgments. Its 
												analysis and evaluation were 
												exhaustive. The court also made 
												some findings in support of the 
												conclusion came to by the trial 
												judge.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As stated earlier in this 
												judgment, the trial court and 
												the Court of Appeal were quite 
												aware of the burden of proof 
												required of the parties since 
												they both claimed title to a 
												specific piece of land. They 
												were both satisfied that the 
												plaintiff had failed to identify 
												the land he claimed and that he 
												failed to adduce evidence of 
												acts of ownership over the area 
												he had claimed. On the other 
												hand, the co-defendant had, on 
												the preponderance of the 
												probabilities satisfied the 
												court of the identity of the 
												area he claimed and also offered 
												positive evidence of overt acts 
												of ownership exercised over the 
												land.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												By consent of the parties, one 
												Harry Reynolds, CW1 was ordered 
												by the trial court to prepare a 
												composite plan of the land in 
												dispute. To assist him with data 
												for this exercise, the trial 
												judge ordered the parties to 
												file survey instructions. Harry 
												Reynolds, the surveyor, during 
												the trial tendered in evidence 
												Exhibit 'CE1' as the composite 
												plan. On this issue Lamptey, JA 
												(as he then was) remarked,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Therefore in the language of 
												the Laryea Vs. Oforiwah case the 
												court had before it 'the 
												necessary dimensions of the area 
												of land being claimed by each of 
												the parties. In this case, the 
												plan also showed very clearly 
												and distinctly the area of the 
												alleged trespass committed by 
												the defendant company in &quot;red 
												colour&quot;. Thus the evidence 
												contained on Exhibit 'CE1' set 
												the stage and defined the limits 
												of the contest between plaintiff 
												and co-defendant. . .&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Justice Lamptey then went on to 
												review the evidence of identity 
												and referred copiously from the 
												evidence of the plaintiff, in 
												particular, the plaintiff's 
												evidence given on 28.6.89 (page 
												62 of the record of proceedings) 
												The plaintiff said,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The purpose of Exhibit F2 was 
												to substitute the plan of the 
												land. Our family found the need 
												to change the plan because an 
												error was detected on the part 
												of the surveyor on the plan he 
												made attached to Exhibit F1. The 
												surveyor to Exhibit F2 drew a 
												smaller plan of land and shifted 
												part of our land to Gbawe. The 
												surveyor did not use the plan of 
												Exhibit 'C' as the basis of the 
												plan attached to Exhibit F1&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The plaintiff did not explain 
												how the surveyor's mistake or 
												error was detected by his 
												family. It was also surprising 
												that the plaintiff who had 
												earlier described the area 
												covered by the defendant as 'no 
												man's land' suddenly came to 
												assert title to that area when 
												the co-defendant had already 
												claimed that the supposed 'no 
												man's land' was part of his land 
												a portion or which he had 
												lawfully granted to the 
												defendant company. When Nii 
												Chabukwei II applied to join in 
												the action as co-plaintiff, the 
												plaintiff vehemently opposed the 
												application to such an extent 
												that even though the High Court 
												granted the application, the 
												plaintiff had the order vacated 
												on appeal. Yet it has not been 
												disputed that Nii Chabukwei II 
												the incumbent chief of Anyaa, is 
												the owner by succession to all 
												the Anyaa lands of which the 
												plaintiff claims a portion. Nii 
												Chabukwei II was not even called 
												to give evidence of the 
												boundaries of the Anyaa lands. 
												The plaintiff, as the trial 
												judge observed, was a confused 
												man with regard to the 
												identification of the land he 
												claimed. &quot;In the result&quot;, says 
												Justice Lamptey, it is plain and 
												clear that the plaintiff failed 
												to identify and demarcate his 
												western boundary with the land 
												of the co-defendant's family.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Lamptey, JA (as he then was) 
												went further to deal with the 
												various documents (including 
												plans and previous judgments) 
												and came to the conclusion that 
												they did not affect the issues 
												before the court. I find his 
												evaluation of these documents 
												faultless.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The co-defendant on the other 
												hand described his land with the 
												clarity it required and produced 
												evidence of acts of ownership by 
												persons who were on the land. 
												The trial judge considered and 
												determined the counter-claim 
												according to law. In my view, as 
												was that of the Court of Appeal, 
												the trial judge cannot be 
												faulted in the way he considered 
												the case of the co-defendant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Thus, before us are two 
												concurrent findings of fact by 
												two courts of competent 
												jurisdiction: A trial court 
												which saw and heard evidence 
												from witnesses before it and an 
												appellate court which by way of 
												re-hearing reviewed and 
												evaluated the evidence at the 
												trial and came to a conclusion 
												of its own. In Koglex Ltd. 
												(No.2) v. Field (2000) SCGLR 
												175, the Supreme Court however 
												observed,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The very fact that the first 
												appellate court had confirmed 
												the judgment of the trial court 
												does not relieve. The second 
												appellate court of its duty to 
												satisfy itself that the first 
												appellate court's judgment is, 
												like the trial court's, also 
												justified by the evidence on 
												record, for an appeal, at 
												whatever stage, is by way of 
												rehearing&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												But it held inter alia,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;where the first appellate court 
												had confirmed the findings of 
												the trial court, the second 
												appellate court would not 
												interfere with the concurrent 
												findings unless it was 
												established with absolute 
												clearness that some blunder or 
												error resulting in a miscarriage 
												of justice, was apparent in the 
												way in which the lower court had 
												dealt with the facts. Achoro v. 
												Akoufela (1996-97) SCGLR 209 
												cited&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I have read both judgments of 
												the trial court and the Court of 
												Appeal and I am satisfied that 
												the findings and conclusions 
												came to, were supported by the 
												evidence on record and that no 
												miscarriage of justice has 
												resulted from the decisions. I 
												would accordingly dismiss the 
												appeal.</span></p>
