												JUDGMENT</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												ATUGUBA, J.S.C.:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The facts of this case, briefly 
												stated, are that on the 14th day 
												of April, the 
												plaintiffs/respondents/respondents 
												entered into a contract of 
												carriage with the Carriers, G &amp; 
												C Lines, the 
												defendants/appellants/appellants' 
												principals in London and owners 
												of the vessel M/V Republic Di 
												Genova, whereby plaintiffs' 
												cargo of 2 Road Rollers, 24 
												tubes of grease and 6 tins of 
												brake fluid valued £57,507.00 
												were to be carried from Tilbury 
												Port in England to Tema Port in 
												Ghana.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The plaintiffs' said goods were 
												to be delivered by the 
												defendants, the said agents of G 
												&amp; C Lines. Even though the 
												container in which the said 
												goods were put arrived at Tema 
												Port, the goods themselves were 
												wholly lost at sea. The 
												plaintiffs as consignees 
												therefore brought an action 
												against the defendants claiming</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												i. The sum of £57,507.00 being 
												the C &amp; F value of the cargo;
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												ii. Damages of £200,000.00 for 
												negligence and/or fundamental 
												breach of contract of carriage 
												on the&nbsp; part of the carriers and 
												their accredited agents, Sequana 
												Maritime Limited, who acted as 
												shippers for and on behalf of 
												the carriers;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												iii. Loss of use of two road 
												rollers from 22/5/92 till date 
												of judgment at the rate of 
												¢120,000.00 per day.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The plaintiffs recovered 
												judgment from the High Court, 
												constituted by Benin, J.A. 
												sitting as an additional judge 
												of the High Court. This judgment 
												was unanimously affirmed by the 
												Court of Appeal, coram Sapong, 
												Essilfie-Bondzie and Baddoo, 
												JJ.A.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												From that judgment the 
												defendants have further appealed 
												to this Court.&nbsp; It was submitted 
												at length by Mr. Kudjawu, 
												Counsel for the defendants that 
												since the container in which the 
												plaintiffs' goods were stored 
												arrived at Tema Harbour together 
												with all other goods on board 
												except those of the plaintiffs, 
												which had moved in the 
												container, it should be inferred 
												that the plaintiffs' goods were 
												lost through insufficient 
												lashing or securing within the 
												container and as that was the 
												plaintiffs' act they ought to 
												fail having regard to the terms 
												of the bill of lading which 
												exempted the carriers from 
												liability in those 
												circumstances.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It was further submitted that 
												the Courts below erred in law in 
												placing the onus of proof on the 
												defendants as to how the 
												plaintiffs' goods were packed in 
												the said container since that is 
												a fact peculiarly within the 
												plaintiffs' knowledge.&nbsp; It is 
												certainly a non sequitur to 
												argue that insufficiency of 
												packing must necessarily be 
												inferred in the circumstances of 
												this case.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There is no doctrine that goods 
												that are sufficiently packed can 
												never move or that a plaintiff 
												cannot recover for negligence if 
												his goods turn out to be the 
												only ones lost or damaged in a 
												carriage by sea.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I, at any rate, hold that the 
												foregoing contentions have been 
												superseded by the concurrent 
												finding of fact by the courts 
												below that the goods had been 
												sufficiently packed. The 
												plaintiffs led evidence, 
												confirmed by Exhibit E which was 
												admitted in evidence without 
												objection, that the plaintiffs' 
												goods were wheel locked and side 
												blocked and secured by wire 
												fasteners connected to the floor 
												eyes of the container. These 
												measures were taken by the 
												plaintiffs' agents, Lister Plant 
												Sales of England, obviously for 
												an oceanic journey and there is 
												no reason for holding them to be 
												insufficient.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Mr. Kudjawu further submitted on 
												behalf of the defendants that 
												the stowing of the plaintiffs' 
												goods on the upper deck of the 
												ship was covered by a custom or 
												general practice and also the 
												terms of the contract.&nbsp; Mr. 
												Kudjawu however has not gone as 
												far as showing that custom, 
												general practice or the contract 
												authorized, warranted or covered 
												the negligent stowing of the 
												goods.&nbsp; Indeed the contract of 
												carriage evidenced by the bill 
												of lading required the 
												defendants to properly and 
												carefully load, handle, stow, 
												carry, keep, care for and 
												discharge the goods.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Mr. Kudjawu however contends 
												that it was decided by the 
												English House of Lords in 
												ALBACORA S.R.L. VRS. WESTCOTT &amp; 
												LAURANCE LINE, LTD. (1966) 2 
												Lloyd's Law Reports 53 that the 
												expression</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;&nbsp; &#8220;properly&#8221; means in 
												accordance with a sound system. 
												A sound system does not mean a 
												system suited to all the 
												weakness and idiosyncrasies of a 
												particular cargo, but a sound 
												system under all circumstances 
												in relation to the general 
												practice of carriage of goods by 
												sea.&#8221; (emphasis supplied).
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Mr. Kudjawu must have had in 
												mind the speech of Lord Pearce 
												in that case when he said at p. 
												62 as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The word &quot;properly&quot; presumably 
												adds something to the word 
												&quot;carefully&#8221;. In G.H. Renton &amp; 
												Co. Ltd. vrs. Palmyra Trading 
												Corporation of Panama, [1957] 
												A.C.149, this House construed it 
												as meaning &#8216;upon a sound 
												system&#8217;. A sound system does not 
												mean a system suited to all the 
												weaknesses and idiosyncrasies of 
												a particular cargo, but a sound 
												system under all the 
												circumstances in relation to the 
												general practice of carriage of 
												goods by sea.&nbsp; It is tantamount 
												, I think, to efficiency.&#8221; 
												(emphasis supplied).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												But the context in which Lord 
												Pearce said so shows that he was 
												addressing himself to the 
												situation of what is popularly 
												called an inherent and 
												undisclosed vice or latent 
												defect of the goods to be 
												carried. In the Albacora case 
												the goods were fish, which 
												unknown to the carriers needed 
												refrigeration in certain 
												temperatures, a fact which was 
												never communicated to the 
												carriers. That that was the 
												intendment of Lord Pearce is 
												clear from the following 
												passages at page 62-63 in his 
												speech:-</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Was it intended that the Hague 
												Rules should make a radical 
												departure from the common law, 
												and impose on the ship an 
												obligation to use the best 
												possible means of carriage, 
												suited to the weakness of the 
												cargo, even if those means were 
												not within the competence of the 
												ship? Was it intended that if a 
												cargo had only the strength to 
												endure a quick passage in the 
												Queen Mary, but not the slower 
												and rougher passage in a tramp 
												steamer, then the tramp steamer, 
												which without any prior 
												information as to its weakness 
												agreed to carry it, was 
												automatically liable for its 
												deterioration during the voyage? 
												Such an intention would produce 
												a novel and unfair result. And 
												such an intention would 
												certainly have been expressed in 
												clear language.&nbsp; It would not 
												have been left in ambiguity 
												dependent on the one word 
												&quot;properly&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Here the goods to be carried 
												were unfit to support the 
												ordinary strain of the journey. 
												They were bound to deteriorate 
												in the normal conditions of the 
												ship. (In estimating the 
												properties of the goods one can, 
												I think, take into account the 
												notices on the packages. They 
												bore the stencilled words that 
												the goods must be stowed &#8220;away 
												from engines and boilers&#8221;- words 
												that clearly imply that they 
												need not be kept in a 
												refrigerator.)&nbsp; The goods 
												contained dormant bacilli which 
												must inevitably be activated by 
												the temperatures normally to be 
												encountered in the Mediterranean 
												at that time of the year.&nbsp; 
												Clearly they were unfit for the 
												journey which the shipper had 
												contracted for them to 
												undertake.&nbsp; And it was this 
												which caused the loss.&nbsp; This 
												unfitness was an inherent vice 
												in the goods for which under Art 
												IV, r. 2 (m), neither the 
												carrier nor the ship is 
												responsible.&#8221; (emphasis 
												supplied)</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In any case it is clear that the 
												majority of their Lordships held 
												that the expression &#8220;properly&#8221; 
												related also to the nature of 
												the goods. This is succinctly 
												stated in holding (1) of the 
												headnote as follows&#8221;&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Held, by H.L. (Lord REID, Lord 
												GUEST and Lord UPJOHN). (1) that 
												&#8220;properly&#8221; in Art. III, r. 2, 
												meant in accordance with a sound 
												system; and the obligation on 
												carrier in that rule was to 
												adopt a system which was sound 
												in light of all knowledge which 
												carrier had or ought to have had 
												about nature of goods; that 
												shipowners had no reason to 
												suppose that fish required any 
												different treatment from that 
												which it received; and that, 
												therefore shipowners were not in 
												breach of contract.&quot; (emphasis 
												supplied)</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the CONTINENTAL SHIPPER 
												(1976) 2 Lloyd's Law Reports 234 
												when uncrated automobiles 
												suffered dents and scratches the 
												Canadian Federal Court of Appeal 
												unanimously held per Mr. Justice 
												LE DAIN at page 236 as follows:-</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;We are in agreement with the 
												finding of the trial judge that 
												the automobiles were reasonably 
												secured for the voyage but that 
												they were stowed too closely 
												together to permit the necessary 
												passage of crew and stevedores 
												between them in such a manner 
												as, by the exercise of 
												reasonable care, to avoid damage 
												as a result of bodily contact 
												with the automobiles.&quot; (emphasis 
												supplied)</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This clearly shows that the duty 
												of a carrier properly to carry 
												goods must be discharged having 
												regard, inter alia, to the 
												nature of the goods and all the 
												circumstances of the case. This 
												will dictate the appropriate 
												manner of stowage of the goods.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The question then is whether the 
												defendants did properly and 
												carefully carry the plaintiffs' 
												goods in this case. The evidence 
												clearly establishes that they 
												did not do so. There is no 
												dispute that they knew the 
												nature of the plaintiffs' goods, 
												namely very heavy wheeled 
												machinery and yet in stowing it 
												on the upper deck of the ship 
												they took no steps to secure the 
												container in such a way that in 
												strong and rough currents its 
												said contents would not be 
												subjected to too much strain nor 
												that they would not gush out 
												into the sea. Indeed the 
												container was carried with its 
												face to the sea, as if purposely 
												to facilitate, aid and abet the 
												gushing out of its contents into 
												the sea.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Mr. Kudjawu contends that 
												Exhibit M which explained how 
												the loss of the goods occurred 
												was wrongly rejected as hearsay 
												and self-serving, having regard 
												to the fact that it was a record 
												made by the Master of the ship 
												in the log book at the time of 
												the loss of the goods, as a 
												business record. He relies on 
												Section 125 of the Evidence 
												Decree, 1975 (N.R.C.D. 323), 
												which, as far as relevant 
												provides as follows:-</span></p>

												whether carried on for profit or

												<p class="MsoNormal">

												(4) A hearsay statement

												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the facts of this case 
												Counsel's complaint relating to 
												Exhibit M is well founded. 
												Indeed Exhibit M was tendered in 
												evidence without objection. In 
												such a case as also provided by 
												Section 117 of the Evidence 
												Decree:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;117. Hearsay evidence is not 
												admissible except as otherwise 
												provided by this Decree or any 
												other enactment or by agreement 
												of the parties.&#8221; (emphasis 
												supplied).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The admissibility of log book 
												entries seems to be a common 
												feature in the common law world. 
												Thus in PRACTICE NOTE (EVIDENCE: 
												SHIP'S LOG) (1953) 1 WLR 262 it 
												is stated:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;In examination-in-chief a 
												ship's officer in a collision 
												case gave evidence that the 
												entries in the deck movement 
												book and the deck scrap log-book 
												were in his handwriting, and his 
												counsel thereupon applied for 
												and obtained leave from the 
												court to put in these documents 
												as evidence under the Evidence 
												Act, 1938.&#8221; (emphasis supplied).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												See also the Canadian case of 
												THE WASHINGTON (1976) 2 Lloyd's 
												Law Reports 453 at 457. But 
												Exhibit M does not exculpate the 
												defendants from negligence. It 
												shows quite clearly that the 
												carriers' attention was drawn to 
												the question of the safety of 
												the plaintiffs' goods on board 
												when the process of their 
												perdition had reached an 
												advanced stage. It was a seaman 
												who alerted the Master that he 
												heard a loud noise from the deck 
												and that at the same time he 
												noticed something fall into the 
												sea.&nbsp; He saw the container with 
												open doors toward the sea. They 
												then tried, unsuccessfully to 
												find a &quot;new course with less 
												pitching&#8221;. They tried to prevent 
												the remaining machinery, which 
												seemed to be a &#8220;roller for 
												flattening roads&#8221; from also 
												falling into the sea by closing 
												the doors of the container as 
												&#8220;best as possible&#8221; by &#8220;using 
												chain&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is quite clear therefore that 
												the carriers did not check, from 
												time to time on the state of the 
												goods during the course of the 
												voyage as Pilcher J. in the 
												SVENSKA TRAKTOR AKTIEBOLAGET &nbsp;VRS.&nbsp; 
												MARITIME&nbsp; AGENCIES (SOUTHAMPTON) 
												LD. (1953) 3 WLR 426 would 
												expect a prudent carrier to do.
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Again in THE WASHINGTON (1972) 2 
												Lloyd&#8217;s Law Reports 453 the 
												carriers had a system of 
												monitoring the condition and 
												weather of the sea, but 
												eventually failed to comply with 
												weather information received.&nbsp; 
												In holding them liable for the 
												resultant loss of the 
												plaintiff&#8217;s goods, Mr. Justice 
												Heald of the Canadian Federal 
												Court, Trial Division, held at 
												page 460 as follows:-</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The master took good care of 
												his ship but was negligent in 
												his care of the cargo by not 
												altering course much earlier 
												than he did which would have 
												enabled him to get away from the 
												converging storm centre.&nbsp; For 
												these reasons, the defendants 
												are not, in my view, entitled to 
												rely on the exculpatory 
												provisions of art. IV, r. 2 
												(a).&#8221; (emphasis supplied).
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the instant case the carriers 
												tried to wriggle out of the 
												undoubtedly much stormy zone 
												only when the worst was already 
												happening to the plaintiffs' 
												goods and were clearly 
												negligent.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the circumstances, though the 
												Courts below erred in excluding 
												Exhibit M from their 
												consideration of the case, no 
												miscarriage of justice, let 
												alone substantial miscarriage of 
												justice occurred, for the error 
												as demonstrated rather enured to 
												the defendants' benefit. </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As provided by Section 5(3)(a) 
												and (b) of the Evidence Decree:-</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;No finding, verdict, judgment 
												or decision shall be set aside, 
												altered or reversed on appeal or 
												review because of the erroneous 
												exclusion of evidence unless -</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) the substance of the 
												excluded evidence was made known 
												to the court by the question 
												asked, an offer of proof, or by 
												any other means;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) the court which decides on 
												the effect of the error also 
												determines that the excluded 
												evidence should have been 
												admitted and that the erroneous 
												exclusion of the evidence 
												resulted in a substantial 
												miscarriage of justice.&#8221; 
												(emphasis supplied). </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As to the award of damages for 
												loss of use the complaint that 
												they were not proved is 
												untenable. The trial judge 
												relied on judicial notice on the 
												matter and this is warranted by 
												Section 9 of the Evidence 
												Decree.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In similar circumstances the 
												Court of Appeal in BANNERMAN VRS. 
												FRETETE ODOMANKOMA JEWELLERY 
												LTD. (1989-90) 1 GLR 534 held as 
												per holding (4) of the headnote 
												as follows:-</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;(4) An appellate court would 
												only interfere with the trial 
												court's assessment of damages if 
												satisfied that the judge had 
												acted on a wrong principle of 
												law or had misapprehended the 
												facts or had for those or other 
												reasons made a wholly erroneous 
												estimate of the damages 
												suffered. In the instant case, 
												the trial judge was, on the 
												facts, justified in taking 
												judicial notice of the decline 
												in the value of the cedi and in 
												considering the enhancement of 
												the value of the house and also 
												in assessing the damages as at 
												the date of judgment.&nbsp; It was 
												moreover plain that if the trial 
												judge had adhered strictly to 
												the fate of the cedi as a guide 
												in assessing damages on the 
												amount expended on the house, 
												the damages for the investment 
												alone would have exceeded ¢150 
												million. The award of ¢33.2 
												million was therefore 
												reasonable.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It was also submitted that the 
												Courts below erred in awarding 
												damages to the respondents 
												higher than warranted by the 
												contractual limitation as to 
												liability as per the Hague 
												Rules.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In any event, the evidence of 
												the higher damages awarded which 
												would have been inadmissible as 
												irrelevant under Section 51 of 
												the Evidence Decree, was let in 
												without objection and was 
												rightly considered by the Courts 
												below. See EDWARD NASSER &amp; CO. 
												LTD. VRS. MCVROOM (1996-97) 
												SCGLR 468, holding (1) of the 
												headnote which states as 
												follows:-</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;If a party failed [as required 
												by the Evidence Decree, 1975 
												(NRCD 323), s 6(1)] to object to 
												the admission of evidence which 
												in his view, ought not be led, 
												he would be precluded by section 
												5(1) of the Decree to complain 
												on appeal or review about the 
												admission of that evidence 
												unless the admission had 
												occasioned a substantial 
												miscarriage of justice. Factors 
												helping to determine whether or 
												not a substantial miscarriage of 
												justice had occurred have been 
												set out in section 5(2).&nbsp; 
												Consequently, where evidence in 
												respect of an unpleaded fact had 
												been led without objection, the 
												trial court was bound to 
												consider that evidence in the 
												overall assessment of the merits 
												of the case, unless that 
												evidence was inadmissible per 
												se.&nbsp; An appeal or a review 
												against the judgment might 
												succeed only where it was 
												established that the admission 
												had occasioned a substantial 
												miscarriage of justice. In the 
												instant case, the evidence on 
												the building permit, certificate 
												of occupancy and the age of the 
												house did not constitute 
												inadmissible evidence per se. 
												Since no objection to them was 
												taken at the trial, the trial 
												judge and the Court of Appeal 
												had rightly considered them as 
												part of the evidence in the 
												overall assessment of the case; 
												and the appellant had failed in 
												establishing that the admission 
												of that evidence had occasioned 
												a substantial miscarriage of 
												justice.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												For all these reasons the appeal 
												is dismissed.</span></p>
