												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In his Writ of Summons, the 
												plaintiff/respondent 
												(hereinafter referred to as the

												hereinafter referred to as the 
												defendant),</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;(a) A declaration of title to 
												all that piece or parcel of land 
												known as and called MPREBUA 
												lying being and situate at 
												Breman Asikuma bounded by TUROME, 
												KYIDOMHENE's FAMILY LAND, 
												ASIKUMA BENIN and BREMAN ASIKUMA 
												OMANHENE's LAND which is more 
												particularly delineated by the 
												PLAN attached to the Writ of

												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) Recovery of possession of 
												the said land.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(c) ¢5,000.00 (Five thousand 
												Cedis) damages for trespass for 
												wanton destruction of 
												plaintiff&#8217;s tenants&#8217; farms and 
												the cultivation of new farms for 
												his exclusive enjoyment to the 
												detriment of the plaintiff.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(d) Perpetual injunction 
												restraining the defendant, his 
												agents, servants and/or workmen 
												from having anything to do with 
												the said land&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The defendant resisted the 
												plaintiff&#8217;s claim.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The parties gave evidence and 
												called witnesses in support of 
												their case.&nbsp; The trial court 
												gave judgment for the plaintiff. 
												The defendant appealed against 
												the decision of the Court of 
												Appeal which on 31st March, 1994 
												affirmed the decision of the 
												trial court and dismissed the 
												appeal. Concluding its judgment 
												the court said,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;(1) That the paramount or 
												allodial title is vested in the 
												plaintiff. The appeal therefore 
												fails, in so far as it relates 
												to paramount or allodial title.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) Usufructuary title in the 
												areas of disputed land 
												established to be occupied by 
												the defendant is decided in 
												favour of the defendant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appeal is allowed to this 
												extent but subject to the 
												defendant continuing to pay rent 
												as previously.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3) The appeal in respect of 
												trespass and damages were not 
												argued before us and is 
												dismissed as abandoned.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(4) An order for injunction 
												granted by the High Court also 
												fails. The appeal against that 
												injunction succeeds and is 
												allowed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												We award costs of 100,000.00 
												Cedis to the 
												plaintiff/respondent.&nbsp; Both 
												Counsel agree on Mr. Benin, a 
												Cape Coast Licensed Surveyor to 
												carry out the order in the light 
												of the evidence and the plan 
												before the trial court.&nbsp; Each 
												side is to deposit 50,000.00 
												Cedis towards his preparation&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On what basis did the Court of 
												Appeal make the final orders?&nbsp; 
												The trial judge had concluded 
												his judgement thus,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;&#8230; All told I do say that on the 
												balance of probabilities the 
												plaintiff should succeed on his 
												claim.&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I therefore enter judgment for 
												the plaintiff&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Apart from the claim for title, 
												the plaintiff asked also for 
												recovery of possession and 
												damages for trespass as well as 
												an order for injunction. Since 
												no damages were awarded against 
												the defendant, it was not clear 
												from the judgment whether any 
												trespass had been committed and 
												if so in what area? Which 
												portion of the area then was the 
												plaintiff entitled to recover? 
												Although the defendant did not 
												plead that his land was called 
												ABINA, subsequent evidence 
												showed that there was land by 
												that name even though this land 
												was included in the whole of the 
												plaintiff&#8217;s land. Evidence was 
												also led to show that the 
												defendant or his tenants had 
												occupied portions of the 
												defendant's ABINA LAND which as 
												stated before was included in 
												the MPREBUA LAND. Some of these 
												occupants had lived on the land 
												for some time. Were they paying 
												rents and if so how much?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												From&nbsp; the evidence the trespass 
												complained of and which had 
												provoked this action was at a 
												small place which had originally 
												been occupied by one Egya Ata 
												and subsequently succeeded to by 
												Nsiah. The trial judge had not 
												made any findings of fact on 
												these occupations. He concluded 
												his judgment thus,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;&#8230;Fair enough, plaintiff led 
												traditional evidence likewise 
												defendant. There being none to 
												prefer I had to rely on recent 
												acts of possession and or 
												ownership. I have already said 
												that Exhibit 'A' a court 
												document speaks with the voice 
												of evidence. Exhibit &#8216;A&#8217; says 
												permission to settle the case 
												was given on 12th March, 1980 to 
												report on 23rd March, 1980. And 
												on 25th March, 1980 settlement 
												was reported. The defendant 
												herein knew of Sakyi Appiah's 
												settlement. There is evidence 
												that he was present at the 
												settlement. He knows of Exhibit 
												'2'. He must have brought the 
												contents thereof to the notice 
												of the said Sakyi Appiah. If he 
												did not then whose fault.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												At the end of the day Sakyi 
												Appiah gave judgment for the 
												plaintiff. Thus reliance on 
												Exhibit '2' by the defendant I 
												do say has no probative value 
												when one talks of recent acts of 
												possession and or ownership. 
												Exhibit '2' was made in 1961 and 
												Exhibit '4' made in 1980&quot;. 
												(emphasis supplied)</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The judgment as could be seen, 
												left a lot of issues 
												undetermined. The trial judge 
												based his judgment on recent 
												acts of possession and/or 
												ownership. He relied on Exhibit 
												'A&#8217;, a settlement by one Sakyi 
												Appiah as estoppel. It was not 
												clear whether it was a 
												settlement or arbitration but 
												the Court of Appeal did not 
												accept Exhibit 'A' as creating 
												any estoppel of title in respect 
												of the land the subject-matter 
												of the present litigation.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There is no doubt however that 
												the evidence led by the 
												plaintiff to establish his title 
												to the land was preferable. The 
												plaintiff called his boundary 
												owners to testify.&nbsp; Both the 
												trial court and the Court of 
												Appeal accepted the evidence.&nbsp; 
												By whatever description or name 
												the defendant referred to his 
												land, it was clear that that 
												land was part of the whole land 
												of the plaintiff called MPREBUA. 
												The plaintiff was therefore 
												entitled to a declaration of 
												title.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Court of Appeal vested the 
												plaintiff with the paramount or 
												allodial title in the land.&nbsp; 
												This, we believe flowed from the 
												fact that there was evidence of 
												long undisturbed occupation by 
												the defendant&#8217;s family or 
												tenants on the land.&nbsp; Since the 
												parties restricted their case to 
												the larger land in dispute, and 
												the trial judge had not made any 
												findings on who had occupied 
												which part of the land and for 
												how long, it became difficult to 
												identify the areas so occupied 
												exclusively with or without 
												permission from this plaintiff&#8217;s 
												family. This made the 
												declaration of a usufructuary 
												title in the defendant's 
												unsatisfactory. The order for a 
												fresh plan to identify these 
												areas was bound to create more 
												problems and start fresh 
												litigation. We feel therefore 
												that for a proper identification 
												of these areas, fresh evidence 
												is needed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												We would dismiss the appeal in 
												so far as it relates to title to 
												the land but order that the case 
												be sent back to the trial court 
												for fresh evidence to be taken 
												to identify the areas which 
												either by themselves or their 
												family members or tenants the 
												parties have occupied 
												undisturbed, and for how long.</span></p>
