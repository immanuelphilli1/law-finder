												In the case of RUSSEL VRS. EAST 
												ANGLIAN RAILWAY CO. (1850) 42 
												E.R. 201 Truro, L.C. at page 206 
												delivered himself thus:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;I have looked with care through 
												the very numerous authorities 
												that have been cited, but it is 
												not necessary for me to go 
												through them. The result appears 
												to be this, that it is an 
												established rule of this Court 
												that it is&nbsp; not open to any 
												party to question the orders of 
												this Court, or any process 
												issued under the authority of 
												this Court, by disobedience. I 
												know of no act which this Court 
												may do, which may not be 
												questioned in a proper forum, 
												and on a proper application; but 
												I am of the opinion that it is 
												not competent for anyone to 
												interfere with the possession of 
												a receiver, or to disobey an 
												injunction or any other order of 
												the Court, on the ground that 
												such orders were improvidently 
												made. Parties must take a proper 
												course to question their 
												validity, but while they exist 
												they must be obeyed. I consider 
												the rule to be of such 
												importance to the interest of 
												and safety of the public, and to 
												the due administration of 
												justice, that it ought, on all 
												occasions, to be inflexibly 
												maintained. I do not see how the 
												Court can expect its officers to 
												do their duty, if they do it 
												under the peril of resistance, 
												and of that resistance being 
												justified on grounds tending to 
												the impeachment of the order 
												under which they are acting&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The above dictum is given 
												prominence in this ruling not 
												only because of its relevance 
												but also because it adequately 
												expresses our views on the 
												applicable law in the instant 
												case. The facts in RUSSEL VRS 
												EAST ANGLIAN RAILWAY CO. (supra) 
												are that property in possession 
												of a receiver and manager 
												appointed by the Court in a suit 
												was seized by the Sheriff under 
												a writ of fi-fa. The order 
												appointing the receiver ought 
												not to have been made in the 
												first case. Contempt proceedings 
												were initiated against the 
												Sheriff for disturbing the 
												possession of the receiver and 
												manager. It was contended on 
												behalf of the Sheriff that where 
												the order for the appointment of 
												a receiver ought not to have 
												been made, the Court should not, 
												in the exercise of its 
												discretion, commit the Sheriff 
												for interfering with the 
												possession of the receiver. This 
												argument prompted the Lord 
												Chancellor to deliver the above 
												quoted dictum.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The facts of the instant case 
												are that the Applicants 
												(hereinafter referred to as the 
												Defendants) had judgment entered 
												against them in the Circuit 
												Court on the 21st of October, 
												1999. The Court ordered them to 
												give up possession of a house to 
												the Interested Parties in these 
												proceedings (hereinafter 
												referred to as the Plaintiffs). 
												The Defendants, dissatisfied 
												with the judgment and 
												consequential orders, filed an 
												appeal to the Court of Appeal on 
												the 28th day of October, 1999 
												and then followed this with an 
												application for stay of 
												execution pending an appeal. 
												This application was filed on 
												29th October, 1999. Meanwhile, 
												the Plaintiffs, also on the same 
												day, applied ex-parte, for a 
												writ of possession to enable 
												them recover possession of the 
												house as decreed in the 
												judgment. Pursuant to the writ 
												for recovery of possession, the 
												Deputy Sheriff effected the 
												ejectment of the Defendants. But 
												believing, to use their own 
												words, that &quot;the exercise was 
												unlawful as having been carried 
												out when the motion for stay of 
												execution pending appeal... had 
												not been heard&quot; the Defendants 
												adopted self-help and reinstated 
												themselves in the house from 
												which they had earlier been 
												ejected by the Deputy Sheriff. 
												The Plaintiff then cited the 
												Defendants in the High Court for 
												contempt.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The High Court found the 
												Defendants guilty but adjourned 
												to two weeks for sentence. 
												Though it is not clear from the 
												record, we feel this adjournment 
												could have been intended to give 
												the Defendants a chance to purge 
												themselves. However they rather 
												chose to apply to this Court for 
												an order of certiorari and 
												prohibition to first quash the 
												ruling of the High Court dated 
												10th July, 2000 convicting them 
												of contempt and secondly to 
												prohibit the said Court from 
												proceeding to sentence them. The 
												ground urged on behalf of this 
												application was that there was 
												an error of law apparent on the 
												face of the record. The error 
												cited was that the writ of 
												recovery of possession ought not 
												to have been made in view of the 
												pendency of the motion for stay 
												of execution pending appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This Court, after reading the 
												relevant papers filed in 
												accordance with our Rules, and 
												listening to both Counsel in 
												Court, summarily&nbsp; dismissed the&nbsp; 
												application for certiorari and 
												prohibition. The present ruling 
												relates to an application for a 
												review of our previous decision. 
												The grounds canvassed now are 
												not different from those urged 
												upon us in the original motion. 
												The issue then, and now, is 
												whether a party to a suit, or a 
												person to whom an order of a 
												court of competent jurisdiction 
												is directed can justify his 
												disobedience on grounds that the 
												order or process is null and 
												void, or erroneous, or 
												improvidently made?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In our decision of 14th 
												November, 2000, we answered this 
												question in the negative. The 
												same legal arguments are being 
												made to us to induce a review of 
												our original decision. We would 
												have adopted a similar approach 
												and summarily dismiss the 
												present application for a review 
												but for what we consider to be 
												the need for this Court to speak 
												loudly and clearly on this issue 
												for parties and their lawyers 
												alike to take note.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Those who are prone to giving an 
												affirmative answer to the legal 
												questions whether the invalidity 
												of an order, or a process can be 
												a justification for its 
												disobedience or not, often base 
												their position on certain dicta 
												in MCFOY VRS. U.A.C. (1962) A.C. 
												152 and MOSI VRS. BAGYINA (1963) 
												1 G.L.R. 337.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the former case, Lord Denning 
												said of void orders:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;If an act is void, then it is 
												in law a nullity. It is not only 
												bad, but incurably bad. There is 
												no need for an order of the 
												Court to set it aside. It is 
												automatically null and void 
												without more ado, though it is 
												sometimes convenient to have the 
												Court declare it to be so. And 
												any proceeding which is founded 
												on it is also bad and incurably 
												bad. You cannot put something on 
												nothing and expect it to stay 
												there. It will collapse&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Although Lord Denning could be 
												taken to have been categorical 
												on stating that when an order or 
												a process is void &quot;there is no 
												need for an order of the Court 
												to set it aside&quot;, he 
												nevertheless had an inhibition 
												or diffidence that in certain 
												circumstances it would be 
												&quot;convenient to have the Court 
												declare it to be so&quot;. 
												Unfortunately, he did not 
												indicate those circumstances; 
												neither did he indicate those 
												situations when it would be 
												inconvenient or hazardous to a 
												party not to have it set aside. 
												Or was he thinking only about 
												the effect of the said order or 
												judgment in a subsequent 
												litigation between the same 
												parties or their privies? We do 
												not see anything in the dictum 
												of Lord Denning which suggests 
												to, or positively encourages, a 
												party to disobey an order 
												considered or perceived by him 
												to be void, or erroneous and 
												justify the said disobedience on 
												that ground; nor do we find 
												anything to suggest that an 
												irregular or void process can be 
												resisted on that ground or 
												impeached through disobedience.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												And in the MOSI VRS. BAGYINA 
												case, Akufo-Addo, J.S.C. (as he 
												then was) said of void decisions 
												at page 342:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The law, as I have always 
												understood it, is where a Court 
												or a judge gives judgment or 
												makes an order which it has no 
												jurisdiction to give or make or 
												which is irregular because it is 
												not warranted by any enactment 
												or rule of procedure, such a 
												judgment or order is void, and 
												the Court has an inherent 
												jurisdiction, either suo motu or 
												on the application of the party 
												affected, to set aside the 
												judgment or the order.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												After reviewing some cases he 
												delivered himself at page 347 as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;(1) where a judgment or order 
												is void either because it is 
												given or made without 
												jurisdiction or because it is 
												not warranted by any law or rule 
												or procedure, the party affected 
												is entitled ex debito justitiae 
												to have it set aside, and the 
												Court or judge is under a legal 
												obligation to set it aside. No 
												judicial discretion arises 
												here...</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) There is no time limit in 
												which the party affected by a 
												void order or judgment may apply 
												to have it set aside.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Again, there is nothing in these 
												dicta of Akufo-Addo in the MOSI 
												VRS. BAGYINA case which 
												recommends or encourages 
												disobedience of an order which 
												is void. Although it is true to 
												say that it is clear from the 
												two authorities, MOSI VRS. 
												BAGYINA (supra) and MCFOY VRS. 
												U.A.C. (supra) that if a 
												tribunal wrongly assumes 
												jurisdiction, the party who 
												apparently obtains an order from 
												it, in reality gets nothing, the 
												whole proceeding being CORAM NON 
												JUDICE, it is worthy to note 
												that these authorities also 
												emphasise the need to have the 
												order, which is described as 
												&quot;incurably bad&quot;, set aside.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Sowah, C.J. in case of KUMNIPAH 
												VRS. AYIREBI (1987 - 88) 1 
												G.L.R. 265 at page 270 observed:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;It has often been said that 
												when an act is a nullity there 
												is no need for a Court to 
												declare it to be so or set it 
												aside. That may well be so, but 
												when a judgment appears to be 
												regular on the face of it and 
												nothing therein indicates that 
												it is a nullity, it is in my 
												view, foolhardiness for a party 
												to ignore it and do nothing.&quot;</span></p>

												VRS. BREW (1992) 1 G.L.R. 14 the 
												relevant principle was stated in 
												holding three as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;It is an established rule that 
												an order of a Court of competent 
												jurisdiction whether considered 
												erroneous, illegal, indiscrete 
												or irregular had to be obeyed. 
												Accordingly, non-compliance with 
												an order which amounted to 
												contempt of Court could not be 
												justified on the ground that the 
												said order was irregularly made 
												or bad in law. The proper thing 
												for the aggrieved party to do 
												was to question the order in the 
												proper forum by a proper 
												application. Accordingly, the 
												Defendant could not justify her 
												wilful contempt by her 
												contention that the order was 
												erroneous and therefore her 
												appeal against the interim 
												injunction had a good chance of 
												succeeding.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												We whole-heartedly endorse the 
												principle as stated above and 
												consequently reiterate the law 
												to be: the fact that an order 
												of, or a process from, a Court 
												of Competent jurisdiction is 
												perceived and considered void or 
												erroneous should not give a 
												party who is affected by the 
												order, or to whom the process is 
												directed, the slightest 
												encouragement to disobey it; and 
												when cited for contempt, only to 
												turn round to justify the said 
												disobedience by the fact that 
												the order ought not to have been 
												made or the process issued in 
												the first place. The proper 
												thing to do is to either obey, 
												or sue for a declaration to that 
												effect or apply to have it set 
												aside. The proponent of the 
												order then assumes the burden to 
												justify the order on which he 
												relies and so prove that the 
												order or the process was not 
												improvidently made. As a matter 
												of public policy it is important 
												that the authority of the Court 
												and the sanctity of its process 
												and orders be maintained at all 
												times. It is too dangerous to 
												give to a litigant and his 
												Counsel the right to decide 
												which orders or process of the 
												Court are lawful and therefore 
												deserving of obedience, and if 
												not, must be disobeyed. An order 
												or process of a Court of 
												competent jurisdiction cannot be 
												impeached by disobedience. That 
												way, we would needlessly be 
												empowering lawyers, in their 
												various chambers, to have 
												supervisory jurisdiction over 
												the Courts. That is an effective 
												way to undermine, if not 
												destroy, the administration of 
												justice. The application for a 
												review will therefore be 
												dismissed and it is hereby 
												dismissed.</span></p>

												ADZOE, J.S.C.:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In concurrence with my brothers, 
												I wish to add this: I came upon 
												a statement made by Annan J.A. 
												in his judgment in the case of 
												Baah v. Baah (1973) 2 GLR 8. At 
												page 13 of the report, the 
												learned judge observed:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Whatever be the merits or 
												demerits of that order, and I 
												make no comment of any 
												description on that matter, that 
												order stands and has not been 
												set aside. It does not on the 
												face of it appear to be void ab 
												initio and effect therefore has 
												to be given to it until it is 
												set aside or otherwise 
												vitiated&quot;. (The emphasis is 
												mine).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It reminds me of a similar 
												statement made by Justice 
												Stewart of the Alabama Supreme 
												Court when he delivered the 
												opinion of the Court in Walker 
												v. City of Birmingham 388 US 
												301. He said at page 315</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Without question the state 
												court that issued the injunction 
												had, as a court of equity, 
												jurisdiction over the 
												petitioners and over the subject 
												matter of the controversy. And 
												this is not a case where the 
												injunction was transparently 
												invalid or had only a frivolous 
												pretence to validity&quot;. (The 
												emphasis is mine).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It cannot be denied that these 
												two opinions appear to suggest 
												that if an order were &quot;void ab 
												initio&quot; or if it were 
												&quot;transparently invalid&quot; it could 
												be disobeyed with impunity. But 
												the rule that such an order 
												cannot be disobeyed is now 
												firmly established by a long 
												line of authorities. And I hope 
												that the veiled impression 
												created by the statements I have 
												quoted above that a party could 
												elect to disobey a court order 
												or process if he forms the 
												opinion that the order or 
												process is void or irregular 
												must be deemed to have been 
												effectually eroded by today's 
												judgment. No litigant has the 
												right to determine for himself 
												whether or not a court order is 
												valid to command his obedience 
												to it. Compliance with the 
												orders of the Court is the only 
												sure route to public order and 
												peace which we need to sustain a 
												stable democratic social order.</span></p>
