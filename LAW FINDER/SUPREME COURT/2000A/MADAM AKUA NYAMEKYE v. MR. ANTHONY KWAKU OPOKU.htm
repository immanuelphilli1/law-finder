												RULING</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												EDWARD WIREDU, J.S.C.:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is an application praying 
												this Court to review its 
												judgement given on July 17th, 
												1999 dismissing the Applicant's 
												appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												When Rule 54 of the Supreme 
												Court Rules, 1996 (C.I. 16) was 
												enacted, it was the hope of all 
												that having spelt out, in 
												statutory terms, the only 
												grounds upon which the review 
												jurisdiction of this Court may 
												be exercised, litigants would be 
												duly guided thereby and the 
												previous attempts to use the 
												review jurisdiction as an avenue 
												for a rehearing of lost appeals 
												would cease or, at least, be 
												significantly reduced. 
												Unfortunately this does not 
												appear to be the effect. To make 
												matters worse, it also appears 
												that counsel for losing parties 
												are under the misapprehension 
												that the 'reviewability' of a 
												matter is determined by 
												numerical factors and any 
												decision of the court which is 
												not unanimous must be subject to 
												review.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Illustrative of this point is 
												the statement in the Applicant's 
												Statement of Case herein that 
												the application is for:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;... review of the split 
												decision of the Supreme Court 
												... by a majority of 3-2 ... 
												(and that in this matter) 
												Except... in the National House 
												of Chief where the decision was 
												unanimous in all the other 
												adjudicating bodies which have 
												dealt with this case the 
												decisions have been split, 
												meaning therefore that there may 
												well be very good reasons for 
												reviewing the majority decision 
												of the Supreme Court...&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I will however, reiterate, by 
												way of a reminder, the words of 
												Taylor, J.S.C. in Bisi vrs. 
												Kwayie [1987-88] 2 GLR 295 at 
												297 that:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;In our system of adjudication, 
												the majority view of a plural 
												bench of a court represents the 
												binding judgment of the court, 
												even if it can be subsequently 
												demonstrated to be vulnerable to 
												attacks.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												By virtue of Rule 54 (supra), in 
												an application for review, what 
												is in issue is, not a matter of 
												headcount, otherwise, why not 
												count all the way from the trial 
												court/tribunal, up to the 
												Supreme Court, to ascertain what 
												should be the right decision. 
												Rather, the only matters this 
												Court is permitted by the law to 
												take into account in a review 
												application are those that 
												demonstrably show that there are</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) exceptional circumstances 
												which have resulted in a 
												miscarriage of justice to the 
												Applicant; or&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) there is some new matter or 
												evidence that have come to light 
												after the decision, which, will 
												all due diligence, had not been 
												within the Applicant's knowledge 
												or could not have been produced 
												by him earlier.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This special jurisdiction of the 
												court will not, cannot and must 
												not, therefore, be exercised 
												merely because counsel for the 
												Applicant refines his appellate 
												statement of case, or thinks up 
												more ingenious arguments, which, 
												he believes, might have favoured 
												the Applicant had they been so 
												presented in the appeal hearing. 
												An opportunity for a second bite 
												at the cherry is not the purpose 
												for which this Court was given 
												the power of review. In the case 
												of Quartey et als. vrs. Central 
												Services Co. Ltd. et als. 
												[1996-97] SGGLR 398 Abban, C.J., 
												at page 399, explained the 
												review jurisdiction of this 
												Court in the following terms:-</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;A review of a judgement is a 
												special jurisdiction and not an 
												appellate jurisdiction conferred 
												on the court; and the court 
												would exercise that special 
												jurisdiction in favour of an 
												applicant only in exceptional 
												circumstances. This implies that 
												such an applicant should satisfy 
												the court that there has been 
												some fundamental or basic error 
												which the court inadvertently 
												committed in the course of 
												considering its judgment; and 
												which fundamental error has 
												thereby resulted in a gross 
												miscarriage of justice. These 
												principles have been stated over 
												and over again by this court. 
												Consequently a losing party is 
												not entitled to use the process 
												to prevail upon the court to 
												have another or a second look at 
												his case.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Although this decision, and the 
												greater number of decisions 
												which sought to define the 
												principles upon which this Court 
												will exercise the review 
												jurisdiction, predate the 
												enactment of Rule 54, there is 
												no doubt that the Rule itself is 
												an encapsulation of these 
												principles and the earlier 
												learning still holds good in 
												determining whether an 
												application is one worthy of the 
												exercise of this special 
												jurisdiction.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Thus Rule 56 of C.I. 16 requires 
												the Applicant's affidavit and 
												statement of case to set out 
												clearly and argue fully all 
												relevant grounds on which the 
												Applicant relies. This 
												requirement means that rather 
												than a mere recitation of one of 
												the grounds stipulated in Rule 
												54, the Applicant must specify 
												the attendant circumstances 
												which would necessarily and 
												prima facie place their case for 
												review under one of those 
												grounds. A mere repetition of 
												appeal arguments is, therefore, 
												not enough. Furthermore, as was 
												pointed out by Adade, J.S.C. in 
												Ribeiro vrs. Ribeiro (No. 2) 
												[1989-90] 2 GLR 130, &#8220;small 
												pinpricks here and there are not 
												enough.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Having closely examined the 
												affidavit in support of the 
												present application, as well as 
												the two Statements of Case filed 
												on behalf of the Applicant, it 
												is clear that the ground upon 
												which we are being invited to 
												review the decision of the 
												ordinary bench of the Court is 
												that there are exceptional 
												circumstances, which have 
												resulted in a miscarriage of 
												justice.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Although there can never be an 
												exhaustive list of what 
												situations would constitute 
												exceptional circumstances, the 
												criteria suggested by Taylor, 
												J.S.C. in Mechanical Lloyd 
												Assembly Plant vrs. Nartey 
												[1987-88] 2 GLR 598 continue to 
												provide a useful guideline as to 
												the classes of situations 
												envisaged under Rule 54 (a). At 
												page 638 of the report, his 
												Lordship suggested, inter alia, 
												as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Another circumstance is the one 
												falling within the principle ... 
												so ably enunciated by that 
												pillar of legality, Akuffo-Addo, 
												C.J. in Mosi vrs Bagyina [1963] 
												1 GLR 337. A third circumstance 
												comes within the class of cases 
												which can legitimately be said 
												to be decisions given per 
												incuriam for failure to consider 
												a statute or case law or 
												fundamental principle of 
												procedure and practice relevant 
												to the decision and which would 
												have resulted in a different 
												decision. A fourth class of case 
												must fall within the 
												constitutional mandate ... by 
												which we were enjoined to depart 
												from our previous decisions when 
												it appears right so to do. This 
												must be a sort of omnibus 
												criterion covering all other 
												cases not falling within the 
												three classes I have itemised, 
												for in the numerous conditions 
												governing human relationship it 
												is impossible to formulate a 
												prior propositions that will 
												cover all cases without 
												exception.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												See also the opinion of Kpegah, 
												J.S.C. in Kwa Nana vrs. Appa et 
												al. (unreported) SC judgment 
												dated 29th January, 1997 
												(digested in 1998 1 GQLJ 12).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is, therefore, incumbent upon 
												the Applicant to demonstrate 
												that there has been 'some 
												fundamental or basic error, 
												which the court inadvertently 
												committed in the course of 
												considering its judgement.' 
												However, this is not all, the 
												Applicant must additionally 
												demonstrate that as a result of 
												such fundamental or basic error, 
												her substantial rights in the 
												matter have been or likely to be 
												so prejudiced that the interest 
												of justice and good conscience 
												dictate that we take a second 
												look at the judgment complained 
												of. (See also the majority 
												ruling in the Republic vrs. Nana 
												Oduro Numapau II, &amp; 15 Ors., 
												Ex-Parte: Nana Adu Ameyaw II, 
												C.M. 39/99, dated 12th January, 
												2000 (S.C. unreported) as well 
												as the earlier decisions cited 
												therein).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The crux of the Applicant's case 
												in support of this application, 
												after eliminating the tedious 
												repetition of her case on 
												appeal, may be discerned from 
												paragraphs 3, 4 and 11 of the 
												affidavit in support of the 
												application, which may be 
												summarised as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												1. the decision dismissing the 
												appeal is entirely wrong and so 
												out of harmony with the basic 
												notions of clanship and 
												customary right to stool 
												occupancy among Akans that it 
												amounts to a miscarriage of 
												justice since it will make it 
												possible for three separate 
												clans and families, to aspire to 
												the Krobo Stool.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2.&nbsp; the decision of the court is 
												so dangerous and intolerable 
												that it will make it impossible, 
												in future, to decide who should 
												occupy the Krobo Stool.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3.&nbsp; by Akan customary law, a 
												Stool is created for only one 
												family and therefore the right 
												of occupancy is the exclusive 
												preserve of members of that 
												family alone.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Counsel for the Applicant filed 
												a statement of case wherein all 
												he did was rehash the matters 
												that he had raised in the appeal 
												regarding the failure of the 
												Respondent's evidence to support 
												his case.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The supplementary Statement of 
												Case subsequently filed by said 
												counsel, is in the main, merely 
												further expatiation on old 
												matters. Counsel's contentions 
												were that:&#8212;</span></p>

												the Stool kinship with whom is 
												claimed by both the Applicant 
												and the Respondent) resolve the 
												conflicting traditions in favour 
												of the Applicant since from that 
												time, it was members of the 
												Applicant's family that has 
												occupied both the male and 
												female stools of Krobo.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2. the majority's reliance on 
												the installation of S.K. Mainoo 
												on the Krobo Stool is misplaced 
												since he was an Ekuona man and 
												since the accession of Mainoo to 
												the Stool did not evoke any 
												dispute in the course of which 
												the tradition espoused by the 
												Respondent was invoked, 
												challenged and adjudicated upon 
												the Respondent cannot rely upon 
												Mainoo's installation to support 
												his eligibility to the Stool.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3. since the Respondent did not 
												claim an exclusive entitlement 
												for the Akyem Asona and the 
												Ekuona families, the majority 
												placed undue reliance on how 
												Krobo was founded because this 
												was an irrelevant issue in the 
												case.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												4. the majority did not give due 
												consideration to the 
												significance of the customary 
												name of the Stool.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												5. the traditional evidence 
												given by the Respondent was 
												unreasonable, intrinsically 
												flawed and unacceptable, 
												therefore, 'any recent act which 
												is consistent with it must be 
												due to a freak.'</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												With all due respect to counsel, 
												none of these points raise any 
												matters that demonstrate 
												exceptional circumstances. The 
												matter before the ordinary bench 
												of the court was an appeal from 
												a decision of the National House 
												of Chiefs. These are all points 
												that had been covered at every 
												stage of the litigation. 
												Essentially, the appeal before 
												the ordinary bench was an appeal 
												on the facts. As such, 
												therefore, the court's 
												fundamental duty was to test the 
												conclusions of Nananom against 
												the totality of the record and 
												ascertain whether the evidence 
												supported those conclusions. The 
												record amply supported the 
												findings of fact made or 
												confirmed by the National House 
												of Chiefs. The most cursory look 
												at the opinions delivered by 
												Adjabeng, Atuguba and Akuffo, 
												JJ.S.C., reveals quite clearly 
												that this is the approach they 
												applied. Not only did they 
												consider the testimony given by 
												the witnesses in the trial 
												tribunal, but also they tested, 
												in each case, the conclusions 
												arrived at by each of the 
												intervening appellate tribunals.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The mere fact that an appeal is 
												by way of a rehearsing does not 
												dictate that an appellate Court 
												is bound to re-evaluate the 
												evidence and re-assign different 
												weight to it, unless there are 
												pressing circumstances that 
												would justify such a course. 
												(See Ababio vrs. Bekoe II 
												[1996-97] SCGLR, 392 Adam Achoro 
												vrs. Akanfela [1996-97] SCGLR 
												384). There were no such 
												compelling reasons in the appeal 
												that came before the court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The only new nuance introduced 
												by the Supplementary Statement 
												of Case was the contention that, 
												even if the Respondent's family 
												and the Ekuona family had once 
												been eligible to the Krobo 
												Stool, after the death of Osei 
												Sampam, the Respondent's 
												family's dynasty was displaced 
												by the right acquired by the 
												Applicant's family to occupy the 
												Stool, which right they 
												exercised continuously up to 
												Osei Kufour. Thus, according to 
												counsel:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The evidence as it stands in 
												this case, shows that the 
												dynasty which existed up to Osei 
												Sampam's death was replaced by 
												the dynasty of the Applicant's 
												family and that unless there is 
												strong evidence to the contrary 
												the right of the Respondent's 
												family members to occupy the 
												Krobo Stool has become extant.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												One fails to appreciate how such 
												an argument advances the 
												application herein, nor the 
												manner in which it demonstrates 
												the existence of exceptional 
												circumstances that have resulted 
												in a miscarriage of justice to 
												the Applicant. A Statement of 
												Case in support of an 
												application for review is 
												certainly not the appropriate 
												occasion for rehearing such an 
												argument. In any event, the very 
												fact that, as is demonstrated by 
												the evidence:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												a) S.K. Mainoo, a member of the 
												'extant' Ekuona family was 
												installed as Krobohene after the 
												abdication of Nana Osei Kufour,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												b) at all material times within 
												living memory, Alhaji Kru, also 
												a member of the latter family 
												functioned as the Abusuapanin of 
												the entire Krobo Stool family, 
												and</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												c) the Applicant's predecessor, 
												as Obaapanin who was presumed to 
												know her royals, accepted 
												dwantoa from the Respondent in 
												his bid for the Stool, which 
												dwantoa was shared amongst the 
												kingmakers (a piece of evidence 
												which was never challenged by 
												the Applicant or any of her 
												witnesses)</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												effectively debunks this concept 
												of an extant dynasty.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Furthermore, at all material 
												points in the litigation, the 
												Respondent's case was that as a 
												member of the Akyem-Asona family 
												of Krobo he was eligible to the 
												Stool and had been duly 
												nominated and elected as such. 
												The Applicant's case was that 
												since the foundation of Krobo, 
												the Stool had been the exclusive 
												preserve of her Beposo-Asona 
												family. How then can she, in an 
												application for review, be 
												permitted to put up such a new 
												case?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In conclusion, although the 
												Applicant had made a valiant 
												effort to reargue her appeal in 
												this application, she has 
												woefully failed to demonstrate 
												any exceptional circumstance, 
												let alone one that has resulted 
												in a substantial miscarriage of 
												justice such as, together, would 
												justify the granting of her 
												application in accordance with 
												the rules of this Court. The 
												application must, therefore, be 
												dismissed for being entirely 
												without any merit whatsoever.</span></p>

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The institution of Chieftaincy 
												is itself a traditional 
												institution, and constitutes the 
												social and political foundation 
												of the particular community. 
												Thus when a Chieftaincy dispute 
												arises,, it is always essential 
												that, at least for the sake of 
												stability within the community, 
												a solution is sought which is 
												anchored firmly in the 
												traditions of that Stool, and 
												which respects those traditions. 
												A solution which flies in the 
												face of the tradition and is 
												seen glaringly to contradict it, 
												is not likely to be acceptable 
												to the community, and creates a 
												recipe for dissatisfaction, 
												disaffection and dissentions, 
												and, at least provocation, civil 
												strife and conflicts. Thus in 
												all these cases every effort 
												must be made to ascertain what 
												the tradition of the stool is. 
												Where the parties broadly agree 
												on the tradition, this must form 
												the decision of the Court. Where 
												they do not agree, as where the 
												traditional accounts are widely 
												and wildly divergent or where 
												the traditional history is lost 
												in the murky corridors of time, 
												then recourse may be had to 
												practices within relatively 
												recent times to determine what 
												the tradition probably is.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As stated later in this my

												anything to do with this matter, 
												agree that the issues involved 
												are mainly customary. It is 
												therefore necessary that for the 
												sake of stability within the 
												community concerned a solution 
												be sought which is anchored 
												firmly in the traditions of that

												(1)&nbsp; Who first settled at Krobo</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">

												or without his overlord's 
												knowledge and consent.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(4) Who customarily was entitled 
												to create a Stool for a

												overlord Chief or the caretaker 
												of the land and the sub Chief of 
												the overlord Chief.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(5) What was the name of the 
												Stool created for the Krobos.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(6) What was the custom 
												concerning the naming of a newly 
												created Stool.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(7) How many black Stools were 
												in the Stool room of the Krobos. 
												How many belonged to each 
												claimant. How is this proved.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(8) How many Queenmothers had 
												the Stool had?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(9) Could a Stool be created for 
												two different families - would 
												that be a patrilineal Stool or

												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(10) The Krobo Odikro who 
												created the Krobo Benkum Stool 
												was he an Asona? If so is he 
												from the Plaintiff's Asona or 
												from the Defendant's Asona.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">

												The Kumasi Traditional Council 
												by a majority of 2 to 1 upheld 
												the claim by the Defendants and 
												dismissed the Plaintiffs claim. 
												The Ashanti Regional House of 
												Chiefs by a majority of 2 to 1 
												allowed an appeal filed by the 
												Plaintiff, thus accepting her 
												claim. The National House of 
												Chiefs however allowed the 
												Defendant's subsequent appeal 
												and restored the decision of the 
												Traditional Council. It is worth 
												noting that both the Traditional 
												Council and the Regional House

												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Having set down the opinions and

												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;We have listened to both

												only consider their weight and

												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It then proceeded to evaluate 
												the evidence thus,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">

												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Judging from what custom, one 
												may ask? As stated clearly by 
												the tribunals, the issues 
												involved in this case were the 
												determination of the relevant 
												customary law and practices 
												pertaining to this particular 
												community. It has been the 
												complaint of the applicant that 
												the judgment was given without 
												regard for the established 
												principles of customary law and 
												practices.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There was clear evidence from 
												the Antoahene as to how the 
												Beposo Asona group had settled 
												on the land and how he had 
												created a Stool for them. The 
												question as to whether or not 
												being Ashantis, the Beposo 
												Asonas could have migrated to 
												another part of Ashanti was of 
												no consequence as it is 
												undeniable that whether they 
												migrated against custom or not 
												their claim to the Krobo Stool 
												has been admitted by their 
												opponents. And, they have been 
												elevated to the 'Akwamu' status 
												which significantly, they 
												claimed to have occupied when 
												they were at Beposo. Was it for 
												no reason or purpose that they 
												were raised to that status?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The National House of Chiefs had 
												accepted the version of the 
												defendant with regard to the 
												settlement on the land and had 
												reasoned,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The appellant's version of 
												migration having been accepted, 
												it follows that they arrived 
												earlier than the respondent&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It continued,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;It follows that the appellants 
												might have settled before the 
												arrival of the respondents.&quot; 
												(emphasis supplied).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Despite accepting the version of 
												the defendant, the House was not 
												certain that the position was 
												so! There was no doubt that the 
												land on which the plaintiffs 
												family settled belonged to the 
												Antoahene. It was he who ordered 
												his Krontihene (P.W.1) to settle 
												the plaintiff's family on the 
												land. The Adesinahene was a 
												caretaker of the land for the 
												Antoahene and if he (the 
												Adesinahene) had earlier settled 
												some strangers on the land, it 
												was a customary requirement that 
												his overlord (the Antoahene) 
												should be informed. There was no 
												evidence to that effect.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The majority of the Regional 
												House of Chiefs was of the view 
												that the evidence that the 
												Adesinahene created the Krobo 
												Stool was contrary to custom. To 
												it the evidence of the Antoahene 
												was to be accorded credibility 
												and reliance on the founding and 
												creation of the said stool, as 
												the overlord of both Adesina and 
												Krobo. It observed,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;This view is based on the fact 
												that in Akan custom the occupant 
												of the Odikro Stool cannot 
												create an Odikro Stool.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Reliance on E.E. Obeng's 
												statement in his book and 
												Warrington's Notes was very 
												dangerous. How authoritative 
												were these authors? With the 
												direct evidence of the Antoahene, 
												the overlord, it is very 
												difficult to accept these 
												non-authoritative statements. In 
												any case, the issue of 
												migration, namely whether an 
												Ashanti could move from one part 
												of Ashanti to another changing 
												his allegiance, could not have 
												disqualified the plaintiffs 
												family from ascending the Krobo 
												Stool. It was therefore 
												irrelevant to the determination 
												of who owned the Krobo Stool. 
												Since the defendant's family 
												conceded that the plaintiffs 
												family was entitled to ascend 
												the Stool, the proper issue 
												which arose was whether the 
												defendant's family and for that 
												matter the other Asona family 
												from Adesina were also entitled 
												to ascend the Stool. The onus 
												was on the defendant. There was 
												no evidence that the Adesinahene 
												allegedly created the Krobo 
												Stool when he was elevated to 
												the status of Nifahene of Antoa. 
												Krobo itself was elevated to the 
												status of Akwamuhene of Antoa, a 
												position higher than that of 
												Adesinahene who claimed to have 
												created the Krobo Stool. As the 
												situation stood at the time of 
												the settlement of Krobo, 
												customarily, Adesinahene could 
												not have created a Stool equal 
												to his. This is the decision 
												arrived at by the Regional House 
												of Chiefs and which decision 
												accorded with custom. It was 
												therefore necessary for this 
												Court to re-examine the evidence 
												critically. This the Court 
												failed to do.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Court also accepted without 
												proof that the defendant's 
												family and the other Asona 
												Family had their ancestors' 
												stools kept in the Stool room. 
												That the plaintiffs family had 
												their ancestors' Stools in the 
												Stool room was not challenged. 
												The plaintiff however challenged 
												the assertion by the defendant. 
												It was therefore necessary that 
												some evidence capable of proof 
												be established. The Stools in 
												the Stool room could have been 
												inspected and counted in 
												accordance with custom. In 
												Majolagbe Vrs. Larbi (1959) GLR 
												190 the Court stated the 
												principle of law regarding such 
												proof thus,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Proof in law is the 
												establishment of facts by proper 
												legal means. Where a party makes 
												an averment capable of proof in 
												some positive way, say e.g. by 
												producing documents, description 
												of things, reference to other 
												facts instances or 
												circumstances, and his averment 
												is denied, he does not prove it 
												by merely going into the witness 
												box and repeating averment on 
												oath or having it repeated on 
												oath by his witness. He proves 
												it by producing other evidence 
												of facts and circumstances, from 
												which Court, can be satisfied 
												that what he avers is true.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Also, the plaintiff had said the 
												name of her Stool was 'Bensua' 
												(a corrupted version of Obeng 
												Asua) named after her first 
												ancestors. This was admitted by 
												the defendant. The Regional 
												House of Chiefs held this to be 
												the established custom. The 
												Traditional Council thought it 
												was possible to have a 
												&quot;different name&quot; other than the 
												founding ancestors'. The 
												National House of Chiefs only 
												accepted the finding by the 
												Traditional Council without 
												assigning any tangible reason 
												for the preference. It said,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;It is sometime named after 
												somebody who not being a founder 
												or first occupant but who after 
												its creation performs some 
												powers to enhance the dignity 
												and prestige of the Stool.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Was there any such evidence? The 
												National House of Chiefs was 
												trying to find a reason for the 
												defendant giving the Stool the 
												same name as the plaintiff. It 
												found it difficult to agree with 
												the Regional House of Chiefs' 
												restatement of the custom. It 
												said,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;We will not agree that it is a 
												hard and fast rule that a Stool 
												is named only after the founder 
												or first occupant. We would say 
												that is a rebuttable 
												presumption.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												And was it rebutted? In the 
												absence of any such evidence, 
												the custom as proven to exist 
												must prevail,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The tribunals also flouted the 
												established principle of law 
												that where the evidence of a 
												party supports the opponent's 
												then the opponent's evidence 
												must be accepted. The force of 
												corroborative evidence from an 
												opponent has long been enshrined 
												in cases like, Tsirfo V vrs. 
												Duah VIII (1959) GLR 63.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As stated above, without 
												positive proof that the 
												defendant's family had three of 
												its Stools in the Stool room, 
												the conclusion that,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;All these aside there is the 
												uncontroverted claim by the 
												appellants that they have three 
												Stools of their ancestors among 
												the Stools of Krobo Stools 
												belonging to Asonas of Akyem 
												origin and Ekuona. This fact is 
												the absence of any evidence that 
												Stool was created specifically 
												for patrilineal descent goes to 
												buttress the fact that both 
												Asona and Ekuona can ascend the 
												Krobo Stool from maternal line 
												and still supports the version 
												of the Appellants&quot;, </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												could not support the 
												conjectured customary law and 
												practice. In the first place 
												that evidence was challenged. 
												There was also positive evidence 
												that the Stool was created for 
												the Beposo Asona family. Thus, 
												while the Traditional Council 
												and the National House of Chiefs 
												were surmising as to what the 
												custom could be, the Regional 
												House of Chiefs was positive on 
												the custom. It stated in no 
												uncertain terms,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;That in Akan custom succession 
												to stools is invariably 
												matrilineal barring a few 
												exceptions. In that regard 
												granting that the Respondent's 
												version that the Krobo Stool was 
												created for the two friends, if 
												true the Stool ought to have 
												been a patrilineal Stool rather 
												than matrilineal as it obtains 
												now.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There is no evidence of 
												exceptional circumstances. This 
												Court only accepted the judgment 
												of the National House of Chiefs 
												without critically examining the 
												evidence as to the custom.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Yet still, even though the 
												plaintiffs family is said to 
												have been accepted into the Akim 
												families (Asona and Ekuona), 
												through Adoma or Animaa later, 
												of the eight (8) Chiefs who, 
												according to the defendant, had 
												ascended the Stool, four (4) of 
												them are admitted to have come 
												from the plaintiffs family. The 
												plaintiffs family however denied 
												that any member of the Akim 
												families had ever ascended the 
												Stool; it claimed that all the 
												six (6) Chiefs who had ascended 
												the Stool came from the 
												plaintiffs family. Again, out of 
												the five (5) women who were 
												alleged to have become 
												queenmothers, three (3) were 
												from the plaintiff's family. 
												From which family was Osei 
												Sampan? The evidence showed that 
												even though he was an Asona he 
												was of the plaintiff's Asona 
												Family. Thus from Nana Obeng Sua 
												whose name was given to the 
												Stool, all the subsequent 
												occupants of the Stool had come 
												from the plaintiff's family.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In its assessment or evaluation 
												of the evidence, the National 
												House of Chiefs came to the 
												conclusion that,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The only points in favour of 
												respondents are the custom 
												raised by Ashanti Regional House 
												of Chiefs and we hold the view 
												that the naming of the Stool 
												could be due to factors other 
												than the fact that it was named 
												after the one who founded it or 
												its first occupant. The evidence 
												yields itself to this conclusion 
												and we find it so.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What evidence yields itself to 
												this conclusion? This was a most 
												unsatisfactory way of concluding 
												on a custom which affects a 
												particular community. The 
												National House of Chiefs refused 
												to accept the plaintiffs 
												evidence on mere discrepancies 
												and contradictions which 
												appeared in the evidence of 
												P.W.1 and P.W.2 on the 
												historical aspect of the case. 
												But as observed by Lord Denning 
												in Adjeibi-Kojo vrs. Bonsie 
												(1957) 3 WALR 257 at page 260, 
												once traditional history is 
												handed down by word or mouth, it 
												must&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;....... be recognised that, in 
												the course of transmission from 
												generation to generation, 
												mistakes may occur without any 
												dishonest motives whatever. 
												Witnesses of the utmost veracity 
												may speak honestly but 
												erroneously as to what took 
												place a hundred years or more 
												ago.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A Court therefore should not 
												simply reject a party's 
												traditional evidence on such 
												petty and trifling matters.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Unfortunately the Supreme Court, 
												with respect, failed to look 
												critically at the customary law 
												and practice propounded by the 
												lower tribunals. It also dwelt 
												on the alleged conflicts and 
												discrepancies found by the lower 
												tribunals as a basis for 
												accepting the decision of the 
												National House of Chiefs. It 
												also failed to apply the 
												established legal principles 
												laid down for the evaluation of 
												the evidence. As it is, it left 
												the determination of the 
												customary law and practices 
												applicable to the community 
												concerned unresolved and thus 
												imposed on them an alien custom. 
												By so doing grave miscarriage of 
												justice was occasioned. I would 
												in the circumstances grant the 
												application and review the 
												judgment.</span></p>
