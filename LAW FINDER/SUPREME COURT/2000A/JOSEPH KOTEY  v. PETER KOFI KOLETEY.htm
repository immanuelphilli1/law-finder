												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is a motion for special 
												leave to a Appeal to the Supreme 
												Court under Article 131(2) of 
												the 1992 Constitution.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Appellate jurisdiction of 
												the Supreme Court can be found 
												in Article 131 clauses (1) and 2 
												thereof which provides as 
												follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Article 131.(1) An appeal shall 
												be from a Judgment of the Court 
												of Appeal to the supreme Court&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) as of right in a civil or 
												criminal cause or matter, in 
												respect of which an appeal has 
												been brought to the Court of 
												Appeal from a judgment of the 
												High Court or a Regional 
												Tribunal in the exercise of its 
												original jurisdiction; or</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) with leave of the Court of 
												Appeal, in any other cause or 
												matter, where the case was 
												commenced in a Court lower than 
												the High Court or a Regional 
												Tribunal and where the Court of 
												Appeal is satisfied that the 
												case involves a substantial 
												question of law or is in the 
												public interest.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) Notwithstanding clause (1) 
												of this Article the Supreme 
												Court may entertain an 
												application for special leave to 
												appeal to the Supreme Court in 
												any cause or matter, civil or 
												criminal, and may grant leave 
												accordingly.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The right of Appeal in Article 
												131(1)(a) is as of right but 
												that under (1)(b) requires leave 
												from the Court of Appeal. If 
												refused application could be 
												made for special leave under 
												Article 131(2). The application 
												for special leave where leave 
												has been refused by the Court of 
												Appeal is governed by Rule 7(2) 
												of C.I. 16. Rule 7(4) governs an 
												application for special leave 
												made straight to the Supreme 
												Court as permitted in Article 
												131(2) of the Constitution. 
												Whereas in the grant of special 
												leave under Rule 7(2) time limit 
												of 14 days was prescribed, that 
												under Rule 7(4) provides no time 
												limit:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Rule 7(4) states:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Notwithstanding sub rules (1) 
												to (3) of this rule an 
												application for special leave to 
												appeal under clause (2) of 
												Article 131 shall be entertained 
												by the court and the court may 
												grant leave on such terms as the 
												court may consider fit having 
												regard to the circumstances of 
												the case.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In this present case the 
												judgment of the Court of Appeal 
												against which appeal is sought 
												is dated 23rd December 1999 and 
												the applicant had 14 days 
												therefrom to apply to the Court 
												of Appeal for leave to appeal to 
												the Supreme Court under Rule 
												7(1) C.I. 16, since the case 
												commenced in the Circuit Court. 
												Applicant failed to apply for 
												leave to appeal within the 
												specified limitation period to 
												the Court of Appeal. According 
												to him his failure to comply, 
												with the rule was due to the 
												fact that he had to look for a 
												lawyer and then his lawyer first 
												applied to the Court of Appeal 
												for Stay of Execution which was 
												dismissed before realising that 
												Application should have been 
												made within 14 days which time 
												had by then already passed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It was after the dismissal of 
												the Stay of Execution that 
												Applicant's counsel realised 
												that he was out of time and 
												could not therefore apply for 
												leave under Rules 7(1) or 7(2) 
												as the time limited for applying 
												had expired. Since as was held 
												in Imbeah v. Ababio (2000) SC 
												GLR 259 the taking of a false 
												step by an applicant does not 
												prevent time from running 
												against him, the applicant had 
												no alternative than to availed 
												himself of Rule 7(4) of C.I. 16 
												which provided no time limit and 
												applied directly to this Court 
												for special leave to appeal. 
												According to Mr. Ahenkorah, 
												counsel for Applicant, not 
												having availed himself of Rules 
												7(1) and (2) he was entitled to 
												apply to the Supreme Court for 
												special leave under Rule 7(4) of 
												C.I. 1 6.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Mr. Awere for Respondent opposed 
												the application for special 
												leave on the grounds that where 
												the right of Appeal is given, 
												invariably time limit for 
												appealing is imposed, otherwise 
												a victorious party cannot 
												celebrate his victory. He 
												submitted that the time limit of 
												14 days within which to apply 
												for leave or special leave under 
												Rules 7(1) and (2) should apply 
												to also cases where leave is 
												sought under Rule 7(4) even 
												though no time limit was 
												specified under that rule, which 
												left the matter at large. The 
												special leave referred to by 
												Article 131(2) and Rule 7(4) 
												C.I. 16 is very special indeed 
												and it is also unfettered by any 
												rules or law since the grant of 
												leave was left entirely at the 
												discretion of the Supreme Court. 
												This leave is under S.4 (5) of 
												the Courts Act 1993 459 not 
												subject to any condition of 
												Appeal in the rules of Court 
												C.I. 16. It is a special favour 
												which is given to litigants who 
												have good and valid appeals to 
												enable them to appeal even 
												though they are under the rules 
												out of time within which to 
												appeal so as to prevent a 
												failure of justice. The 
												conditions and guidelines for 
												the grant of the said special 
												leave was discussed in the case 
												of Dolphyne (No.2) v. Speedline 
												Stevedoring Co. Ltd. (1996-97) 
												SC. GLR 373 where it was held 
												that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The provision in Article 131(2) 
												of the 1992 Constitution must 
												govern the provisions of Article 
												131(1)(a) and (b). The word 
												&quot;Notwithstanding in Article 
												131(2) meant that without being 
												affected by the provisions of 
												Article 131(1), the Supreme 
												Court might entertain an 
												application for special leave to 
												appeal in respect of appeals 
												from any decision or judgment of 
												the Court of Appeal and no other 
												court. Thus the Supreme Court 
												might in appropriate cases 
												ignore the provision of Article 
												131(1) and grant special leave 
												to appeal bearing in mind the 
												facts of each case and need to 
												prevent a failure of justice . . 
												. . . . . .&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Holding 2:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;In exercising its unfettered 
												discretion under Article 131(2) 
												of the 1992 Constitution the 
												Supreme Court was not bound by 
												any rules of practice or 
												procedure nor any legislation&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Holding 3:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The principles to be applied as 
												guides - on which the Supreme 
												Court might determine whether to 
												grant leave to appeal or not 
												were:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) where there was a prima 
												facie error on the face of the 
												record: or</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) a general principle of law 
												had arisen for the first time or</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(c) a decision by the Supreme 
												Court on the point sought to be 
												appealed against would be 
												advantageous to the public.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Nimoh v. Dadzie (1962) GLR 327 
												applied&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Dolphyne case did not 
												specify a time limit within 
												which an application for special 
												leave could be brought but as 
												stated by Charles 
												Hayfron-Benjamin J.S.C in his 
												dictum at p.378 of the report:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;This court being the highest 
												court of the land must 
												necessarily be vested with 
												unfettered discretion to do 
												justice in appropriate cases and 
												that is the true intendment of 
												Article 131(2) of the 1992 
												Constitution.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I agree with him on this. As I 
												understand holding (2) above, it 
												refers to the &quot;unfettered 
												discretion&quot; of the Supreme 
												Court, to grant special leave. 
												Since no conditions were imposed 
												under the rules and the matter 
												was left at large in Article 
												131(2) and Rule 7(4), the grant 
												of special leave is at the 
												discretion of the Court and not 
												fettered by any rules of 
												procedure or any law nor should 
												the court lay down a set of iron 
												rules &quot;on which the discretion 
												of the court was always obliged 
												to run.&quot; See the dictum of Bowen 
												L.J. in the English case of In 
												Re Manchester Economic Building 
												Society (1883) 24 Ch. D 488 at 
												503, which was quoted with 
												approval in the Dolphyne case 
												supra. Bowen L.J. stated:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot; . . . . . . . . . . . The 
												Rules leave the matter at large. 
												Of course it is to be exercised 
												in the way in which judicial 
												power and discretion ought to be 
												exercised, upon principles which 
												are well understood but which 
												had better not be defined in a 
												case except to far as may be 
												necessary for the decision of 
												that case - otherwise there is 
												great danger, as it seems to me, 
												of crystallizing into a rigid 
												definition that judicial power 
												and discretion which the 
												Legislature and Rules of the 
												Court have for the best of all 
												reasons left undetermined and 
												unfettered. If the Appellant is 
												asking for what is evidently 
												unjust it is clear that he ought 
												not to have it; if he is asking 
												for what may lead to injustice 
												he ought not have it except on 
												the terms which would prevent 
												any injustice possibly being 
												done, and for that reason, if 
												any of the Respondents here has 
												shewn that injustice was likely 
												to arise in their particular 
												case, I think terms ought to 
												have been imposed, but if the 
												person who is asking for leave 
												to appeal after twenty-one days 
												is only asking for what is just, 
												why should not he have it?&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The time within which an 
												application for special leave 
												under Rule 7(4) can be brought 
												as I said depends on the 
												discretion of the Supreme Court, 
												and the Court must also be 
												satisfied that the case involves 
												a substantial question of law or 
												is in the public interest. The 
												principles to be applied are as 
												set out in Holding 3 above in 
												the Dolphyne case supra. But 
												quite apart from the guidelines 
												provided in that case I hold the 
												view that the court's discretion 
												must be judicially and 
												reasonably exercised considering 
												such other matters as public 
												policy, and other principles 
												concerning the necessity for 
												finality in litigation as well 
												as the need for prevention of 
												delay in the administration of 
												justice. Bearing in mind that 
												inordinate delay in pursuing an 
												appeal could adversely affect 
												the acquired rights of other 
												parties with consequent 
												injustice to them. In Allen v. 
												Sir Alfred Mac Alpine and Sons 
												Ltd. (1968) 2 QB 299; 2 WLR 306 
												Court of Appeal at p.371 per 
												Lord Denning MR.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The principle upon which we go 
												is clear when the delay is 
												prolonged and inexcusable and is 
												such as to do grave injustice to 
												one side or the other or to 
												both, the court may in its 
												discretion dismiss the action 
												straight away leaving the 
												plaintiff to his remedy against 
												his own Solicitor who has 
												brought him to his plight&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As to the principle that 
												litigation must come to an end 
												Apaloo J. stated in the case of 
												Agyilihav v. Tayee (1975) 1 GLR 
												433 that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;In any event one should hold 
												that the conclusion of a case by 
												pronouncement of a decision must 
												exhaust the exercise of the 
												courts jurisdiction over the 
												eadem res. A court might not in 
												principle be held to have 
												perpetual jurisdiction over the 
												same matter.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is for this reason that 
												normally time limits are fixed 
												in rules governing court 
												procedures. Example is that in 
												granting extension of the time, 
												limitation is imposed and in 
												this regard see Rule 8 of C.I. 
												16 which provided that an appeal 
												cannot be filed within a total 
												of 6 months time limit from the 
												date of the decision sought to 
												be appealed. This is designed to 
												avoid delay in litigation and to 
												enable courts to administer 
												swift justice. The case of 
												Darkwa and Others v. Kwabi IV 
												(1992-93) GBR. P.380 per Wuaku 
												J.S.C. (as he then was), 
												highlights these objectives. It 
												was held there that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The rules must prima facie be 
												obeyed otherwise, as it was held 
												by the Privy Council in Ratnam 
												v. Cumarasamy (1965) 1 WLR 8 PC, 
												a party would have unqualified 
												right to extension which would 
												defeat the purpose of the rules 
												which was to provide a 
												time-table for litigation. See 
												also the case of Revici v. 
												Prentice Hall Incorporated 
												(1969) 1 WLR 157 CA.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It seems to me that if only 6 
												months time limit is allowed in 
												an ordinary Civil Appeal where 
												the Appellant has been diligent 
												in applying for extension of 
												time to enable him to appeal, it 
												would be proper and fair for 
												this court to take this 
												particular point into account 
												when exercising its discretion 
												on account of time to grant 
												special leave, of course 
												depending on the circumstances 
												of each particular case. In some 
												cases 6 months time limit ought 
												be just and reasonable while in 
												others admittedly longer period 
												of time ought to be allowed. It 
												would be just however to ensure 
												that indolent litigants are not 
												allowed to benefit from their 
												sloth to the disadvantage of the 
												vigilant litigant. This is a 
												balancing act which the courts 
												have always performed creditably 
												and admirably.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Considering the grounds of 
												appeal there appears to be prima 
												facie errors on the face of the 
												judgment of the Court of Appeal, 
												and a decision of the Supreme 
												Court on those issues I think 
												would enure to the benefit of 
												the public.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Further the applicant attributes 
												the reason for the delay in 
												applying for leave to his 
												lawyer. He said in Pars 8 - 9 of 
												his affidavit that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;8. That on contacting the 
												lawyer he informed me that while 
												busy working on the motion for 
												Stay of Execution it had escape 
												his mind that this is a case 
												commenced in a Circuit Court 
												which is below the High Court so 
												I cannot appeal to the Supreme 
												Court as of right but I require 
												leave of the Court of Appeal or 
												special leave of the Supreme 
												Court before an appeal could be 
												filed by me.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												9.&nbsp; That I then asked him to 
												seek the necessary leave to 
												enable the appeal to be filed 
												but he told me that by that date 
												11th of this month the time for 
												applying for leave from the 
												Court of Appeal had expired and 
												so the only thing left was for 
												me to apply for special leave of 
												the Supreme Court to make the 
												appeal, hence this application&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												If so, then it would be unfair 
												to penalize the Applicant for 
												the mistake of his counsel who 
												instead of first, applying for 
												leave, rather wasted time 
												applying for Stay of Execution. 
												In the case of Frimpong v. 
												Nyarko (1998-99) SC GLR p.734 at 
												holding (5) it was held that a 
												party is generally not to be 
												penalized for the misconduct of 
												a court official. See also the 
												English case of Gatti v. 
												Shoosmith (1939) 1 Ch.841 at 
												p.845-846 the Court of Appeal 
												per Sir Wilfred Greene M.R. 
												said:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;On the consideration of the 
												whole matter in my opinion under 
												the rule as it now stands, the 
												fact that the omission to appeal 
												in due time was due to the 
												mistake on the part of a legal 
												adviser, may be a sufficient 
												cause to justify the Court in 
												exercising its discretion. I say 
												&quot;may be,&quot; because it is not to 
												be thought that it will 
												necessarily be exercised in 
												every set of facts. Under the 
												law as it was conceived to be 
												before the amendment, such a 
												mistake was considered to be in 
												no circumstances a sufficient 
												ground. What I venture to think 
												the proper rule which this Court 
												must follow is: that there is 
												nothing in the nature of such a 
												mistake to exclude it from being 
												a proper ground for allowing the 
												appeal to be effective though 
												out of time; and whether the 
												matter shall be so treated must 
												depend upon the facts of each 
												individual case. There may be 
												facts in a case which would make 
												it unjust to allow the appellant 
												to succeed upon that argument.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The discretion of the Court 
												being, as I conceive it, a 
												perfectly free one, the only 
												question is whether, upon the 
												facts of this particular case, 
												that discretion should be 
												exercised, I should have thought 
												it was this one. We are not, I 
												think concerned here with any 
												question at all as to the merits 
												of this case or the probability 
												of success or otherwise. The 
												reason for the appellant's 
												failure to institute his appeal 
												in due time as a mere 
												misunderstanding, deposed to on 
												affidavit by the managing clerk 
												of the appellant's solicitors - 
												a misunderstanding which, to 
												anyone who was reading the rule 
												without having the authorities 
												in mind, might very well have 
												arisen. The period involved is a 
												very short one, it is only a 
												matter of a few days, and the 
												appellant's solicitors, within 
												time, informed the respondent's 
												solicitors by letter of their 
												client's intention to appeal. 
												That was done within the strict 
												time, and the fact that the 
												notice of appeal was not served 
												within the strict time was due 
												entirely to this 
												misunderstanding. On the facts 
												of this case, it appears to me 
												that the case is one where the 
												discretion of the Court ought to 
												be exercised, and accordingly, 
												leave will be given.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The above case has relevance to 
												this particular case. Applying 
												the guide lines enumerated above 
												and considering the 
												circumstances of this particular 
												case I am of the view that this 
												is a proper case in which to 
												exercise our discretion in 
												favour of the applicant and 
												grant him special leave to 
												enable him to appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I will accordingly grant special

												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In his affidavit in support of

												deposed, inter alia, as 
												follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;4. That after the judgment of 
												the Court of Appeal I decided to 
												engage a new lawyer to handle 
												the proposed appeal and related 
												application for stay of 
												execution but as the last 
												Christmas was only one day from 
												the date of the judgment and 
												everybody, including lawyers, 
												was very busy preparing for 
												Christmas I could not get a 
												lawyer before the Christmas who 
												would listen to me and decide if 
												he could be of help to me.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												5. That consequently it was not 
												until after the Christmas that I 
												could get a lawyer who accepted 
												to handle the appeal for me but 
												since, as stated above, my fear 
												was that unless prompt steps 
												were taken in that direction the 
												judgment in favour of the 
												Defendant might at any time be 
												enforced against me I instructed 
												the lawyer to act quickly in 
												getting a motion for stay of 
												execution filed for me.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												6.&nbsp; That as he was new to the 
												case the lawyer asked to be 
												given time to study the appeal 
												record to the Court of Appeal a 
												copy of which I furnished him 
												later as a result of that and 
												because his office was closed 
												for the Christmas holidays it 
												was not until 5th of this month 
												that he was able to give me a 
												motion for stay of execution 
												which I filed in the Court of

												could be filed by me.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												9.&nbsp; That I then asked him to 
												seek the necessary leave to 
												enable the appeal to be filed 
												but he told me that by that 
												date, 11th of this month, the 
												time for applying for leave from

												and so the only thing left was

												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Applicant has listed in his 
												affidavits in support of the 
												application more than eleven 
												grounds upon which he intends to 
												appeal. It is the Applicant's 
												contention that the Court of 
												Appeal failed to take into 
												account some matters in coming 
												to its decision. Some of these 
												matters as listed in the 
												original affidavit in support 
												are as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;d. The sale transaction could 
												not in all probability have been 
												in relation to part only of the 
												land which I was already in 
												occupation since the purchase 
												price was agreed by the two of 
												us at ¢50,000.00 and I fully 
												paid it to the Defendant for 
												which he issued a receipt, 
												although that receipt purports 
												to say that only part of that 
												land had been sold.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												e. Having received full payment 
												allegedly for part only of the 
												land sold or to be sold to me, 
												the Defendant immediately came 
												under an equitable obligation to 
												define the extent of the land 
												sold or to be sold to me, if 
												that part was not already 
												defined, since I had all along 
												been in occupation of the whole 
												land and thereafter continued to 
												do so and that by neglecting to 
												expressly define the portion 
												sold or to be sold to me the 
												Defendant had impliedly 
												demarcated that portion by 
												reference to so much of it as I 
												thereafter to his knowledge and 
												without his objection, occupied 
												as a purchaser in possession.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												f. The failure of the Defendant 
												to give any tangible reason for 
												his failure to demarcate the 
												portion sold or to be sold to me 
												when he had taken the full 
												purchase money from me and I had 
												been in possession of the whole 
												land without paying rent from 
												1989 when the 1985 tenancy 
												agreement was to expire 
												signified that he had impliedly 
												delivered possession of the 
												entire land to me as a purchaser 
												who had paid the full purchase 
												price and so fully performed all 
												that I was required to do under 
												the contract of sale.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												g. As two Ghanaians, the 1986 
												transaction between me and the 
												Defendant prima facie suggested 
												a transaction under customary 
												law so as to make me owner of 
												the land when I had paid the 
												purchase money in full and had 
												been allowed to go into 
												occupation as owner by the 
												seller.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												h. The rule, certum est qui 
												certum reddi in relation to the 
												problem of certainty, is 
												applicable to this case once I 
												had been occupying the land 
												since 1986 as purchaser.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												i. The sheer inequitable nature 
												of the Defendant's counterclaim 
												made in 1997 for recovery of the 
												whole land when I had already 
												paid the full purchase money to 
												him since 1986, a whole period 
												of 11 years earlier, and had all 
												that period been in possession 
												and the sale transaction had not 
												been mutually rescinded or 
												abrogated and he was and is 
												still keeping the purchase money 
												thereby unjustly enriching 
												himself at my expense.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												j. Allowing the Defendant's 
												counterclaim was tantamount to 
												enabling him to take advantage 
												of his own wrong of having 
												neglected during a whole period 
												of 11 years to demarcate the 
												part of the land sold or to be 
												sold to me when he had already 
												taken the full purchase price 
												from me and had every 
												opportunity to make such 
												demarcation as I was all the 
												time on the land and therefore 
												available to participate in any 
												such demarcation.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												k.&nbsp; The sheer repugnancy to 
												equity and good conscience of 
												the Defendant's counterclaim 
												when if the extent of the land 
												sold or to be sold really still 
												remained undefined, then that 
												was due to his own fault and I 
												was completely blameless and 
												had, on the assumption that I 
												owned the land as a purchaser, 
												made considerable expenditure in 
												improving the land.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Applicant, therefore, 
												deposed in paragraph 11 of his 
												affidavit as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;11. That I am advised by 
												Counsel and verily believe the 
												same to be true that the matters 
												raised above are sufficient to 
												show that the judgment of the 
												Court of Appeal must be wrong 
												and unfair to me since it has 
												deprived me, not only of the 
												¢50,000.00 I paid since 1986, 
												but also of the benefit of the 
												expenses I incurred in 
												developing the land as a 
												purchaser who had lawfully been 
												put into possession by his 
												vendor since 1986 or at least 
												since the end of April, 1989 
												when the tenancy agreement of 
												1985 was supposed to end.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Respondent's answer to the 
												application is of a technical 
												nature. In paragraphs 4 and 5 of 
												his affidavit in opposition, the 
												Respondent has deposed as 
												follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;4.&nbsp; That I am informed by my 
												Solicitor and I verily believe 
												to be true that the Applicant's 
												motion for special leave to 
												appeal was statute barred at the 
												time he filed the motion, since 
												it was not brought within the 14 
												days of the judgment delivered 
												by the Court of Appeal on the 
												23rd day of December, 1999.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												5. That again I am informed by 
												solicitor and I verily believe 
												same to be true that the 
												combined effect of paragraphs 
												(1), (2) and (4) of Rule 7 of 
												C.I. 16 is that the intended 
												Appellant against the Court of 
												Appeal's judgment, who needs 
												special leave to appeal when the 
												case emanated below High Court, 
												as in the instant case, has 2 
												forums open to him, that is, he 
												could either go to Court of 
												Appeal for the said special 
												leave or go to Supreme Court for 
												the same special leave but in 
												any event he must do so within 
												14 days from the date of 
												judgment against which special 
												leave to appeal is sought from 
												either of the 2 forums, for,

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) it cannot be said that in

												<p class="MsoNormal">

												(b) it is unwarranted to say

												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;(1) The provision in article

												provisions of article 131(1), 
												the Supreme Court might 
												entertain an application for 
												special leave to appeal in 
												respect of appeals from any

												might in appropriate cases 
												ignore the provisions of article

												Per curiam. We would .... like 
												to observe a close similarity 
												between the grounds for the 
												grant of special leave as 
												enunciated in Nyimoh ver. Dadzie 
												(supra) and article 131(1)(b) of 
												the 1992 Constitution where in

												question of law or is in the 
												public interest' .&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is quite clear from sub-rule 
												4 of Rule 7 of the Supreme Court 
												Rules, 1996 (C.I. 16), and from 
												its parent provision, article 
												131(2), both quoted above, that 
												the Supreme Court has an 
												unfettered discretion to grant 
												an application for special leave 
												to appeal in appropriate cases. 
												This, as correctly held by this 
												court in the Dolphyne case, 
												quoted above, is to enable this 
												Court, being the highest court 
												of the land, to have unfettered 
												discretion to do justice in 
												appropriate cases in order to 
												prevent a failure of justice or 
												injustice. And this discretion 
												is not to be affected by the 
												time limit of 14 days mentioned 
												in Rule 7(1) and (2) of C.I. 16. 
												It means therefore that the 
												Supreme Court can grant an 
												application for special leave to 
												appeal from a decision of the 
												Court of Appeal even though it 
												was not filed within 14 days 
												from the date of the judgment or 
												order sought to be appealed 
												against, or even if the 
												prospective appellant had failed 
												to first apply to the Court of 
												Appeal. That is the meaning of 
												article 131(2) of the 1992 
												Constitution, and Rule 7(4) of 
												C.I. 16.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the light of the above, it is 
												clear that the contention of the 
												Respondent's Counsel in the 
												present application before us 
												that this Court cannot entertain 
												this application since it was 
												not filed within 14 days is 
												untenable. No time limit has 
												been set under Rule 7(4) or 
												article 131(2) of the 
												Constitution.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This Court also held in its 
												holding (2) in the Dolphyne case 
												(supra) that </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;(2) In exercising its 
												unfettered discretion under 
												article 131(2) of the 1992 
												Constitution, the Supreme Court 
												was not bound by any rules of 
												practice or procedure nor any 
												legislation.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												At first, I thought that the 
												above pronouncement was too wide 
												as an appeal ought to be brought 
												within a limited period 
												according to the rules and that 
												if it is not brought within that 
												period it cannot be a valid 
												appeal. For example, including 
												the period within which the 
												Court can extend the period, an 
												appeal must be brought within 
												six(6) months from the date of 
												the judgment or order appealed 
												against. See Rule 8 of the 
												Supreme Court Rules, 1996 (C.I. 
												16). However, on reading 
												carefully section 4 of the 
												Courts Act, 1993 (Act 459), 
												which section deals with this 
												court&#8217;s appellate jurisdiction, 
												I have come to the conclusion 
												that this court's said 
												pronouncement in its holding (2) 
												in Dolphyne case, quoted above, 
												is correct. That is to say that 
												under article 131(2) of the 1992 
												Constitution, and under its 
												reproduced one in section 4(2) 
												of the Courts Act, 1993 (Act 
												459) and in Rule 7(4) of the 
												Supreme Court Rules, 1996 (C.I. 
												16), this Court has an 
												unfettered discretion to grant 
												an application for special leave 
												to appeal to the Supreme Court 
												from any decision of the Court 
												of Appeal, and that in 
												exercising this discretion, the 
												Court is not bound by any rules 
												of practice or procedure or any 
												legislation. I say so firstly 
												because article 131(2) of the 
												Constitution does not prescribe 
												any restriction, condition or 
												time limit in respect of the 
												exercise of the discretion given 
												under it. Secondly, the Court&#8217;s 
												Act, 1993, (Act 459), which 
												reproduces the above 
												constitutional provision in its 
												section 4(2), also does not 
												impose any restriction in the 
												exercise of the discretion given 
												to the Court. But, more 
												importantly, subsection 5 of 
												section 4 of the said Court&#8217;s 
												Act, Act 459, which prescribes 
												that &quot;the Supreme Court shall 
												not entertain any appeal unless 
												the appellant has fulfilled all 
												the conditions of appeal 
												prescribed under the Rules of 
												Court&quot;, exempts subsection 2 of 
												the Court&#8217;s Act from any such 
												conditions. In other words, the 
												Court&#8217;s discretion to grant 
												special leave to appeal under 
												article 131(2), of the 
												Constitution, section 4(2) of 
												the Courts Act, and rule 7(4) of 
												the Supreme Court Rules is not 
												subject to any conditions of 
												appeal prescribed under the 
												Rules of Court. Consequently, 
												all the conditions listed in 
												Rule 8 of the Supreme Court 
												Rules, 1996 (C.I. 16) including 
												time limits, would not apply 
												when this court is exercising 
												its discretion to grant special 
												leave to appeal under article 
												131(2) of the Constitution, or 
												the Courts Act, or under the 
												Rules.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Having come to the conclusion 
												that this Court can entertain 
												the present application before 
												the Court, I must now consider 
												whether or not the application 
												merits the exercise of our 
												discretion. In my view, the 
												Applicant has raised serious 
												legal questions about the 
												judgment of the Court of Appeal 
												which ought to be considered on 
												appeal by this Court. And in 
												order not to prejudice the 
												appeal which is yet to be filed, 
												I do not intend to go into 
												details. I would only say that 
												after reading the judgment of 
												the Court of Appeal and the 
												grounds stated in the 
												Applicant&#8217;s original and 
												supplementary affidavits, I am 
												of the view that there was 
												evidence that the Respondent 
												took money from the Applicant 
												and issued a receipt on it in 
												which he stated that the money 
												was the purchase price for land 
												he had sold to the Applicant. It 
												does not seem that the Court of 
												Appeal gave this issue the 
												serious consideration it 
												deserved, especially when there 
												was evidence that the Applicant 
												was in possession of the 
												property for a long time. Nor 
												did the court seem to have given 
												the receipt issued by the 
												Respondent the correct 
												appreciation.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Moreover, I strongly believe 
												that it would be unjust to blame 
												the Applicant personally for the 
												difficulties in which he found 
												himself. The one who brought 
												about these difficulties is the 
												Applicant&#8217;s solicitor. He filed 
												the wrong application, an 
												application for stay of 
												execution of the judgment, when 
												the proper thing to file in such 
												circumstances would be either a 
												notice of appeal or an 
												application for leave to appeal. 
												In this case the Applicant&#8217;s 
												lawyer should have filed an 
												application for leave to appeal 
												since the action started from 
												the Circuit Court and not the 
												High Court. If the application 
												filed at the Court of Appeal on 
												5th of January, 2000, was the 
												proper application, that is, for 
												leave to appeal, it would have 
												been within the 14 days required 
												by the rules since the judgment 
												of the Court of Appeal was 
												delivered on the 23rd day of 
												December, 1999. This shows that 
												the Applicant went to see the 
												lawyer early but the lawyer who 
												should know what application to 
												file, and not the Applicant who 
												engaged him, filed the wrong 
												application within time. It 
												would be most unjust in the 
												circumstances to blame the 
												Applicant and deny him his right 
												to appeal even though he seems 
												to have a good case. In the 
												English case of Gatti vrs. 
												Shoosmith [1939] 1 Ch. 845-46, 
												the English Court of Appeal 
												said:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;On consideration of the whole 
												matter, in my opinion under the 
												rule as it now stands, the fact 
												that the omission to appeal in 
												due time was due to a mistake on 
												the part of a legal adviser, may 
												be a sufficient cause to justify 
												the Court in exercising its 
												discretion.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												From the reasons given above, I 
												am of the firm view that this is 
												a proper case in which this 
												Court ought to exercise its 
												discretion under article 131(2) 
												of the 1992 Constitution, and 
												Rule 7(4) of C.I. 16 in favour 
												of the Applicant and grant him 
												special leave to appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I would therefore grant the 
												application.</span></p>

												the background of the case.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												One Joseph Kotey, the applicant 
												in this application, issued a 
												writ of summons on the 8th 
												January 1997 at the Somanya 
												Circuit Court against Peter Kofi 
												Koletey for the following 
												relief:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The plaintiff's claim from the 
												defendant is for specific 
												performance of the agreement for 
												the sale of a plot of land at 
												Ahiawoma at Somanya Zongo 
												opposite to SSNIT office at 
												Somanya being an area measuring 
												100 x 100 feet where plaintiff

												possession but refuses to 
												execute an indenture in favour 
												of plaintiff&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The defendant, on the other hand 
												counter-claimed in respect of 
												the same land for</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												1. Declaration of title to the 
												land described in paragraph 3 
												above,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2. Damages for breach of 
												contract,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3. Damages for trespass of law 
												described in paragraph 3,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												4. Recovery of possession, and</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												5. Perpetual Injunction 
												restraining the plaintiff, his 
												workmen, servants assigns and 
												agents from entering or 
												remaining on the land in 
												dispute.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On 19th August 1998 the trial 
												circuit court judge gave 
												judgment for the plaintiff and 
												dismissed the defendant's 
												counter-claim. The Court of 
												Appeal on 23rd December 1999 
												allowed the appeal of the 
												defendant and entered judgment 
												for the defendant on his 
												counter-claim for ¢500,000 
												damages for breach of contract, 
												and damages for trespass. The 
												damages for trespass was 
												assessed as the arrears of rent 
												from the expiration of the lease 
												agreement to the date of 
												judgment. What happened 
												thereafter is narrated by the 
												plaintiff in paragraphs 3 to 9 
												of his affidavit filed on 17th 
												January 2000 in support of his 
												application for special leave:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;3. That not being satisfied 
												with the judgment of the Court 
												of Appeal I desired to appeal to 
												the Supreme Court, but in view 
												of the Court of Appeal judgment 
												in favour of the defendant on 
												his counterclaim against me my 
												immediate concern was to obtain 
												an order of stay of execution 
												from the Court of Appeal against 
												enforcement of its judgment 
												since I entertained the fear 
												that the defendant might seek to 
												enforce it against me before the 
												appeal contemplated by me could 
												be filed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												4. That, after the judgment of 
												the Court of Appeal I decided to 
												engage a new lawyer to handle 
												the proposed appeal and related 
												application for stay of 
												execution but as the last 
												Christmas was only one day from 
												the date of the judgment and 
												everybody, including lawyers, 
												was very busy preparing for the 
												Christmas I could not get a 
												lawyer before the Christmas who 
												would listen to me and decide if 
												he could be of help to me.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												5. That consequently it was not 
												until after the Christmas that I 
												could get a lawyer who accepted 
												to handle the appeal for me but 
												since, as stated above, my fear 
												was that unless prompt steps 
												were taken in that direction the 
												judgment in favour of the 
												defendant might at any time be 
												enforced against me I instructed 
												the lawyer to act quickly in 
												getting a motion for stay of 
												execution filed for me.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												6. That as he was new to the 
												case the lawyer asked to be 
												given time to study the appeal 
												record to the Court of Appeal a 
												copy of which I furnished him 
												later as a result of that and 
												because his office was closed 
												for the Christmas holidays it 
												was not until 5th of this month 
												that he was able to give me a 
												motion for stay of execution 
												which I filed in the Court of 
												Appeal that same day.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												7. That on filing the motion I 
												took a copy to Somanya that day 
												for service on the defendant for 
												him to become aware that it was 
												not possible for him to enforce 
												the judgment given in his favour 
												on the counterclaim; it was 
												after I had done these I went 
												back to the lawyer to collect 
												and file the papers for the 
												appeal to the Supreme Court 
												which I had proposed to make.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												8. That on contracting the 
												lawyer he informed me that while 
												busy working on the motion for 
												stay of execution it had escaped 
												his mind that this is a case 
												commenced in a Circuit Court 
												which is below the High Court 
												and so I cannot appeal to the 
												Supreme Court as of right but I 
												required leave of the Court of 
												Appeal or special leave of the 
												Supreme Court before an appeal 
												could be filed by me.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												9. That I then asked him to seek 
												the necessary leave to enable 
												the appeal to be filed but he 
												told me that by that date, 11th 
												of this month, the time for 
												applying for leave from the 
												Court of Appeal had expired and 
												so the only thing left was for 
												me to apply for special leave of 
												the Supreme Court to make the 
												appeal, hence this application&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In his affidavit filed on 28th 
												February 2000 opposing the 
												application, particularly at 
												paragraphs 4 and 5, he averred:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;4. That I am informed by my 
												solicitor and verily believe to 
												be true that all the facts 
												stated in the supporting 
												affidavit of the Applicant's 
												motion do not constitute grounds 
												for seeking the special leave of 
												this Honourable Court to appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												5. That again I am informed by 
												solicitor and I verily believe 
												same to be true that the 
												combined effect of paragraphs 
												(1), (2) and (4) of Rule 7 of 
												C.I. 16 is that the intended 
												appellant against the Court of 
												Appeal's judgment, who needs 
												special leave to appeal when the 
												case emanated below High Court, 
												as in the instance case, has 2 
												forums open to him, that is, he 
												could either go to Court of 
												Appeal for the said special 
												leave or go to Supreme Court for 
												the same special leave but in 
												any event he must do so within 
												14 days from the date of 
												judgment against which special 
												leave to appeal is sought from 
												either of the 2 forums, for,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) it cannot be said that in 
												event of special leave to appeal 
												to Supreme Court under Rule 7(4) 
												the intended appellant has no 
												time limit within which he is to 
												seek the said leave, and</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) it is unwarranted to say 
												that in procedural law 
												concerning appeal against a 
												decision of judgment the Law 
												Maker would not set up time 
												limit within which to take a 
												step, if this were so then a 
												victorious party would never 
												known when to celebrate and 
												enjoy the fruits of victory of 
												the litigation, and no 
												litigation shall ever end&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The defendant's objection 
												therefore is that the plaintiff 
												ought to have come within 14 
												days from the date the Court of 
												Appeal delivered its judgment, 
												which was 23rd December.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Now from the facts, this is a 
												case which emanated from the 
												Circuit Court, that is, a court 
												below the High Court and 
												therefore appeal from the 
												judgment of the Court of Appeal 
												is required by article 131(1)(b) 
												of the constitution to be with 
												the leave of the Court of 
												Appeal. And regulation 7(1) of 
												Supreme Court Rules 1996 C.I. 16 
												governs applications for such 
												leave. The rule reads:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;7(1) An application for leave 
												to appeal under paragraph (b) of 
												clause (1) of article 131 of the 
												constitution shall be by motion 
												on notice in the Form 2 set out 
												in Part 1 of the Schedule to 
												these Rules and shall be filed 
												with the Registrar of the Court 
												below within fourteen days of 
												the date of the decision against 
												which leave to appeal is 
												sought&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Thus the leave to appeal under 
												article 131(1)(b) must be filed 
												within 14 days. But as the 
												applicant herein concedes he had 
												not complied with this 
												requirement and therefore now 
												seeks special leave under 
												article 131(2).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Application for special leave to 
												appeal is provided in regulation 
												7(2) and 7(4) of C.I. 16 these 
												rules read:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;7(2) An application for special 
												leave to appeal under clause (2) 
												of article 131 of the 
												constitution shall be by motion 
												on notice in the Form 3 set out 
												in Part 1 of the Schedule to 
												these Rules, and shall be filed 
												with the Registrar of the Court 
												within 14 days of the refusal of 
												the Court below to grant leave 
												to appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(4) Notwithstanding sub rules 
												(1) to (3) of this rule an 
												application for special leave to 
												appeal under clause (2) of 
												article 131 shall be entertained 
												by the Court and the Court may 
												grant leave on such terms as the 
												court may consider fit having 
												regard to the circumstances of 
												the case&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												What is the import of these two 
												regulations both of which talk 
												of special leave under article 
												131(2) of the Constitution?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is indeed important to 
												appreciate that the concept of 
												granting special leave to appeal 
												is not new in our jurisprudence. 
												It existed in the Courts Act 
												1950 (CA. 9) section 8(1) 
												proviso (a)(I) wherein the High 
												Court had power under certain 
												circumstances to grant special 
												leave to appeal to the then 
												Supreme Court. And in the case 
												of the Supreme Court's power to 
												grant special leave, the 1969 
												Constitution granted same in 
												article 105(4), the 1979 
												Constitution in its article 
												117(2), while as we have seen, 
												the 1992 Constitution granted 
												the same power in article 
												131(2). The language of the 
												constitutional provisions in the 
												1960, 1979 and 1992 Constitution 
												in respect of special leave to 
												appeal are the same.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												However, the Supreme Court Rules 
												1970 (now repealed) regulation 7 
												thereof which dealt with appeals 
												by leave and special leave under 
												the 1969 constitution, did not 
												have any regulation like 
												regulation 7(4) of the present 
												C.I. 16. The whole of regulation 
												7 of C.I. 13 read:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;7.(1) An application for leave 
												to appeal pursuant to the 
												provisions of paragraph (c) of 
												clause (1) of article 105 of the 
												Constitution shall be by motion 
												on notice in the Form 2 set out 
												in the first Schedule to these 
												Rules which shall be filed with 
												the Registrar of the Court below 
												within fourteen days of the date 
												of the decision against which 
												leave to appeal is sought.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) An application for special 
												leave to appeal pursuant to the 
												provisions of clause (2) of 
												article 105 of the Constitution 
												shall be by motion on notice in 
												the Form 3 set out in the First 
												Schedule to these Rules, which 
												shall be filed with the 
												Registrar of the Court within 
												fourteen days of the refusal of 
												the court below to grant leave 
												to appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3) Whole leave to appeal is 
												granted the appellant shall file 
												a notice of appeal in accordance 
												with the provisions of these 
												Rules&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Rule 7(2) of C.I. 16 therefore 
												made it clear that the Supreme 
												Court's power to grant special 
												leave as provided in article 
												105(2) of the 1969 Constitution 
												ought to be invoked within 
												fourteen days from the date the 
												court below refused an 
												application for leave. As to 
												whether regulation 7(2) of C.I. 
												16 really expressed the intent 
												of article 105(2) of the 1969 
												Constitution is now an academic 
												matter.</span></p>

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As said earlier on, regulation 7 
												of C.I 16 which regulates 
												appeals by leave and special 
												leave has two provisions on 
												special leave, that is, 7(2) and 
												7(4).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Regulation 7(2) of C.I. 16 in 
												plain language provides that an 
												application for special leave 
												under article 131(2) should be 
												filed within fourteen days from 
												the date the court below refused 
												to grant leave to appeal. Read 
												alongside article 131(1)(b) - 
												the provision that grants leave 
												to appeal in cases where the 
												suit began in court lower than 
												the High Court - it shows that a 
												person who has been refused 
												leave to appeal in 131(1)(b) may 
												come to the Supreme Court only 
												by asking for special leave 
												under regulation 7(2). And in 
												such circumstances the 
												application for special leave 
												must be filed within 14 days 
												from the date the Court of 
												Appeal refused to grant leave to 
												appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												But then 7(4) also provides that 
												notwithstanding 7(1)(2) and (3), 
												the Supreme Court may entertain 
												an application for special leave 
												under article 131(2) on such 
												terms as the court may consider 
												fit. It is this regulation 7(4) 
												which obviously gives power to 
												grant special leave if even the 
												applicant has not complied with 
												regulations 7(1) (2) and (3). 
												Regulation 7(4) is really in 
												line with section 4(5) of the 
												courts Act 1993 act 459 which 
												empowers the Supreme Court to 
												entertain an application for 
												special leave even if he has 
												fulfilled all the conditions of 
												appeals imposed on him. For 
												section 4(2) of Act 459 
												reproduces article 131(2) which 
												confers the power to grant 
												special leave. And to ensure 
												that the Supreme Court's 
												exercise of this power is not 
												circumscribed by any procedural 
												requirement section 4(5) of Act 
												459 provides:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;4(5) subject to sub-section (2) 
												of this section, the Supreme 
												Court shall not entertain any 
												appeal unless the appellant has 
												fulfilled all the conditions of 
												appeal prescribed under the 
												rules of Court&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is clear therefore that in 
												the face of section 4(5) of Act 
												459, a subsidiary legislation 
												like C.I. 16 cannot impose any 
												limitations on the Supreme 
												Court's power to grant special 
												leave under article 131 (2).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Applications for special leave 
												may therefore under C.I. 16, be 
												brought either under regulation 
												7(2) or 7(4). An application for 
												special leave under regulation 
												7(2) is meant for the situation 
												where the suit originated from a 
												court lower than the High Court, 
												and the Court of Appeal has 
												refused to grant leave to appeal 
												to the Supreme Court. In such a 
												situation one has to initiate 
												his application for special 
												leave within 14 days from the 
												date the Court of Appeal refused 
												to grant leave. If not the 
												applicant is out of court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Applicants for special leave 
												under regulation 7(4) of C.I. 16 
												are those brought in pursuance 
												of article 131(2) of the 
												Constitution. Such applications 
												are not regulated by time nor 
												affected by the applicant's 
												non-fulfillment of all the 
												conditions of appeal.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is a very potent power 
												given to the highest court of 
												the land to exercise it in the 
												supreme interest of justice in a 
												fit and proper situation. The 
												power is not in any way meant to 
												negate the time honoured 
												principle that there should be 
												an end to litigation. 
												Accordingly, an applicant who 
												applies to the Supreme Court for 
												special leave under 131(2) must 
												in my view satisfy the Supreme 
												Court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												i. Why he did not avail 
												himself/herself of the usual 
												rights of appeal (i.e. as of 
												right and by leave) provided</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												ii. Why he should be granted 
												such special indulgence. In this 
												connection the applicant must 
												pass the tests set out in 
												Dolphyne (No.2) vrs. Speedline 
												Stevedoring Co. Ltd. (1996-97) 
												SCGLR 373.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the instant case, the 
												applicant makes it clear that he 
												is out of time and therefore 
												seeks special leave under 
												article 131(2). From his 
												affidavit in support of his 
												application, it is clear that he 
												has undoubtedly committed some 
												procedural blunders. But he has 
												not relaxed in his efforts to 
												pursue his rights. Looking at 
												the time the Court of Appeal 
												delivered its judgment and the 
												closeness of the time within 
												which he had relentlessly being 
												seeking to appeal against that 
												judgment, it would be unfair to 
												deny him this request. 
												Accordingly, I would also grant 
												him special leave.</span></p>

												entertained&quot;, since it could not

												Rules of Court committee to 
												derogate from the provisions of 
												article 131(2) of the 
												Constitution. Rule 7(4) 
												therefore is only enabling and 
												discretionary. Rules 7(1) to (4) 
												of C.I. 16 show that the Rules

												Constitutional pattern for 
												special leave under article 
												131(2) of the Constitution. Rule 
												7(4) does not stipulate any time

												fourteen days after the entering 
												of conditional appearance or 
												within such other time as may be

												Consequently, no time having

												fourteen days&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												That course might be justified 
												under Order 74 of L.N. 140A

												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A comparison between rule 7(2) 
												of the revoked Rules of this 
												court, C.I. 13 and rules 7(1) to 
												(4) of C.I. 16 shows that the 
												omission of a time limit for 
												applying for special leave is 
												quite intentional. Under C.I. 
												13, I believe, and I so stated 
												in NSIAH V. AMANKWAH (1996-97) 
												SCGLR 453 at 465 - 466 that a 
												time limit was provided under 
												rule 7(2) for applying for 
												special leave to appeal to this 
												court in a manner that was out 
												of joint with article 131(2) of 
												the Constitution. Rule 7(2) of 
												C.I. 13 is re-enacted with minor 
												differences in rule 7(2) of C.I. 
												16 but then it is quickly 
												followed up with rule 7(4), 
												which does not make a prior 
												application to the Court of 
												Appeal for leave to appeal to 
												this court a sine qua non to an 
												application for special leave to 
												this court. Rule 7(4) of C.I. 
												16, be it noted, has no 
												equivalent in C.I. 13, the 
												revoked Rules of this court. Its 
												introduction into C.I. 16 
												without time limit was therefore 
												intentional. This is confirmed 
												by section 4 of the Courts Act 
												(1993) Act 459 particularly 
												subsections 2 and 5 thereof, to 
												which my brother Adjabeng 
												J.S.C., kindly drew my 
												attention. They are as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) Not withstanding subsection 
												(1) of this section, the Supreme 
												Court may entertain an 
												application for special leave to 
												appeal to the Supreme Court in 
												any cause or matter (including 
												interlocutory matter) civil or 
												criminal, and may grant leave 
												accordingly,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(5) subject to subsection (2) of 
												this section, the Supreme Court 
												shall not entertain any appeal 
												unless the appellant has 
												fulfilled all the conditions of 
												appeal prescribed under the 
												Rules of Court&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												These are provisions in pari 
												materia with article 131 of the 
												1992 Constitution and rules 7(1) 
												to (4) of C.I. 16 and show that 
												there are no conditions of 
												appeal (including time limit) ex 
												facie rule 7(4) of C.I. 16 to be 
												complied with in applying for 
												special leave to appeal to this 
												court. It follows therefore that 
												rule 7(4) of C.I. 16 confers a 
												discretion, simpliciter on this 
												court with regard to an 
												application for special leave to 
												appeal to this court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is well established that a 
												discretionary power ought not, 
												unless statute provides 
												otherwise, to be fettered by the 
												introduction of fixed 
												preconditions. As forcefully 
												stated in the Editorial note to 
												BLUNT V. BLUNT (1942) 2 All ER 
												613: &quot;The exercise of a 
												discretion cannot, from its very 
												nature, be made subject to 
												rules. Once a rule is 
												formulated, the discretion is 
												destroyed&quot;. And so it is trite 
												law that in the field of 
												judicial discretion, there are 
												no precedents properly so 
												called, see HYMAN V. ROSE 
												(1911-13) All ER 238, H.L. But 
												the discretion under Rule 7(4) 
												of C.I. 16 relating to 
												applications for special leave, 
												must, like, all other judicial 
												discretions be exercised 
												judicially.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Accordingly that judicial 
												discretion cannot be fettered 
												but must be guided by principles 
												of justice and fairness. Some of 
												the guidelines in considering an 
												application for special leave 
												are as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) Although an application for 
												normal leave must show some 
												merits in the intended appeal, 
												an application for special leave 
												must do more than that; it must 
												also give good and convincing 
												reasons why the application was 
												special, see KHOURY V. MITCHUAL 
												(1989-90) 2 GLR 259, NSIAH V. 
												AMANKWAH (1998-99) SC GLR 132 
												GATTI V. SHOOSMITH (1939) 3 All 
												ER 916 C.A followed in DOLPHYNE 
												V. SPEEDLINE STEVEDORING CO. 
												LTD. (1996-97)SC GLR 453.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) The application must be 
												brought timeously, having regard 
												to the circumstances of the 
												case, that is to say within a 
												reasonable time. See REPUBLIC V. 
												HIGH COURT, ACCRA, Ex parte 
												DARKE XII (1992) 2 GLR 688 S.C., 
												KHOURY V. MITCHUAL, supra.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3) Though there is no specific 
												time limit within which to apply 
												for special leave, the overall 
												maximum time limit for invoking 
												the appellate process revealed 
												by a consideration of the time 
												limits prescribed by C.I. 16 may 
												afford a useful guideline in 
												some cases as to whether an 
												application for special leave is 
												too tardy, see by analogy, 
												LUTTERODT V. MENSAH NYARKO 
												(1984-86) 1 GLR 237 C.A. 
												Headnote, holding (2).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(4) Where the respondent (or 
												third parties for that matter) 
												may be damnified irreparably, 
												the inconvenience to the court, 
												the conduct of the appellant in 
												all the circumstances, see by 
												analogy NYARKO V. LUTTERODT 
												(1984-86) 1 GLR 437 C.A., CARSON 
												V. CARSON (1983) 1 All ER 478 
												C.A.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(5) Even though failure to make 
												a prior application for leave to 
												appeal from the Court of Appeal 
												under rule 7(1) or to make the 
												application for special leave 
												within 14 days under rule 7(1) 
												of C.I. 16 after a refusal of an 
												application for leave by the 
												Court of Appeal, is not a bar to 
												an application to this court for 
												special leave, it is still pars 
												judicis to take those matters 
												into consideration in 
												determining an application for 
												special leave to appeal to this 
												court under rule 7(4) of C.I. 
												16. See KHOURY V. MITCHUAL, 
												supra, ADABLA V. GBEVLO AGAMA 
												(1939) 3 All ER 381 P.C.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(6) Special leave to appeal may 
												be granted</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) where a general principle of 
												law has arisen for the first 
												time, </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) a decision by the Supreme 
												Court on the point sought to be 
												appealed against will be 
												advantageous to the Public. See 
												DOLPHYNE (NO.2 V. SPEEDLINE 
												(1996-97) SCGLR 373, NSIAH V. 
												AMANKWAH (1998-1999) SCGLR 132.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(7) The overriding principle 
												however is that &quot;... the 
												discretion is conferred on this 
												court by the Constitution and 
												will be exercised in appropriate 
												cases bearing in mind the facts 
												of each presentation and the 
												need to prevent a failure of 
												justice. It should be clear 
												concerning the principles on 
												which special leave will be 
												granted. They are to be applied 
												as guides from which the court 
												may determine whether to grant 
												special leave or not&quot; see 
												DOLPHYNE (No.2) V. SPEEDLINE 
												STEVEDORING CO. LTD., supra.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The role the special 
												circumstances of a case can play 
												in the exercise of a discretion 
												is demonstrated by ADJEIODA V. 
												C.F.A.O. (1971) 2 GLR II where 
												Abban J (as he then was) granted 
												the applicant leave to go into 
												execution of a judgment obtained 
												17 1/2 years earlier under Order 
												42 rule 22 of L.N. 140A, which 
												had no time limit for such 
												applications provided 6 years 
												had elapsed after the judgment, 
												because of circumstances beyond 
												the control of the applicant. 
												Also in EASTON V. BROWN (1981) 3 
												All ER 278 Goulding J granted 
												extension of time to proceed on 
												an order for specific 
												performance after a lapse of 8 
												years.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the facts of those cases, the 
												result would have been the same 
												even if the application had been 
												for special leave to appeal. 
												However the courts must guard 
												against the abuse of their 
												process even though there be no 
												time limit for a step to be 
												taken. Inconceivable as it may 
												sound, in WILLIS V. EARL 
												BEAUCHAMP (1911-13) All ER 515 
												C.A. the plaintiff had the 
												effrontery to bring an action to 
												revoke a grant of Letters of 
												Administration made 90 years 
												earlier, on the grounds of 
												nullity. At page 518 Bowen L.J. 
												said</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;I think his action ought to be 
												stayed as being a vexatious 
												action within the meaning 
												attached to that word by the 
												courts. Because it can really 
												lead to no possible good&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Applying the above principles to 
												this case I agree with my 
												brother Adjabeng J.S.C. that the 
												facts of this case justify the 
												grant of the application for 
												special leave. The applicant 
												acted timeously in instructing 
												counsel, who did not diligently 
												attend to the matter and even 
												there not for an inordinate 
												period of time. It has been said 
												often that the sins of counsel 
												ought not to be visited on the 
												client's head. It is not however 
												an absolute principle and the 
												circumstances of the case will 
												dictate its application, see 
												GATTI V. SHOOSMITH applied in 
												DOLPHYNE V. SPEEDLINE 
												STEVEDORING CO. LTD. at 380, 
												supra and R. V. SECRETARY OF 
												STATE FOR HOME DEPARTMENT, ex 
												parte ALMEDAHWI (1989) 1 All ER 
												777 C.A. The applicant alleges 
												that he has paid ¢50,000 to the 
												respondent for part of land to 
												be sold to him by the 
												respondent. Though the exact 
												portion to be conveyed to him is 
												unspecified, that portion, 
												whatever it is, is part of a 
												larger piece of land the 
												identity of which is not in 
												issue, indeed the applicant says 
												he has been in possession of the 
												whole of it for many years. He 
												contends that in these 
												circumstances, applying the 
												maxim id certum est quid certum 
												reddi potest, it should be 
												possible to give effect to their 
												agreement.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In these circumstances I am of 
												the opinion that the application 
												raises a legal issue of general 
												public importance or 
												alternatively a matter of public 
												interest, whether on the 
												application of that maxim, it is 
												not possible to ascertain the 
												value of the whole property 
												whether at present or at the 
												time of the undeniable payment 
												of the ¢50,000.00 and convey so 
												much of the land as represents 
												that payment to the applicant. 
												After all in other contexts the 
												courts have given relief on the 
												basis of quantum meruit or 
												quantum valeat and I thought 
												similar considerations could 
												afford the applicant a remedy in 
												this case. I am far from saying 
												that if granted special leave to 
												appeal the applicant will 
												inevitably succeed, he may not, 
												but it is not clear that he will 
												certainly not succeed. In AHUMA 
												V. AKORLI (No.2) (1975) 1 GLR 
												473 the court was able to 
												overcome a not too dissimilar 
												problem of land sold but not 
												exactly ascertained.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In reaching this result I have 
												all along borne in mind that 
												this application is for special 
												leave to appeal as opposed to 
												other forms of leave and that 
												some of the guidelines I have 
												relied upon are applicable to an 
												application to the Court of 
												Appeal for leave to appeal under
