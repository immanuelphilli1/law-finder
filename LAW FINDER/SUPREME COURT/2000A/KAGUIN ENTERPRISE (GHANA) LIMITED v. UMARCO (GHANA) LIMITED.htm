												JUDGMENT</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												AMPIAH, J.S.C.:&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is unfortunate that I have to 
												disagree with my esteemed 
												brothers and sister on their 
												conclusion in this appeal. 
												However, I feel it is extremely 
												desirable that there should be 
												no doubt in the mercantile world 
												with regard to legal principles 
												that have long been recognised.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The facts in this case briefly 
												are that the Plaintiffs as 
												IMPORTERS [a fact which the 
												trial Court found], imported 
												into this country a quantity of 
												rice for sale, from Cargill 
												International S.A.&nbsp; The 
												consignment which was carried in 
												the ship MV OCEAN VOICE was 
												covered by an Invoice dated June 
												15th 1989 [this was tendered as 
												Exhibit &quot;B&quot;]. The goods arrived 
												at the Tema Harbour around 
												August, 1989.&nbsp; The Plaintiffs 
												having been given the relevant 
												documents, including a BILL OF 
												LADING [in a set of six], which 
												was endorsed to them, took step 
												to take delivery of the goods.&nbsp; 
												They engaged the services of the 
												Ghana Ports and Harbour 
												Authority for stevedoring and 
												shore handling for which payment 
												they could not settle in full 
												until action was taken against 
												them. They also paid the 
												Defendants [Umarco (Ghana) 
												Limited] for their clearing and 
												warehousing services. However, 
												when the Plaintiffs went later 
												for the release of the goods to 
												them the Defendants released 
												only a portion of the goods and 
												refused to release the rest 
												saying that they had 
												instructions from Cargill 
												International (the Shippers of 
												the goods) not to release the 
												rest to them. Despite repeated 
												demands, the Defendants refused 
												to release the rest of the 
												goods. The Plaintiffs therefore 
												took action against the 
												Defendants claiming ownership of 
												the goods, the release of the 
												goods to them, accounts and 
												damages for conversion.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The trial Court gave judgment in 
												favour of the Plaintiffs and 
												granted them the reliefs they 
												sought. Not satisfied, the 
												Defendants appealed to the Court 
												of Appeal which allowed the 
												appeal and set aside the 
												judgment of the Court below.&nbsp; It 
												is against this decision that 
												the Plaintiffs have appealed to 
												this Court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In its judgment, the Court of 
												Appeal relied religiously on the 
												BILL OF LADING [Exhibit &quot;A&quot;] and 
												the content thereof. Particular 
												reference was made to the words 
												&#8220;SHIPPER&quot; &quot;CONSIGNEE&#8221; and 
												&quot;NOTIFY ADDRESS&#8221;. In the columns 
												where these words have been 
												inserted there was no problem 
												with the columns 'SHIPPER' and 
												'NOTIFY ADDRESS' as the Court 
												found clearly that CARGILL 
												INTERNATIONAL were the Shippers 
												and KAGUIN ENTERPRISES GHANA 
												LIMITED the persons to be 
												notified. In the &#8220;CONSIGNEE&#8221; 
												column however was the words &quot;TO 
												ORDER&quot;.&nbsp; The Plaintiffs had 
												claimed that although their 
												names had not been inserted at 
												the column as the consignees, on 
												the evidence and the law, they 
												were consignees of the goods. 
												The trial Court acceded to this 
												claim but the Court of Appeal 
												held otherwise: It said Kaguin 
												[the Plaintiffs] were only to be 
												notified and that the goods were 
												to the order of Cargill 
												International. In other words 
												the goods were to go to whomever 
												Cargill International would 
												direct. Consequently, since the 
												Plaintiffs had not been 
												described as the consignees, 
												they could not claim any right 
												to the goods [the rice].</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It should be noted that the Bill 
												of Lading [Exhibit &#8220;A&#8221;] was an 
												agreement between the Shipper 
												and the owner of the ship, 
												though reference was made of 
												other persons in the document.&nbsp; 
												In Chapter 1 of Paul Todd's book 
												on &quot;CASES AND MATERIALS ON BILL 
												OF LADING&quot;, the author states:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;A BILL OF LADING is a receipt 
												issued by a carrier. Thus the 
												transfer of a Bill of Lading, 
												transfers an important right in 
												relation to the goods and in 
												effect the transfer of the Bill 
												of Lading is equivalent to the 
												transfer of the goods themselves 
												and that its transfer, transfers 
												constructive possession of the 
												goods&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the case of Sanders Brothers 
												v. Macleanco [1883] 11 Q.B.D. 
												327 [also in the Case Book on 
												'Shipping Law' by E.R. Hardy 
												Ivamy, 4th Edition] Bowen L.J 
												stressing the importance and 
												function of the Bill of Lading 
												as a document of title, states,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;A cargo at sea while in the 
												hand of the carrier is 
												necessarily incapable of 
												physical delivery. During this 
												period of transit and voyage, 
												the Bill of Lading by the Law 
												merchant is universally 
												recognised as its symbol and the 
												endorsement and delivery of the 
												Bill of Lading operates as a 
												symbolic delivery of the cargo. 
												Property of the goods passes by 
												such endorsement of the Bill of 
												Lading..... as under similar 
												circumstances the property would 
												pass by an actual delivery of 
												the goods. And for the purposes 
												of passing such property in the 
												goods and completing the tittle 
												of the endorsee to full 
												possession thereof, the Bill of 
												Lading until complete delivery 
												of the cargo has been made 
												onshore to someone rightly 
												claiming under it, remains in 
												force a symbol and carries with 
												it not full ownership of the 
												goods but also all rights 
												created by the contract of 
												carriage between the ship and 
												the shipowner. It is a key which 
												in the hand of a rightful owner 
												is intended to unlock the door 
												of the warehouse, floating or 
												fixed, in which the goods may 
												chance to be&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Paul Todd in his Book [supra] 
												explained the functions of the 
												specified persons set down in 
												the Bill of Lading thus,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;1. &#8216;SHIPPER&#8217; i.e. the person 
												who shipped the goods and who is 
												normally the consigner'.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2. &#8216;CONSIGNEE' i.e. the person 
												to whom the goods are consigned, 
												[in other words the person 
												entitled to the goods].</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3. 'NOTIFY ADDRESS' i.e. the 
												person who should be notified of 
												the arrival of the goods'.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												And, Charley and Giles in their 
												book &#8216;Shipping Law&#8217; 8th Edition 
												explained the purpose for these 
												categories on the Bill of Lading 
												at page 250-251 as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;In the Bill of Lading therefore 
												the carrier began to agree to 
												carry the goods, say to Antwerp 
												and there deliver them not only 
												(a) to the Shipper but 
												alternatively (b) to the 
												Shipper's order (as in the 
												instant case) so that the 
												Shipper could by endorsing on 
												the document can order that the 
												goods should be delivered to the 
												buyer to enable the latter to 
												get the goods himself or (c) to 
												a named consignee. These three 
												options, shared the common 
												feature that the Bill operated 
												as the document entitling 
												delivery only in favour of the 
												Shipper or the Shipper's buyer&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is quite clear from the above 
												explanation that three 
												categories of persons may be 
												entitled to the delivery of the 
												goods, namely (1) the Shipper 
												himself (2) to the Shipper's 
												Order which include the person 
												for whom the Bill of Lading has 
												been endorsed or (3) a named 
												Consignee.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Amissah, J. [as he then was] 
												delivering his judgment in the 
												case C.I.L.E.V. v. Black Star 
												Line Limited and Anor. (1968) 
												G.L.R 485 at pages 485-486, 
												observed</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Where the person unto whom it 
												is stated in this part that the 
												goods are shipped differs from 
												the one given in the &quot;notify 
												address&quot;. I cannot conceive the 
												name given in that notify 
												address being by any stretch of 
												the imagination described as the 
												Consignee. It is simple common 
												sense that the Consignee of 
												goods is the person to whom the 
												goods are sent and not 
												necessarily the address to be 
												notified of the arrival of the 
												goods at its predestined port. 
												All that the 'notify address' 
												means to me is that if the 
												address given is notified of the 
												arrival of the goods the person 
												to whom they are consigned or to 
												whom they ought to be delivered 
												will come forward to take 
												delivery of them. This person 
												may be the owner of the address. 
												But there is nothing preventing 
												him from being someone with whom 
												that owner may get in touch to 
												collect his goods waiting for 
												him at the harbour&quot;.&nbsp; (emphasis 
												supplied).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the above observation, his 
												Lordship did not think that the 
												evidence on record was enough to 
												identify the 'notify addressee' 
												as the owner of the goods but he 
												did not rule out the possibility 
												that in certain situations, the 
												'notify address&#8217; could be the 
												owner (i.e. the Consignee) of 
												the goods.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the instant case, there was 
												no consignee on the Bill of 
												Lading, but there was abundant 
												evidence both documentary and by 
												conduct to show that the goods 
												were consigned to the 
												Plaintiffs. If the Plaintiffs 
												were only to be notified, then

												In Chitty on 'Contracts', 27th

												Principles&quot; at page 600 
												paragraphs 12-081, the Learned 
												Authors wrote as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;It is often said to be a rule 
												of law that if there be a 
												contract which has been reduced 
												into writing, verbal evidence is 
												not allowed to be given,,,, so 
												as to add to or subtract from, 
												or in any manner to vary or 
												qualify the written contract&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Indeed in 1897, Lord Morris 
												accepted that &quot;parol testimony 
												cannot be received to 
												contradict, vary, add to or 
												subtract from the terms of a 
												written contract or the terms in 
												which the parties have 
												deliberately agreed to record 
												any part of their contract; this 
												rule is usually known as the 
												'parol evidence rule'. In 
												paragraphs 12-082 of 'Chitty on 
												Contracts' [referred to supra] 
												the Authors continued&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;However, the parol evidence 
												rule is and has long been 
												subject to a number of 
												exceptions. In particular, since 
												the nineteenth century, the 
												Courts have been prepared to 
												admit extrinsic evidence of 
												terms, additional to those 
												contained in the written 
												document if it is shown that the 
												document was not intended to 
												express the entire agreement 
												between the parties&quot;. (emphasis 
												supplied).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In Gillespie Bros. &amp; Co. vs. 
												Chevey Eggar &amp; Company Lord 
												Russel, C.J. stated&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;&#8230;. Although when the parties 
												arrive at a definite written 
												contract the implication or 
												presumption is very strong that 
												such contract is intended to 
												contain all the terms of their 
												bargain, it is a presumption 
												only, and it is open to either 
												of the parties to allege that 
												there was, in addition to what 
												appears in the written 
												agreement, an antecedent express 
												stipulation not intended by the 
												parties to be excluded but 
												intended to continue in force, 
												with the express written 
												agreement.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It cannot, therefore, be 
												asserted that, in modern times, 
												the mere production of a written 
												agreement, however complete it 
												may look, will as a matter of 
												law render inadmissible evidence 
												or other terms not included 
												expressly or by reference in the 
												document. The Court is entitled 
												to look at and should look at 
												all the evidence from start to 
												finish in order to see what the 
												bargain was what was struck 
												between the parties&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Perhaps it would not have been 
												necessary to refer to the above 
												observation, since the 
												Plaintiffs, apart from being 
												notified of the arrival of the 
												goods, were not parties to the 
												Bill of Lading. But since their 
												name appears on the Bill of 
												Lading as persons to be 
												notified, it is necessary to 
												look outside for evidence of 
												their connection to the Bill of 
												Lading. The Bill of Lading is an 
												agreement between only the 
												Shipper [the owner of the goods] 
												and the ship owner. It is a 
												receipt for goods delivered to 
												and received by a ship signed by 
												the person who contracts to 
												carry them and stating the terms 
												of the contract of carriage 
												under which the goods have been 
												so delivered and received. What 
												is contained in the Bill of 
												Lading may not contain all the 
												terms of the agreement between 
												the Plaintiffs and the owners of 
												the goods. In the instant case 
												great emphasis has been laid on 
												what the Bill of Lading says 
												without considering the 
												contractual relationship between 
												the Plaintiffs and the Shipper. 
												In other words the words of the 
												Bill of Lading are being 
												interpreted against Plaintiffs 
												when they were not parties to 
												that agreement. Could it be said 
												that the Plaintiffs were a mere 
												busy-body who were only to be 
												notified to pay for services, 
												clear the goods and warehouse 
												them without any interest 
												whatsoever in the goods even 
												though they have been found to 
												be the importers of the goods? 
												It is also said that there was 
												an agreement between the 
												Defendants and Cargill 
												International for the disposal 
												of the goods. I shall presently 
												comment on this so-called 
												agreement. Suffice it to say 
												that in this agreement the 
												Plaintiffs were not parties and 
												in fact were not aware of it. 
												The agreement was undated! If in 
												fact, there existed such an 
												agreement, why would the 
												Defendants ask the Plaintiffs to 
												pay for their services in 
												clearing or warehousing the 
												goods? Why should the Plaintiffs 
												as importers be kept in the dark 
												about this agreement? To do 
												justice in the case it is 
												necessary that all these issues 
												be resolved. It is necessary 
												that the totality of the 
												evidence be looked at 
												critically. That is why 
												extrinsic evidence is necessary 
												to explain and/or add to the 
												Statements in the Bill of 
												Lading.</span></p>

												Exhibit &quot;B&quot;, the Invoice issued

												which were shipped to Ghana. 
												This document is dated JUNE 15TH

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Bill of Lading contained the 
												same description and quantity of 
												rice as contained in the Invoice 
												[Exhibit &quot;B&quot;]. The goods were 
												shipped on M.V. OCEAN VOICE. The 
												'B/L' on the Invoice is the 
												abbreviated form of &quot;Bill of 
												Lading&quot; which was to accompany 
												the shipment. The date on the 
												Invoice is identical with the 
												date on the original Bill of 
												Lading which followed the 
												shipment of the goods. This was 
												a &#8216;CIF&#8217; [Cost, Insurance and 
												Freight] contract which stated 
												the full amount [inclusive of 
												the cost, insurance and freight] 
												which was due to the Shipper on 
												the delivery of the goods. This 
												Invoice was duly signed by 
												Cargill International, the 
												original owners of the goods and 
												as the Shippers. This was part 
												of the documents handed over to 
												the Plaintiffs when the goods 
												arrived to enable them take 
												delivery of the goods. </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In considering the nature of the

												relationship between the 
												parties, it is necessary not to 
												look only at the Bill of Lading, 
												but also at all the documents 
												given to the Plaintiffs, 
												together with the conduct of the 
												parties, to identify who in fact 
												are the consignees of the goods.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">

												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">

												not. It has been said that the 
												document must not only be in 
												fact in existence when the 
												contract is made, but also it 
												must be described as existing. 
												It follows that if the contract 
												refers to the document to be 
												incorporated, parol evidence is 
												admissible to enable the 
												document to be identified, but 
												parol evidence is not admissible 
												to prove that the document was

												In Ghana, like any other

												importation of goods are 
												governed by Statute Law. One 
												does not just get up, collect a 
												quantity of goods and import the 
												goods to another country and 
												start selling them to the 
												people. The law governing 
												exportation and importation of 
												goods in Ghana is contained in 
												the Export and Import Act, 1995 
												[Act 503] Section 7 of this Act 
												states:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;(1) Any person may import goods 
												into Ghana for commercial 
												purposes if that person 
												completes an Import Declaration

												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) An importer shall submit one

												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3) No Importer shall be

												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It follows then that without 
												compliance with the Statute, 
												Cargill International could not 
												import rice into the country and 
												direct Umarco (Ghana) Limited 
												(the Defendants in this case) to 
												sell when the latter were not 
												the importers. As was found by 
												the Court below, the only person 
												who could be described as the 
												&#8216;Importer&#8217; legitimately is the 
												Plaintiff/Company. It cannot be 
												true therefore that Cargill 
												International could import goods 
												[rice] to this country and have 
												them sold in accordance with 
												their 'Order' without specified 
												or named importer who is 
												qualified to take delivery of 
												the goods and sell them in 
												Ghana.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The so-called agreement between 
												Cargill International and Umarco 
												(Ghana) Limited [the Defendants] 
												is false and designed to defeat 
												the ends of justice. It was 
												undated. Definitely it was made 
												after the impasse between Sane 
												and Diawusie, the shareholders 
												in the Plaintiff/Company. There 
												was evidence that Mr. Sane had 
												been working with Cargill 
												International in the importation 
												and sale of rice. It is 
												therefore not true that Cargill 
												International at the time it 
												sent the rice in dispute wanted 
												them to start trading in rice 
												importation in Ghana as the said 
												agreement purported to say.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												According to Mr. Diawusie [the 
												Plaintiffs' Representative] who 
												testified on behalf of the 
												Plaintiffs, he as well as Mr. 
												Sane took part in the 
												negotiations which culminated in 
												the sending of the rice to 
												Ghana. Under cross-examination, 
												this is what the Plaintiffs' 
												Representative said,</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;&#8230;. I know about the 
												negotiations which led to the 
												importation of the rice. The 
												negotiation was between Cargill 
												and Kaguin Enterprise.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Yes, I took part in the 
												negotiation. The terms of the 
												negotiation &#8212; Cargill was to 
												send the rice to Kaguin in Ghana 
												who will sell, and thereafter 
												pay Cargill&quot;. (emphasis 
												supplied).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There was no challenge to this 
												vital piece of evidence. Of 
												course Cargill International 
												itself never gave evidence of 
												the terms of this agreement. 
												This agreement was prior in time 
												to the so-called agreement 
												between Cargill International 
												and Umarco [Ghana] Limited [the 
												Defendants].</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I should have thought that 
												having authorised the Defendants 
												to sell the rice, Cargill 
												International would have joined 
												in the action or testified in 
												contradiction of the alleged 
												terms of the negotiated 
												agreement as given in evidence 
												by the Plaintiffs&#8217; 
												representative and, also 
												explained how Exhibit &#8220;B&#8221; [the 
												Invoice] which was prepared and 
												signed by Cargill International 
												came into existence and why the 
												Plaintiffs which were to be 
												notified only of the arrival of 
												the goods came by Exhibit &#8220;B&#8221; 
												and were also made responsible 
												for the customs clearance, 
												stevedoring, clearing and 
												warehousing expenses of the 
												goods. Thus even though the Bill 
												of Lading did not state on the 
												face of it that the Plaintiffs 
												were the consignees of the 
												goods, the preponderance of the 
												evidence supported the 
												Plaintiffs claim that they were 
												the consignees or owners of the 
												goods imported. The evidence 
												overwhelming shows that all the 
												relevant documents necessary for 
												taking delivery of the good were 
												sent to the Plaintiffs. These

												As stated before, this piece of 
												evidence was not challenged; 
												this was confirmed by Mr. Max 
												Paillades, the Defendants' 
												Managing Director who said, 
												&quot;Kaguin was to pay Cargill 
												International&quot;. There is no 
												evidence that the price was 
												demanded of the Plaintiffs 
												before the Bill of Lading was 
												endorsed to them. It has been 
												argued that since the Plaintiffs 
												had not paid for the rice, they 
												could not demand the release of 
												the rice to them. If it is 
												established that the property in 
												the goods had passed to the 
												Plaintiffs, it would not be a 
												proper duty of the Court to deny 
												the Plaintiffs their claim to 
												the goods. The remedy of the 
												seller would be as set down 
												under the Sale of Goods Act. The 
												Plaintiffs gave evidence of the

												Cargill International; they were 
												&#8220;to sell the rice and pay

												The evidence shows 
												overwhelmingly that all the 
												relevant documents were handed 
												over to the Plaintiffs. On the 
												Defendant's own evidence, 
												through Max Palliades, when the 
												goods arrived he endorsed the 
												Bill of Lading, six in number 
												including Exhibit &quot;A&quot; to the 
												Plaintiffs who engaged the 
												Defendants as clearing and 
												warehousing agents; the 
												Defendants were paid. Thus, on 
												the evidence as I have tried to 
												establish, the Plaintiffs were 
												consignees and even if this is 
												not acceptable they were 
												endorsees of the Bill of Lading. 
												The property in the goods under 
												the Sale of Goods Act, 1962 [Act 
												137] passed to them. And even if 
												subsequently other copies of the 
												Bill of Lading were issued to 
												some other persons, the first 
												endorsement not only of a part 
												of the goods but all the goods 
												as contained in the Bill of 
												Lading, vested in them the 
												property in the goods; all other 
												endorsements were unenforceable. 
												In Charles Barber and Ors. vs. 
												William Meyerstein [1970] L.R. 4 
												HL 317 it was held inter alia&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The person who first gets the 
												Bill of Lading [though only one 
												of a set of three] gets the 
												property which it represents, he 
												need not do any act to assert 
												his title, which the transfer of 
												the Bill of Lading of itself 
												renders complete, and any 
												subsequent dealings with the 
												others of the set are 
												subordinate to the rights passed 
												by that one&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It has not been shown that the 
												Plaintiffs used fraud or some 
												tricks to obtain the Bill of 
												Lading. In fact the evidence 
												shows that they were duly 
												informed of the shipment of the 
												goods, and their arrival at the 
												harbour and, all documents in 
												respect of the goods, including 
												the Bill of Lading were handed 
												over to them. The Bill of Lading 
												was endorsed to them and they in 
												pursuance thereof took the 
												necessary steps to get the goods 
												evacuated from the ship, cleared 
												and warehoused at their own 
												expense. What else were they 
												supposed to do to show that they 
												were the owners of the goods?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Defendants were paid for 
												their services. This was 
												admitted by Mr. Max Palliades&nbsp; 
												[D.W.2], the Managing Director 
												of the Defendant/Company. The 
												Defendants were therefore only 
												clearing and warehousing agents. 
												Their relationship with the 
												Plaintiffs was in the form of 
												bailment for consideration i.e. 
												hire of custody [locatio 
												custodiae]. There was a contract 
												of custody for reward for 
												services. As custodians they 
												were to deal with the goods in 
												the manner authorised by the 
												bailor [the Plaintiff]; they 
												could not without authority hand 
												the goods over to a third party. 
												If they deal with the goods in a

												As I have said elsewhere in my 
												opinion, it is not true that the 
												shipment of the instant rice was 
												the first business that Cargill 
												International was starting in 
												the country. According to Mr. 
												Palliades [D.W.2], Cargill 
												International has been doing

												The agreement purported to have

												International and Umarco 
												[Defendants] trying to show that 
												Cargill International was then 
												trying to start business in 
												Ghana could not have been made 
												before the importation of the 
												rice. Besides, if indeed it had 
												existed, Cargill International 
												and for that matter the 
												Defendants would not have placed 
												the responsibility of 
												off-loading on the Plaintiffs 
												and it would not have been 
												necessary for the Defendants to 
												charge the Plaintiffs for 
												clearing and warehousing. Why 
												were the Plaintiffs to be 
												notified only? According to 
												Chairman of N.I.C. [D.W.3], 
												N.I.C. by its letter of 11th 
												April, 1990 informed Umarco [the 
												Defendants] to get in touch with 
												Cargill International to direct 
												what was to be done with the 
												remaining quantity of rice! It 
												is quite clear from the evidence

												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A critical look at the powers of 
												the N.I.C. would show that if at 
												all, the only matters it could 
												have investigated in the instant 
												case fell under paragraphs (b) 
												and (c) of Section 3. The Ghana 
												Investment Promotion Centre 
												itself had not referred to

												[N.I.C.] though it claimed Sani, 
												one of the Shareholders in the 
												Plaintiff/Company was a 
												foreigner and had not satisfied 
												the conditions which would 
												enable him do business in Ghana. 
												Therefore there could not have 
												been an allegation of breaches 
												of mandatory provisions of the 
												Constitution or Proclamation to 
												enable N.I.C. investigate under 
												para.[b]. The matter brought 
												before N.I.C. was a personal 
												matter between Mr. Diawusie and 
												Mr. Sani Shareholders in the 
												Plaintiff/Company where Mr. 
												Diawusie accused Mr. Sani of 
												cheating him in their business. 
												D.O. Lamptey [D.W.3] the 
												Chairman of N.I.C. said&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Yes, I agree that Exhibit 21 
												should be confined to the fact 
												that a foreign national was 
												carrying on business in this 
												country&quot;. (emphasis supplied).</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It was not the business of 
												N.I.C. therefore to pronounce on 
												the ownership of the rice in 
												dispute. Besides, it was 
												required that the N.I.C. report 
												periodically to the Provisional 
												National Defence Council for the 
												appropriate action. [see Section 
												12 of P.N.D.C.L. 2]. Further, 
												Section 11 of P.N.D.C.L. 2 
												states:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;11. Where the Committee is 
												satisfied from its 
												investigations that there exists 
												evidence which may be put before 
												a Court, Public Tribunal or 
												other judicial body, it shall 
												refer such evidence to the 
												Attorney-General Public 
												Prosecutor or to any other 
												appropriate body for further 
												steps, including a trial, to be 
												taken in the matter&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Of course, since Mr. Sani, an 
												alien, failed to satisfy the 
												provisions of the Ghana 
												Investment Promotion Centre Law, 
												he could not continue as the 
												Managing Director of Kaguin [the 
												Plaintiff/Company]. The Bank was 
												entitled lawfully to withdraw 
												its security. This left Mr. Sani 
												as a Managing Director who could 
												do no business. This situation 
												however did not take away the 
												rights vested in Kaguin [the 
												Plaintiffs] in so far as their 
												contractual relationship with 
												Cargill International in the 
												importation of the rice was 
												concerned.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												A distinguishing characteristic 
												of a company limited by shares 
												such as the Plaintiff/Company is 
												that once the formalities of the 
												Act [the Companies Code] have 
												been complied with the 
												registered company exists as a 
												legal entity distinct in law 
												from those persons who from time 
												to time are members &#8212; see Salmon 
												vs. Salmon &amp; Company Limited 
												[1897] H.L. A.C. 22. Even though 
												it was Sani and Diawusie who 
												negotiated for the rice in 
												dispute, they did so for Kaguin 
												&amp; Company Limited. So, whatever 
												contract there was, was between 
												Kaguin and Cargill 
												International.&nbsp; The fact that 
												Mr. Diawusie complained against 
												Sani did not affect the stand of 
												Kaguin in the contract with 
												Cargill International. By going 
												outside the matter, which was 
												reported to it, and issuing a 
												report (which required some 
												security from Sani) and the 
												Ghana Investment, which required 
												that Sani, a foreigner satisfy 
												the Statutory requirement before 
												doing business. The report 
												generated a lot of 
												correspondence among the 
												above-named authorities. In that 
												confused state of affairs, 
												Cargill International and its 
												associates decided to find a 
												means of disposing of the 
												imported rice. Since the rice 
												was already with Umarco [the 
												Defendants] for warehousing and 
												there was an already existing 
												relationship between Umarco and 
												Cargill International, Cargill 
												International decided to let 
												Umarco have the rice as its 
												agent for purpose of selling 
												them. They subsequently 
												contracted with SAGA GHANA 
												LIMITED [which was formerly 
												UMARCO GHANA LIMITED] to have 
												the rice sold apparently, in 
												pursuance of a Court Order.
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Under those circumstances, 
												Cargill International pretended 
												as if it had a previous 
												agreement with Umarco to dispose 
												of the rice in accordance with 
												the former's order. I have 
												already commented on the 
												so-called agreement: It was a 
												fraudulent device!!</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Even though the Bill of Lading 
												did not show that the rice had 
												been consigned to the Plaintiff 
												but 'TO ORDER' the evidence 
												shows that there could have been 
												no other consignee apart from 
												the Plaintiffs to whom the Bill 
												of Lading was endorsed and which 
												in fact carried out their part 
												of the agreement as contained in 
												the Invoice sent them, by paying 
												for the services required for 
												unloading the rice and 
												warehousing it at the warehouse 
												of the Defendants. By the 
												authorities referred to in this 
												my opinion the property in the 
												goods became vested in the 
												Plaintiffs when all the relevant 
												papers were handed over to them 
												and they took delivery of the 
												goods. The property in the goods 
												having thus passed, Cargill 
												International could only pursue 
												their rights under the Sale of 
												Goods Act, 1962 [Act 137], 
												Section 44 of which states:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;44. Subject to the provisions 
												of this Act, and subject to any 
												contrary intention an unpaid 
												seller may recover possession of 
												the goods from the buyer after 
												they have delivered to him if&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) the property has not passed 
												to the buyer; or</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) the property has passed to 
												the buyer but the contract 
												expressly confers a right on the 
												seller to recover possession and 
												the buyer fails to pay the price 
												in accordance with the terms of 
												the contract, but not 
												otherwise&quot;. (emphasis supplied)</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The only terms of the contract 
												was supplied by the Plaintiffs' 
												representative in Court. It was 
												that the rice was to be sold and 
												paid for later. There was no 
												other evidence. The seller was 
												therefore not entitled to 
												recover possession of the goods.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												An unpaid seller may also resell 
												the goods in certain situations 
												&#8211; vide Section 45 of Act 137; 
												and he may sue for the price of 
												the goods &#8212; vide Section 46 of 
												Act 137.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The property in the goods vested 
												in the Plaintiffs as soon as 
												they took delivery of them. The 
												Defendant had possession but 
												only as bailees. As bailees for 
												consideration, they were not 
												entitled to release or hand over 
												the goods to any other person 
												except the bailor (the 
												Plaintiffs). The refusal to 
												release the rice to the 
												Plaintiffs on demand and the 
												handing over of the goods to 
												Cargill International amounted 
												to conversion; the Plaintiffs 
												were entitled to recover damages 
												for conversion. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The judgment of the High Court

												The action in this case by the

												the appeal presently before us 
												is, to me, uncalled for. I must 
												say that in my view it is not 
												only a frivolous action, but it 
												is also an attempt to dupe the 
												owners of the goods involved. 
												That is, Cargill International 
												S.A. Antigua. For, how else can 
												one explain the conduct of the 
												Appellants when they have failed 
												up to today to pay for the seven 
												hundred metric tonnes of rice

												them are as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;1. A declaration that the

												of 4,659.014 metric tonnes of 
												rice imported from Cargill 
												International S.A. Antigua in or 
												about July 1989.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2. An order upon the Defendant

												rice or any portion or part of 
												the said consignment disposed of 
												by the Defendant.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">

												3. Another order upon the

												What is the basis of the 
												Appellants' claim? In paragraph 
												3 of their statement of claim, 
												the Appellants aver that they 
												imported the said consignment of 
												rice from Cargill. In their 
												paragraph 6, the Appellants aver 
												that they ordered the said rice. 
												The most significant averment in 
												the Appellants' statement of 
												claim, however, is in paragraph 
												5 thereof. There they aver as 
												follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The Defendants were shipping 
												agents, and were in receipt of 
												the Bill of Lading, which stated 
												that the Plaintiff was the party 
												to be notified of the arrival of 
												the rice, and the consignee of 
												the said goods was 'TO ORDER'.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												According to the Appellants in 
												their statement of claim, when 
												the rice arrived, the 
												Defendants/Appellants/Respondents 
												herein released to them only 
												&#8220;14,000 bags of rice weighing 
												700 metric tonnes&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Appellants aver that the 
												Respondents refused to release 
												the remainder of the rice to 
												them and purported &quot;to act upon 
												an agreement between them, [the 
												Respondents] and Cargill 
												International S.A. Antigua with 
												its offices in Geneva&quot; which 
												agreement the Appellants 
												considered illegal. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The 
												Defendants/Appellants/Respondents' 
												answer to the Appellants' claim 
												is amply stated in their 
												statement of defence, especially 
												paragraphs 2 to 7. There they 
												aver as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;2. The Defendant ... says that 
												the said rice described in the 
												said paragraphs were imported by 
												Cargill International S.A. 
												Antigua Geneva Branch as 
												manifested in the bill of lading 
												when it stated in the column of 
												consignee 'TO ORDER' but 
												requesting that the Plaintiff be 
												notified of the importation of 
												the rice and thus caused the 
												Plaintiff&#8217;s name to be inserted 
												in the notifying column of the 
												Bill of Lading.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3.&nbsp; The Defendant says that the 
												declarations on the Bill of 
												Lading dated 10th July 1989, 
												which covered the importation of 
												the rice, indicated that there 
												was no consignee. That the 
												shipper will inform the agent 
												later on whom the rice should be 
												delivered to by stating in the 
												column reserved for consignee 
												'TO ORDER'.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												4. The Defendant says that it is 
												usual for shippers to protect 
												themselves when a consignment 
												has not been paid for, as was 
												the case in this shipment, to 
												hold on to the commodity and 
												allow it to remain their 
												property by inserting in 
												consignee column 'TO ORDER' as 
												was done in this shipment's Bill 
												of Lading of 10/7/89.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												5. The Defendant says that 
												Cargill International S.A. 
												Antigua, Geneva Branch remained 
												owner of the rice throughout.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												6. The Defendant denies 
												paragraph 6 of the statement of 
												claim and says that whether or 
												not the Plaintiff ordered the 
												whole consignment of rice is 
												neither here nor there. The 
												important issue is whether it 
												paid for it and all the other 
												incidental expenses to enable 
												Cargill International S.A. 
												Antigua Geneva Branch the owner 
												of the rice to deliver it to it.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												7. In answer to paragraph 7 of 
												the statement of claim the 
												Defendant says that the 14,000 
												bags of rice released to the 
												Plaintiff was all that Cargill 
												International S.A. Antigua 
												Geneva Branch authorised the 
												Defendant to release to the 
												Plaintiff under the Agreement 
												between Cargill International 
												S.A. Antigua Geneva Branch and 
												Saga acting for and on behalf of 
												Umarco (Ghana) Limited, and 
												acting as Umarco's true and 
												lawful attorney. The Plaintiff 
												was not entitled to anything 
												else and the Defendant could not 
												give it anything more than the 
												owner had instructed.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												From the Plaintiffs/Appellants' 
												own statement of claim, and the 
												explanation given in the 
												Respondents' statement of 
												defence, as quoted above, it is 
												clear that the Appellants' 
												action was doomed to failure. In 
												paragraph 5 of their statement 
												claim, quoted above, the 
												Appellants admit that the bill 
												of lading in respect of the rice 
												imported, which bill, in 
												shipping law and practice, is 
												the document of title to the 
												goods shipped, was not sent to 
												them, the Appellants, but to the 
												Respondents who are shipping 
												agents and warehousing 
												operators. Secondly, in the said 
												bill of lading, according to the 
												Plaintiffs' said paragraph 5, 
												the Plaintiffs were not stated 
												as the consignees of the goods 
												but only as the &quot;party to be 
												notified of the arrival of the 
												rice&#8230;.&#8221; And, more importantly, 
												according to the said paragraph 
												5, the consignee of the rice was 
												stated to be &quot;TO ORDER&quot;. What 
												does this term &quot;to order&quot; mean? 
												Simply, this means that the rice 
												shipped was still under the 
												control of the owners and 
												shippers thereof, namely, 
												Cargill International, to be 
												delivered to whomsoever they 
												would instruct the holders of 
												the bill of lading to deliver. 
												In this case, the owners of the 
												goods sent the bill of lading to 
												the Respondents herein and 
												instructed them to store the 
												rice in their warehouse. They 
												were also to deliver seven 
												hundred tonnes thereof (that is, 
												14,000 bags) to the Appellants 
												herein who were to pay for it 
												and also pay all the incidental 
												expenses made in respect of the 
												said quantity of rice. The 
												evidence also shows that the 
												owners of the rice, Cargill 
												International, instructed the 
												Respondents to deliver to the 
												Appellants another consignment 
												of the same quantity whenever 
												they had fully paid for the 
												first consignment released to 
												them.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is surprising that even 
												though the Plaintiffs/Appellants 
												clearly admitted in the said 
												paragraph 5 of their statement 
												of claim that they were not 
												mentioned as the consignees of 
												the rice in the bill of lading 
												(their exhibit &quot;A&quot;), they 
												contradicted this in their 
												evidence. In his evidence under 
												cross-examination at the trial, 
												the Appellants' representative 
												said categorically that &quot;By 
												Exhibit &quot;A&quot; I am the 
												consignee&quot;.&nbsp; This contradicts 
												not only the said paragraph 5 of 
												the Appellants' statement of 
												claim, but also the bill of 
												lading, Exhibit &quot;A&quot;, tendered in 
												evidence by the Appellants. Yet 
												the trial High Court ignored 
												this serious contradiction in 
												the Appellants' case and gave 
												judgment for them.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On appeal to the Court of 
												Appeal, the appellate Court 
												rightly reversed the trial High 
												Court's decision. In a clear, 
												sound and comprehensive judgment 
												delivered by the Court of 
												Appeal, the Court, per Foster, 
												J.A. (as he then was), of 
												blessed memory, stated, inter 
												alia, as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The trial judge purported to 
												rely on C.I.L.E.V. vrs. BLACK 
												STARLINE LTD. (1968) GLR 485, 
												C.A. BUT in that case Amissah, 
												J.A. (as he then was) said at 
												pp. 485 - 486:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												'where a person unto whom it is 
												stated in this part that the 
												goods are shipped differs from 
												the one given in the 'notify 
												address', I cannot conceive the 
												name given in that notify 
												address being by any stretch of 
												imagination described as the 
												consignee. It is simple common 
												sense that the consignee of the 
												goods is the person to whom the 
												goods are sent and not 
												necessarily the address to be 
												notified of the arrival of the 
												goods at the predestined port.'
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Thus, in the instant case the 
												notify address cannot be 
												comprehended as the consignee, 
												for if indeed the shipper 
												Cargill had intended the 
												Respondents (Appellants herein) 
												as the 'consignee&#8217; their name 
												would have been inserted in that 
												space reserved for that 
												designation and not 'notify 
												address'. In the Bill of Lading, 
												the rice was consigned 'To 
												Order'. That means delivery to 
												any particular person as may be 
												determined or ordered by the 
												shipper. In the Black Star Line 
												Ltd. case, cited infra, Amissah, 
												J.A., having&nbsp; considered some 
												English cases; observed at page 
												487: 'I do not think that these 
												authorities support the 
												proposition that where goods are 
												shipped under a bill of lading 
												which expressly says that the 
												carriers must deliver to the 
												order of the shippers, just 
												because on previous occasions 
												the shipper had ordered that the 
												goods be delivered to a 
												particular person, so the 
												carrier must deliver to that 
												same person even though this 
												time the shipper orders that 
												they be delivered to another...
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												I do not therefore agree that 
												the course of business entitles 
												the Defendants, as carriers, to 
												predetermine the consignees of 
												goods which according to the 
												bill of lading are to be 
												delivered unto order and no 
												more'. Although in the above 
												passage it was the carrier whose 
												act of delivering the goods to 
												the person who had not been 
												named as a consignee that was in 
												issue, it seems to me 
												nonetheless that the above 
												extract of Amissah's judgment is 
												equally applicable here. In the 
												instant case the trial judge 
												ignored the purport of 'TO 
												ORDER' of the shipper and sought 
												to equate the person named in 
												the 'notify address' with the 
												consignee. It was entirely for 
												Cargill the shippers, to have 
												specified the consignee but they 
												opted to reserve to themselves 
												their right to order the 
												delivery of the rice to any 
												person whom they might name.' &quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Court of Appeal also relied 
												on the English case of Arnhold 
												Karberg &amp; Co. vrs. Blythe, 
												Green, Jourdain &amp; Co. (1915) 2 
												KB 379 at p. 387, where Scrutton 
												J. (as he then was) stated the 
												principle as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Where the seller by taking the 
												bills of lading in his name or 
												to his order has reserved the 
												jus disponendi or power of 
												dealing with the goods, the 
												property does not pass on 
												shipment, but it is vested in 
												the vendor until he receives 
												payment from the buyer in 
												exchange for the documents of 
												title. If the seller has taken 
												the bill of lading in the 
												purchaser's name, but retains it 
												as security to her price, the 
												property appears to vest on the 
												buyer's tendering the price.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Also in their judgment, the 
												Court of Appeal explained that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Cargill's failure to send any 
												Bills of Lading to the 
												Respondents [the Appellants 
												herein] and their substitution 
												of 'To Order' in place of a 
												named consignee, were of course 
												deliberate, as the evidence 
												showed.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												According to the judgment, the 
												purpose was the protection of 
												their financial interest; that 
												is, to ensure that the goods 
												were paid for. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In respect of the other 
												documents the Appellants 
												tendered in evidence in support 
												of their case, the Court of 
												Appeal had this to say:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;The Respondents tendered 
												documents in support of their 
												claim that they were the 
												consignees. These were:&nbsp; Invoice 
												from Cargill (Exh.B); 
												Phytosanitary Certificate 
												(Exh.C) and S.G.S. Clean Report 
												of Findings (Exh.D). The 
												documents do not prove the 
												Respondents&#8217; title to the goods. 
												They are no substitute for a 
												title document. They advance the 
												claim no further from where it 
												has been left marooned by the 
												available evidence.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is against this decision that 
												the 
												Plaintiffs/Respondents/Appellants 
												have appealed to this Court on 
												the grounds that the judgment is 
												against the weight of evidence, 
												and also that the costs awarded 
												are excessive. In paragraph 17 
												of the statement of case filed 
												on behalf of the Appellants, it 
												is stated as follows:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Nature and effect of a Bill of 
												Lading of goods.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Another point the subject matter 
												of this appeal is the question 
												about the legal nature and 
												effect of a Bill of Lading of 
												goods. The Court of Appeal 
												relied on the case of Arnhold 
												Karberg &amp; Co. vrs. Blythe, 
												Green, Jourdain &amp; Co. ... (see 
												supra). </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is submitted that this case 
												does not apply to the issues 
												involved in the present case. 
												The seller Cargill by the bill 
												of lading did not take the bills 
												of lading in his name or to his 
												order. In this case the bill of 
												lading was made to the order of 
												the consignee not to the 
												consignor or shipper.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In answer, the Respondents 
												herein, in their statement of 
												case, submitted, rightly in my 
												view, that </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;the main ground of appeal that 
												the judgment is against the 
												weight of evidence, is wholly 
												misconceived and frivolous, as 
												the inferences drawn by the 
												Court of Appeal in its judgment 
												are supported by oral and 
												documentary evidence in the two 
												volumes of the record of appeal. 
												There are serious misdirections 
												and wrong inferences made by the 
												learned trial judge from the 
												oral and documentary evidence on 
												the record of appeal.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Indeed, the Appellants' appeal 
												on the sole ground that the 
												Court of Appeal's decision is 
												against the weight of the 
												evidence adduced at the trial is 
												not only misconceived; it is 
												also very frivolous. And it is 
												most unfortunate for the 
												Appellants and or their Counsel 
												to state in their statement of 
												case that &#8220;The seller Cargill, 
												by the bill of lading did not 
												take the bills of lading in his 
												name or to his order.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												And that</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;in his case the bill of lading 
												was made to the order of the 
												consignee not to the consignor 
												or shipper.&#8221; (emphasis mine)</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is unfortunate because the 
												above submissions clearly 
												contradict paragraph 5 of the 
												Appellants' statement of claim, 
												quoted earlier, and their 
												exhibit &quot;A&#8221;, the bill of lading, 
												where it is stated that the 
												goods were made &#8220;to order&#8221;; that 
												is, to the order of the 
												consignor or the shipper. In the 
												circumstances, if any judgment 
												was against the weight of the 
												evidence, it was the judgment of 
												the trial High Court, and not 
												that of the Court of Appeal. As 
												I have indicated earlier, 
												therefore, having regard to the 
												averment in paragraph 5 of the 
												statement of claim, and the 
												evidence in the bill of lading, 
												exhibit &#8220;A&#8221;, the Appellants&#8217; 
												action was doomed to failure 
												from the very beginning.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the circumstances, I have no 
												hesitation at all in saying 
												without more that I find the 
												decision of the Court of Appeal 
												unassailable. Having regard to 
												the evidence and the law 
												applicable, I find the judgment 
												to be sound and ought not to be 
												disturbed. The appeal must 
												accordingly fail.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												ACQUAH J.S.C:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is an appeal against the 
												unanimous judgment of the Court 
												of Appeal which reversed that of 
												the trial High Court in a suit 
												wherein the plaintiff, Kaguin 
												Enterprise (Gh) Ltd. claimed 
												ownership of a consignment of 
												4,659.014 metric tonnes of rice 
												brought into this country by 
												Cargill International S.A. 
												Antigua in July 1989.&nbsp; The High 
												Court gave judgment for the 
												plaintiff but the Court of 
												Appeal set aside this judgment.
												</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The sole ground of appeal 
												levelled against the Court of 
												Appeal's judgment is that it is 
												against the weight of evidence. 
												Thus in the 
												plaintiff/appellant's notice of 
												appeal and further elaborated in 
												paragraph 13 of his statement of 
												case; it is stated: </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;13. The main ground of appeal 
												in this case is that the 
												judgment is against the weights 
												of the evidence alleged and 
												adduced in the case. We submit 
												that the crucial issues raised 
												in this appeal is the legal 
												inference to be drawn from the 
												oral and documentary evidence 
												adduced&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Since the only ground of appeal 
												is in respect of the weight of 
												evidence, it is instructive to 
												relate in detail the facts as 
												disclosed by the oral and 
												documentary evidence lead before 
												the trial court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The facts as borne out by 
												evidence were that Cargill 
												International S.A. Antigua 
												(hereinafter referred to as 
												&#8216;Kaguin&#8217;) was a worldwide 
												company with offices in many 
												countries. It dealt in grain 
												trading, transportation, 
												production of by-products, cocoa 
												and soyabean processing and 
												numerous other activities. 
												Kaguin Enterprise (Gh) Ltd., 
												(hereinafter referred to as 
												&#8216;Cargill&#8217;) was on the other hand 
												a limited liability company in 
												Ghana which at the material time 
												had one Mr. Edward Sane, a 
												Senegalese national, as its 
												majority shareholder and 
												managing director. This Edward 
												Sane had worked with Cargill 
												previously as a broker in Europe 
												and other West African 
												countries.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In February 1989, following the 
												liberalization of rice imports 
												in Ghana, Mr. Edward Sane 
												informed Cargill of new market 
												opportunities in this country. 
												Thereupon, officials of Cargill 
												made a visit to Ghana and met 
												G.N.P.A Customs, the Bank of 
												Ghana, and other Government 
												agencies. All these bodies 
												confirmed that the market had 
												indeed been liberalized, and 
												strongly encouraged Cargill to 
												supply rice to Ghana.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the strength of the above 
												favourable response, Cargill on 
												7th August, 1989 brought into 
												this country by its vessel 
												'Ocean Voice&#8217;, 4,659.014 metric 
												tonnes of rice accompanied by 47 
												bills of lading. Since Kaguin 
												had opened no letters of credit 
												nor made any arrangement for the 
												payment of any rice from 
												Cargill, the latter entered into 
												agreement with Umarco (Gh) Ltd. 
												to take delivery and guarantee 
												the security and condition of 
												this rice. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Umarco (Gh) Ltd., which had a 
												customs bonded warehouse, was 
												part of an international company 
												called SAGA Group in Paris with 
												whose branches Cargill had 
												engaged their service in many 
												countries.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Now paragraph 18B of this 
												Agreement between Cargill and 
												Umarco tendered at Exhibit 11 
												stated:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Umarco shall release to Kaguin 
												by consignment of a maximum of 
												700 metric tonnes. However, 
												before releasing a second 
												consignment Umarco shall obtain 
												the following proofs:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(1) Documentary evidence 
												attesting to the fact that 
												Customs duties have been paid 
												according to the current 
												authorized schedules/rates and 
												regulations applicable as to the 
												time of exit of the merchandise.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) Documentary evidence from a 
												Bank confirming the entry in 
												their account books of the value 
												of the merchandise in cedis and 
												an irrevocable commitment of the 
												bank to transfer its equivalent 
												in US Dollars to the credit of 
												Cargill&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the basis of the above 
												paragraph 18B of Exhibit 11 
												Umarco (Gh) Ltd. released 700 
												metric tonnes of rice to Kaguin 
												by endorsing seven bills of 
												lading to them. And the receipt 
												of this quantity of rice was 
												acknowledged by Kaguin in 
												paragraph 7 of their Statement 
												of Claim, as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;7. When the said consignment 
												arrived the defendant only 
												released 14000 bags of rice 
												weighing 700 metric tonnes to 
												the plaintiff&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												But up to date Kaguin had not 
												paid for the 700 metric tonnes 
												nor complied with the terms of 
												paragraph 18B of Exhibit 11.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Now sometime after receiving the 
												700 metric tonnes of rice, the 
												Deputy Managing Director of 
												Kaguin, in the person of Mr. 
												Kwaku Diawusie (who in fact 
												testified as Kaguin's 
												representative in this suit) in 
												a letter dated 26th September 
												1989 tendered as Exhibit 6, 
												began to complain first to the 
												auditors of Kaguin in respect of 
												what he described as illegal and 
												unauthorized acts of the 
												Managing Director, Edward Sane. 
												He followed this up with a 
												complaint on 9th November 1989 
												to the National Investigation 
												Committee (NIC). In that 
												complaint as borne out by 
												Exhibit 21, he accused Edward 
												Sane of, inter alia, involving 
												himself in retail trade in Ghana 
												by unilaterally selling 
												quantities of American long 
												grain rice which had been 
												imported into Ghana in breach of 
												the Ghana Investment Code.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the course of the NIC&#8217;s 
												investigation into this 
												complaint, two representatives 
												of Cargill came down from Geneva 
												and made a joint statement 
												explaining how Cargill came to 
												bring in the rice. In its 
												report, Exhibit 21, NIC found 
												inter alia that the rice were 
												neither imported by Edward Sane 
												nor Kaguin, and that the rice at 
												all material time in Ghana 
												remained the property of 
												Cargill. NIC therefore 
												recommended that Cargill be 
												allowed to direct Umarco as to 
												what to do with the remaining 
												quantity of rice in the bonded 
												warehouse. Cargill therefore 
												instructed Umarco (as borne out 
												by Exhibits 20 and 22) to 
												release the remaining bags of 
												rice for sale through FAABLIN 
												Ltd. Umarco accordingly released 
												the rice to Faablin Ltd.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Three years thereafter, Kwaku 
												Diawusie who had then become the 
												Managing Director and sole 
												shareholder of Kaguin Ltd., 
												instructed Solicitors to write 
												to Umarco demanding that the 
												latter account for the rice 
												which had already been disposed 
												of on the instructions of 
												Cargill and also demanded that 
												the proceeds of the said rice be 
												paid into its account. When 
												naturally, Umarco refused to 
												bulge to these demands, Kaguin, 
												on 11th February 1994 issued the 
												writ of summons in this appeal 
												at the Accra High Court against 
												Umarco, claiming:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												1. &quot;A declaration that the 
												plaintiff is the owner consignee 
												of 4,659.014 metric tonnes of 
												rice imported from Cargill 
												International S.A. Antigua in or 
												about July 1989.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												2. An order upon the defendant 
												to account to the plaintiff for 
												the 4659.014 metric tonnes or 
												the importation of the said 
												consignment disposed of by the 
												defendants.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												3. An order upon the defendant 
												to pay general damages for 
												conversion&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												At the trial the case of Kaguin 
												Ltd. was present by Mr. Kwaku 
												Diawusie who testified and 
												tendered a number of exhibits. 
												The defence of Umarco was 
												presented by three witnesses: 
												DW1 Lawyer Osa Mills who was 
												once a Solicitor for Kaguin 
												Ltd., DW2 Mr. Max Paillades, a 
												pensioner but was the Managing 
												Director of Umarco at the time 
												Umarco took delivery of the 
												rice; and DW3, Mr. C.O. Lamptey 
												the then Chairman of NIC. </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In its judgment, the trial High 
												Court found that Kaguin was the 
												importer of the rice and 
												therefore held that they were 
												the owners of the rice. The 
												court further held that since 
												Kaguin was not a party to the 
												agreement between Cargill and 
												Umarco, that agreement was 
												unlawful.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The court also accepted the 
												argument of the Kaguin that NIC 
												had no jurisdiction to 
												investigate the complaint lodged 
												by Kwaku Diawuasie. The count 
												therefore granted the plaintiff, 
												all its reliefs, 10,000,000 
												general damages with 3,000,000 
												costs. The judgment did not 
												disclose how the court arrived 
												at the 10,000,000 general 
												damages.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Court of Appeal on the other 
												hand, found that the agreement 
												between Cargill and Umarco was 
												valid, that NIC had jurisdiction 
												to go into the complaint brought 
												before it, and that the rice was 
												not imported by Kaguin but that 
												it remained the property of 
												Cargill in the possession of 
												Umarco. Accordingly the release 
												and sale of the remaining rice 
												by Umarco was upon the 
												instructions of Cargill. The 
												judgement of the High Court was 
												therefore set aside. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As said earlier, the case of 
												Kaguin was presented by Kwaku 
												Diawusie alone who testified and 
												tendered a number of Exhibits. 
												Of these exhibits, Kaguin relied 
												on A, B, C and D as evidencing 
												its ownership of the rice. 
												Exhibit A was the bill of lading 
												No. LC-47 on which the consignee 
												was &#8216;To Order&#8217; and the Notify 
												Address had the name and address 
												of Kaguin (Gh) Ltd.; Exhibit B 
												was a temporary invoice from 
												Cargill to Kaguin on the rice, 
												dated 15th June 1989; Exhibit C 
												was a Photosanitary Certificate; 
												while Exhibit D was an SGS Clean 
												Report findings.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Now exhibit 11, the agreement 
												between Cargill and Umarco (Gh) 
												Ltd. had no date on it, and 
												therefore difficult for one to 
												determine when it was made &#8212; 
												that is whether it was made 
												before the rice came in or 
												thereafter. However, the 
												evidence established that the 
												700 metric tons of rice released 
												to Kaguin by Umarco (Gh) Ltd. 
												was done in accordance with 
												paragraph 18B of the said 
												agreement. Again Lawyer Nii Osa 
												Mills who testified for Umarco 
												as DW1, and was once the 
												solicitor for Kaguin and Mr. 
												Edward Sane, said that he was 
												aware of the existence of this 
												agreement before he represented 
												them at the NIC investigations. 
												He said:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;I was aware of the existence of 
												this agreement before I went to 
												NIC&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Paragraph 5 of this Exhibit 11 
												stated:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Cargill shall send to Umarco 
												Tema copy of its temporary trade 
												invoice drawn on Kaguin Ghana 
												covering cost, insurance, 
												freight value to Tema of the 
												merchandise shipped&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Hence, the temporary or 
												provisional invoice, Exhibit B. 
												And the import of such an 
												invoice as explained in Vol. 34 
												of the 3rd edition of Halbury&#8217;s 
												Laws of England, page 171, is:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;A provisional invoice, if sent 
												is no more than an intimation of 
												the way in which the sellers 
												intend to perform their 
												contract, and may merely be an 
												intimation of the way in which 
												the sellers are willing, as a 
												concession, to perform&quot;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												From the terms of Exhibit 11 and 
												the fact that Kaguin had made no 
												provision nor indicated as to 
												how it would pay for the 
												consignment it is too plain and 
												commonsensical that Exhibit B 
												was intended to be nothing more 
												than what is quoted above from 
												Halsbury's Laws. It never vested 
												ownership of the rice in Kaguin.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Exhibit C, the photosanitary 
												certificate was evidence of the 
												fact that the rice had been 
												inspected according to the 
												appropriate procedures of the 
												importing country. While exhibit 
												D, the SGS clean report findings 
												also evidenced that the rice 
												were shipped according to the 
												import requirements of Ghana in 
												terms of quantity, quality and 
												price.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Now although Kaguin was 
												described on Exhibit B, C and D 
												as the importer of the rice, 
												these three documents do not 
												constitute the shipping 
												documents, delivery of which to 
												the buyer is symbolic of 
												delivery of the goods to the 
												buyer. In other words, these 
												three documents do not 
												constitute documents of title 
												enabling the buyer to take 
												delivery of the goods. </span>

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In a C.I.F. contract, as

												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The bills of lading accompanying 
												the rice in dispute were all 
												consigned &#8216;To Order&#8217; and not to 
												Kaguin. The particulars of 
												Kaguin appeared at the Notify 
												address column.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In export trade and as confirmed 
												by section 61(e) of Act 137, a 
												bill of lading is the evidence 
												of the title and of the goods 
												shipped, and by its endorsement 
												and delivery the transfer of the 
												possession, and also of the 
												property in the goods is 
												effected.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												All the bills of lading on the 
												rice came into the hands of 
												Umarco (Gh) Ltd. by which Umarco 
												had authority to take delivery 
												of the rice. As pleaded by 
												Kaguin in paragraph 5 of its 
												Statement of Case. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;5. The defendants were shipping 
												agents, and were in receipt of 
												the Bill of Lading, which stated 
												that the plaintiff was the party 
												to be notified of the arrival of 
												the rice, and the consignee of 
												the said goods was 'To Order'.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Indeed section 7(1) of the 
												Billing of Lading Act 1961 (Act 
												42) states: </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Every consignee of goods named 
												in a Bill of Lading and every 
												endorsee of a Bill of Lading to 
												whom the property in goods 
												therein mentioned passes under 
												the contract in pursuance of 
												which the endorsement was made 
												shall have transferred to and 
												vested in him all rights, and be 
												subject to the same liabilities 
												in respect of the goods as if 
												the contract expressed in the 
												Bill of Lading had been made 
												with himself&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Kaguin was not the consignee in 
												the Bill of Lading Exhibit A. 
												Kaguin was designated in the 
												'Notify Party' column and this 
												does not make Kaguin the 
												consignee. Thus as Amissah J.A's 
												in C.I.L.E.V. vrs. Black Star 
												Line Ltd. &amp; Anor. (1968) G.L.R 
												480 at 485 to 486 explained:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&quot;Where a person unto whom it is 
												stated in this part that the 
												goods are shipped differs from 
												the one given in the 'notify 
												address', I cannot conceive the 
												name given in that notify 
												address being by any stretch of 
												the imagination described as the 
												consignee. It is simple common 
												sense that the consignee of good 
												is the person to whom the goods 
												are sent and not necessarily the 
												address to be notified of the 
												arrival of goods at its 
												predestined port. All that the 
												'notify address' means to me is 
												that if the address given is 
												notified of the arrival of the 
												goods the person to whom they 
												are consigned or to whom they 
												ought to be delivered will come 
												forward to take delivery of 
												them.&quot;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is often said that a c.i.f. 
												contract is not the sale of the 
												goods themselves but a sale of 
												the documents relating to the 
												goods. This is because in such a 
												contract the delivery of the 
												shipping documents to the buyer 
												is deemed as delivery and for 
												that matter property and risk 
												thereon passes to him. Thus the 
												method of payment under a c.i.f. 
												contract is for the&nbsp; buyer to 
												pay to the seller the price of 
												the goods in cash upon delivery 
												of the shipping documents. Of 
												course, the parties may also 
												agree that payment shall be made 
												by the buyer by acceptance of a 
												bill of exchange against 
												delivery of the shipping 
												documents. In such a case the 
												bill of exchange drawn by the 
												seller upon the buyer is 
												forwarded to the buyer with the 
												other documents, and the 
												property in the goods does not 
												pass unless the buyer upon 
												presentation of the documents 
												accepts the bill of exchange. 
												Payment is also frequently made 
												by means of a confirmed credit. 
												Thus section 63 of the Sale of 
												Goods Act 1962 (Act 137) 
												provides:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;63. Where in a c.i.f. or f.o.b. 
												contract the price is to be paid 
												by means of a letter of credit 
												opened at a bank to be nominated 
												by the seller, then in the 
												absence of a contrary intention&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												a) the credit must be opened not 
												later than the earliest date on 
												which the seller may ship the 
												goods, or where the date of 
												shipment is to be fixed by the 
												buyer, not later than the 
												earlier date on which the seller 
												may be required to ship the 
												goods;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												b) as against the buyer, the 
												seller is only entitled to draw 
												against the credit on 
												presentation to the bank of 
												proper shipping documents.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Which of these methods of 
												payment, or indeed any method of 
												payment, did Kaguin adopt in the 
												importation of the rice which it 
												claims in his suit to be the 
												importer and owner thereof? None 
												whatsoever!</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is indeed the practice of 
												shippers to protect their 
												interest when a consignment has 
												not been paid for to hold on to 
												the commodity and allow it to 
												remain their property by 
												inserting in the consignees 
												column &#8216;To Order&#8217; as was done in 
												the instant case. And by 
												inserting &#8216;to order&#8217;, Cargill 
												was to direct the one to whom 
												the rice were to be delivered. 
												If Cargill had intended Kaguin 
												to be the consignee they would 
												have inserted Kaguin&#8217;s name in 
												that column.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												From the terms of the agreement 
												Exhibit 11, it was evident that 
												because Kaguin had not paid a 
												pesewa nor opened any letters of 
												credit for the purchase of the 
												rice, Cargill was mindful of 
												ensuring that any quantity of 
												rice delivered to Kaguin on 
												their instructions was paid for 
												before further quantities were 
												released to them.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												And as the evidence clearly 
												established, the first 700 
												metric tonnes of rice, released 
												to Kaguin on the instructions of 
												Cargill in accordance with 
												Exhibit 11 had up to date not 
												been paid for. The plaintiff&#8217;s 
												representative, Mr. Kwaku 
												Diawusie admitted this while 
												under cross-examination:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;No I did not pay Cargill the 
												cost of rice allocated to us&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Indeed throughout the entire 
												trial, Kaguin who claims to be 
												the importer/owner of the&nbsp; 
												entire rice, never led a shred 
												of evidence on the terms on 
												which Kaguin agreed with Cargill 
												to pay for the goods. He made no 
												cash payment nor opened any 
												letters of credit. Experienced 
												traders like Cargill therefore 
												would not consign their goods to 
												unsecured importer like Kaguin. 
												Hence the precaution they took 
												in engaging Umarco to store and 
												guarantee the security and 
												condition of the rice.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the whole, one cannot help 
												but discern some incongruity on 
												the part of Kaguin in this 
												action, especially on the part 
												of Kwaku Diawusie who described 
												himself in his evidence as</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;&#8230; the sole shareholder and 
												director in the 
												plaintiff/company&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is the man who according to 
												Exhibit 20, the NIC report, had 
												complained that</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;Edward Sane, even though a 
												foreigner, had involved himself 
												in the retail trade in Ghana by 
												unilaterally selling quantities 
												of American long grain rice 
												which have been imported into 
												Ghana in breach of the Ghana 
												Investment Code&#8221;. (emphasis 
												mine)</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is this same rice which he 
												now claims in this action to 
												belong to his company, Kaguin, 
												at a time he had succeed in 
												throwing out Edward Sane from 
												the company. Can he now allege 
												that the rice was properly 
												imported by his company?</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Next, by the report of the NIC, 
												which Kwaku Diawusie was fully 
												aware, the NIC found the rice to 
												belong to Cargill and permitted 
												it to direct Umarco to release 
												it for sale. This was 
												accordingly done. Again Cargill 
												shipped the entire rice 
												consignment into the warehouse 
												of Umarco (Gh) Ltd. and not to 
												Kaguin. If indeed Kaguin 
												genuinely believed that they 
												imported the rice, why did they 
												not direct their action against 
												Cargill which had obviously 
												refused to deliver the rice to 
												them. Umarco only acted as the 
												agent of Cargill. And this fact 
												of agency was not unknown to 
												Kaguin. This action against 
												Umarco when the facts fully 
												disclose that Cargill had all 
												along exercised control and 
												ownership of the rice in Ghana, 
												clearly testifies to the 
												emptiness of Kaguin&#8217;s action. 
												Throughout the whole of his 
												evidence, Kwaku Diawusie never 
												set out the terms on which 
												Kaguin allegedly imported the 
												rice.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												On the facts, this action by 
												Kaguin against Umarco is 
												misdirected and certainly in bad 
												faith. The proper person to sue 
												if Kaguin has any genuine case, 
												is Cargill and not Umarco (Gh) 
												Ltd.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Accordingly, I find that the 
												judgment of the court of Appeal 
												is impeccable and fully 
												supported by the evidence. The 
												appeal therefore ought to be and 
												is hereby dismissed.</span></p>

												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The question is: When is there 
												delivery of goods on boardship? 
												That may be quite different from 
												delivery of goods on shore. The 
												answer is that delivery of the 
												bill of lading when goods are at 
												sea may be treated as delivery 
												of the goods themselves. That is 
												so old and so well established 
												that it is unnecessary to refer 
												to authorities on the subject.&#8221; 
												(emphasis supplied)</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												It is therefore clear that in 
												order to gain possession of or 
												title to goods shipped under a 
												bill of lading one must be the 
												holder of the bill of lading. 
												But that means a holder as 
												consignee or endorsee thereof. 
												In this case even if the 
												Appellant came by the bill of 
												lading he was not the consignee 
												or endorsee in any manner 
												entitling him to the goods 
												thereof. He was plainly on the 
												face of the bill of lading, 
												which is the dominant document 
												in C.I.F. shipments, as in this 
												case, holder of a notify 
												address. That does not give him 
												title or possession of the 
												goods. That has been settled in 
												C.I.L.E.V. VS. BLACK STAR LINE 
												LTD. (1968) GLR 480, PAN AFRICAN

												instances in which the bill of 
												lading will be ineffective in 
												the hands of an indorsed holder, 
												as where the vendor or shipper 
												lacked title to the goods ab 
												initio. But that is not so in 
												this case.</span></p>
