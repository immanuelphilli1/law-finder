                                              developments since Alvid Pardo's

                                              seas: it allocates resource rights 
                                              to coastal states while 
                                              guaranteeing at the same time 
                                              navigational rights of all other 
                                              states.</span></p>

                                              The EEZ concept evolved as a 
                                              viable compromise between 
                                              extremist states who would like to 
                                              exercise wide jurisdictional 
                                              rights over the seas and moderate

                                              navigational interests, amongst 
                                              other things.</span></p>

                                              The juridical nature of the EEZ 
                                              has been a subject of controversy 
                                              particularly in its formative 
                                              years. Some states perceive the 
                                              EEZ as the high seas whilst others 
                                              see it as the territorial sea. The 
                                              EEZ is neither; in fact it is a 
                                              zone sui generis; and although 
                                              certain jurists see this 
                                              controversy as now purely of 
                                              academic interests1 in view of the 
                                              provisions of the United Nations 
                                              Convention on the Law of the Sea,2 
                                              an examination of the subject is 
                                              still worthwhile for a number of 
                                              reasons: The provisions on the EEZ 
                                              are scattered throughout the 
                                              Convention; and in some cases do 
                                              not lend themselves to easy 
                                              comprehension and/or 
                                              interpretation. Besides, there is 
                                              no uniformity and/or consistency 
                                              of state practices including 
                                              legislation on the subject. An 
                                              analysis of the subject therefore 
                                              is thus necessary so as to put 
                                              issues in the right perspective. 
                                              This is all the more important in 
                                              view of the fact that the 
                                              Convention requires only thirteen 
                                              more ratifications to come into 
                                              force.3 In any event, even if the 
                                              Convention does not come into 
                                              force the EEZ concept is now 
                                              widely recognised as part of 
                                              customary international law.4&nbsp; 
                                              Furthermore, for states like Ghana 
                                              that have ratified the Convention, 
                                              the latter is the norm or 
                                              benchmark against which the 
                                              validity or otherwise of their

                                              legislation on the EEZ reveals 
                                              certain shortcomings that ought to 
                                              be rectified in line with our

                                              The purpose of this paper is thus 
                                              two-fold: First, to provide an 
                                              insight into the EEZ concept as an 
                                              institution of international law. 
                                              Secondly, in the light of the 
                                              analysis, assess existing Ghanaian 
                                              legislation to ascertain the 
                                              extent to which our national

                                              conventional obligations. The 
                                              ensuing discussion, it is hoped, 
                                              would help throw further light on 
                                              the EEZ concept and the nature of 
                                              the various competencies that may 
                                              be exercised by Ghana in the light 
                                              of UNCLOS.5</span></p>

                                              The roots of the EEZ concept lies 
                                              in President Truman of the United 
                                              States' Proclamation of 1945 (the 
                                              Truman Proclamation).6 In the 
                                              Proclamation, the US asserted 
                                              jurisdiction over the resources of 
                                              its continental shelf. The 
                                              Proclamation however made it clear 
                                              that the US did not intend to 
                                              affect the character as high seas 
                                              of the waters above the 
                                              continental shelf and their right 
                                              to free and unimpeded navigation. 
                                              It was this Proclamation, made in 
                                              the wake of the discovery of 
                                              hydrocarbons in the US continental 
                                              shelf then, that initiated the 
                                              functional approach to 
                                              jurisdiction into the seas. 
                                              Indeed, it would be difficult to 
                                              deny that the claim by the US in 
                                              respect of the non-living 
                                              resources if the continental shelf 
                                              was a claim to an economic zone of 
                                              exclusive coastal state 
                                              jurisdiction.7 The proclamation 
                                              became an attractive precedent 
                                              especially for the Latin American 
                                              states who followed suit with 
                                              sometimes contradictory and even 
                                              fantastic claims.8 Eventually, by 
                                              the Santo Domingo Declaration of 
                                              1972 the concept of &quot;patrimonial 
                                              sea&quot; was accepted by the majority 
                                              of the Latin American states as 
                                              representing their view on the 
                                              subject. This gave the states 
                                              rights to assert jurisdiction up 
                                              to 200 miles from the baselines; 
                                              twelve miles of territorial seas 
                                              and the remainder an external 
                                              patrimonial sea zone for resource 
                                              control subject to the exercise of 
                                              high seas freedoms like navigation 
                                              and overflight.</span></p>

                                              Of course this expansion of 
                                              states' sovereignty into the seas 
                                              was a source of worry for maritime 
                                              states like Great Britain who 
                                              viewed same as an infringement of 
                                              navigational rights and stuck to a 
                                              conservative 3-mile limit as 
                                              representing their view on the 
                                              subject. There were unsuccessful 
                                              attempts by the United Nations — 
                                              the First and Second UN 
                                              Conferences on the Law of the Sea 
                                              in 1958 and 1960 respectively — to 
                                              resolve the issue of the breadth 
                                              of the territorial sea. It was the 
                                              Third UN Conference on the Law of 
                                              the Sea,9 that was to resolve the 
                                              issue of the breadth of the 
                                              territorial sea and nurture into 
                                              fruition the EEZ. What was finally 
                                              agreed upon in the Convention is 
                                              an EEZ area starting at the outer 
                                              edge of the territorial sea and 
                                              extending up to a limit of 200 
                                              miles from the baseline where the 
                                              territorial sea is measured. From 
                                              there, coastal states enjoy 
                                              sovereign rights to the resources 
                                              of the sea bed, of the subsoil and 
                                              of the superjacent waters as well 
                                              as jurisdiction with regard to 
                                              maritime scientific research, 
                                              environmental preservation and the 
                                              establishment of artificial 
                                              islands, installations and 
                                              structures. Interwoven with these 
                                              rights of the coastal states are 
                                              the rights of all other states to 
                                              the enjoyment of the traditional 
                                              high seas freedoms of navigation, 
                                              overflight and the laying of 
                                              submarine cables and pipelines.10 
                                              The 200 miles right enures to 
                                              states without the requirement of 
                                              any proof of any special 
                                              circumstances. There is however 
                                              the requirement for a formal 
                                              declaration of such a zone unlike,

                                              a whole. This proposal was 
                                              attractive, and received the 
                                              active support, especially of the 
                                              developing states who, lacking the 
                                              technology to exploit the area by 
                                              themselves, saw in it a means of 
                                              sharing in the wealth of the 
                                              oceans. A number of resolutions on 
                                              the question of the reservation of 
                                              the sea bed and ocean floor 
                                              exclusively for peaceful purposes 
                                              and the use of their resources in 
                                              the interest of mankind as a whole 
                                              were adopted. By Resolution 2340 
                                              (XXII), the UNGA established an ad

                                              peaceful uses of the sea bed and 
                                              the ocean floor beyond the limits 
                                              of national jurisdiction.</span></p>

                                              the problems of the seas were 
                                              closely interrelated and thus

                                              of a convention dealing with all

                                              were not only states (numbering 57 
                                              at the close of the conference),

                                              The EEZ concept originated in

                                              research, is also subject to the 
                                              jurisdiction of coastal states. 
                                              Perhaps the only important high 
                                              seas freedom left in the EEZ is 
                                              freedom of navigation; but even 
                                              here, coastal state enforcement of

                                              The EEZ in its origin was dictated 
                                              mainly by economic considerations 
                                              devoid of any pretences to state 
                                              sovereignty. In this, it differs 
                                              from the territorial seas whose 
                                              evolution was motivated by 
                                              security considerations. Under the 
                                              1958 Convention on the Territorial 
                                              Seas, state sovereignty over the 
                                              airspace, over the territorial sea

                                              was recognised, albeit the 
                                              Convention failed to establish the 
                                              breadth of the zone. This was made 
                                              subject to &quot;innocent passage&quot; 
                                              couched in terms of its being

                                              The Convention establishes a

                                              development is the trend towards 
                                              international standards of 
                                              enforcement: pollution must be

                                              These rights are to be exercised 
                                              under the provisions on the 
                                              continental shelf; which is the

                                              state does not explore or exploit

                                              Article 56 also grants coastal

                                              is the sole preserve of the

                                              would prevent over-exploitation;

                                              resources of the EEZ. It is 
                                              however enjoined to permit other 
                                              states access to the surplus of 
                                              the allowable catch when it does

                                              surplus of the allowable catch can 
                                              be gained only through

                                              states. The coastal state is 
                                              enjoined to do so having regard to 
                                              articles 69 and 70 which grant

                                              coastal state should be guided by

                                              to the economy of the coastal

                                              It is important to note that the 
                                              determination of the total

                                              Even though the coastal state is

                                              in the exploitation of the

                                              that a coastal state refuses other 
                                              states access to her surpluses in 
                                              the EEZ. Being no more than

                                              are inherently weak and cannot

                                              tried and punished by its domestic 
                                              courts. However, states do not 
                                              have unfettered rights and/or 
                                              discretion as to the mode of 
                                              exercise of their criminal 
                                              jurisdiction. Indeed, the 
                                              Convention imposes limitations as 
                                              to the nature and/or type of 
                                              punishment that may be meted out 
                                              to a vessel and/or its crew who 
                                              are apprehended for violating a 
                                              coastal state's fisheries laws. 
                                              Article 73, the relevant provision 
                                              on the subject, provides that 
                                              arrested vessels and their crew 
                                              shall be promptly released upon 
                                              the posting of reasonable bond or 
                                              other security. In addition, 
                                              penalties for such violations may 
                                              not include imprisonment, in the 
                                              absence of agreement to the 
                                              contrary by the states concerned; 
                                              or any other form of corporal 
                                              punishment.</span></p>

                                              The Convention further obliges 
                                              coastal states to promptly notify 
                                              the flag state, through 
                                              appropriate channels, of the 
                                              action taken and of any penalties 
                                              subsequently imposed. In its 
                                              judicial proceedings, the coastal 
                                              state is obliged to impose 
                                              financial penalties only and to 
                                              refrain from any or unnecessary 
                                              detention of a vessel or its crew. 
                                              The Convention does not provide 
                                              for the amount of financial 
                                              penalties that may be imposed. The 
                                              matter is within the competence of 
                                              the coastal state. The coastal 
                                              state also has jurisdiction, as 
                                              noted, over the establishment of

                                              fisheries, a decision by a coastal 
                                              state to order suspension or

                                              The Convention also grants coastal

                                              At independence, Ghana inherited

                                              existing IMO treaties of 1954, 
                                              1973 and to future IMO treaties; 
                                              this was not contradicted.49 Prior

                                              pollution standards was generally 
                                              limited to the territorial seas. 
                                              On the high seas, the 
                                              responsibility was that of flag

                                              enforcement. In addition, it 
                                              introduces port and coastal state

                                              The most important and also the 
                                              most controversial of the 
                                              safeguard provisions is the 
                                              flag-state pre-emption clause.54 
                                              This provision enables flag-states 
                                              to suspend proceedings instituted 
                                              by coastal or port-states within 
                                              six months of the institution of 
                                              such proceedings and to undertake 
                                              its own proceedings. This 
                                              provision must, however, not be 
                                              viewed as detracting from the 
                                              regime. The rationale behind the 
                                              rule is that before allowing 
                                              coastal or port-state to take 
                                              proceedings and impose penalties 
                                              on foreign vessels, the flag-state 
                                              should be given reasonable 
                                              opportunity to exercise its 
                                              enforcement rights and carry out 
                                              its obligations which are directly 
                                              derived from the relation of the 
                                              ship to this state.55</span></p>

                                              As formulated, the provision is 
                                              not an immutable precept that 
                                              allows flag-states to pre-empt 
                                              proceedings anyhow. The right of 
                                              pre-emption does not apply in the 
                                              case of &quot;major damage.&quot; What 
                                              amounts to a major damage is not 
                                              defined. Hence a coastal state 
                                              could deny a flag-state 
                                              pre-emption rights on the ground 
                                              that the polluting vessel’s damage 
                                              amounts to “major damage.” 
                                              Secondly, it does not apply where 
                                              a flag-state has repeatedly 
                                              disregarded its enforcement 
                                              obligations. A flag-state that 
                                              “pre-empts” proceedings without 
                                              imposing any sanctions on its 
                                              vessels could find itself being 
                                              denied this right in subsequent 
                                              proceedings involving its vessels. 
                                              This is more so since flag-states 
                                              are obliged to inform coastal or 
                                              port-states of the outcome of such 
                                              proceedings. Above all, states 
                                              parties would have to ensure that 
                                              their legislation conform with the 
                                              Convention’s texts.&nbsp; So long as 
                                              the rules, especially penalties 
                                              are uniform, flag-state 
                                              pre-emption pales into 
                                              insignificance.56</span></p>

                                              Flag states are also to adopt laws 
                                              and regulations and to take 
                                              measures to ensure that vessels 
                                              flying their flags comply with 
                                              such request.</span></p>

                                              Admittedly, the success of the 
                                              system depends on co-operation 
                                              between states, but in view of the 
                                              global nature of the pollution 
                                              problem, there is every incentive 
                                              for states to collectively act 
                                              against it; and also in fulfilment 
                                              of their Convention obligations. 
                                              In addition, where there is &quot;clear 
                                              objective evidence&quot; that a 
                                              violation has resulted in 
                                              &quot;discharge causing a major damage 
                                              or threat of major damage&quot; to the 
                                              EEZ or its resources, the coastal 
                                              state may institute proceedings 
                                              including detention of the vessel 
                                              in accordance with its laws 
                                              (article 220(6)). In this 
                                              connection, it may exercise the 
                                              right of hot pursuit. The 
                                              Convention neither defines &quot;clear 
                                              grounds&quot;, &quot;objective evidence&quot;, 
                                              nor &quot;substantial discharge.&quot; 
                                              Presumably, it leaves that for the 
                                              determination of coastal states. 
                                              In view of the rights that these 
                                              states have over the resources of 
                                              the zone, and in spite of the 
                                              circumscribed nature of coastal 
                                              state enforcement powers, there is 
                                              immense potential for coastal 
                                              states to determine these 
                                              standards in such a manner as to 
                                              enable them exercise greater 
                                              enforcement powers than the 
                                              Convention's stipulation in the 
                                              name of resource conservation.</span></p>

                                              The Convention's environmental 
                                              protection and preservation 
                                              provisions are made subject to the 
                                              &quot;sovereign immunity&quot; provisions 
                                              under article 236.59 The issue of 
                                              immunity was not extensively 
                                              discussed at UNCLOS; the 
                                              Convention follows the example of 
                                              other existing treaties by 
                                              granting immunity to such vessels. 
                                              Under article 236, warships, naval 
                                              auxiliary as well as other vessels 
                                              or aircraft owned or operated by a 
                                              state and used on government 
                                              non-commercial service are 
                                              exempted from coastal states 
                                              enforcement jurisdiction. In this 
                                              wise, the Convention adopts the 
                                              restrictive immunity doctrine 
                                              under international law.&nbsp; It must 
                                              however be emphasised that the 
                                              immunity is from arrest and 
                                              prosecution and not immunity from 
                                              liability.60 Consequently, such 
                                              vessels are legally obliged under 
                                              article 236 to comply with the 
                                              Convention’s texts.&nbsp; Provision of 
                                              immunity under article 236 is thus

                                              by the fact that certain vital

                                              the high seas, nor the territorial 
                                              seas; but a zone sui generis of 
                                              multifunctional competence.&nbsp; It is 
                                              a cause championed especially by 
                                              developing states like Ghana who 
                                              see resources in the zone as 
                                              constituting an important basis 
                                              for socio-economic development. 
                                              Virtually all these states had 
                                              been colonies of the Western 
                                              powers. Independence meant their 
                                              ability to do away with the 
                                              conservative territorial sea 
                                              breadths of their colonial masters 
                                              in order to increase their wealth 
                                              from the seas. The pre-UNCLOS 
                                              regime of territorial/high sea 
                                              dichotomy was not a suitable 
                                              medium for the attainment of these 
                                              objectives. The notion of high 
                                              seas meant that all states had 
                                              rights to the resources of the 
                                              area whilst an expansion of the 
                                              territorial sea out to 200 miles 
                                              meant an infringement of 
                                              navigational rights which the 
                                              maritime states were not 
                                              predisposed to accept. The EEZ 
                                              emerged as a compromise aimed at 
                                              accommodating the two interests.</span></p>

                                              in state practice on the matter.

                                              Convention would be to engender 
                                              the required uniformity so as to

                                              state, whilst all other states 
                                              have the necessary communication

                                              championed by Ghana and other 
                                              developing states is now a

                                              international law. The resources 
                                              of the EEZ, properly explored, 
                                              exploited and conserved, should be

                                              potentials of our EEZ. I propose

                                              (1) There is the need to have the 
                                              EEZ firmly established. 
                                              Legislation per se is not 
                                              sufficient. This must be 
                                              accompanied by the provision of 
                                              charts or scales showing the outer 
                                              limits of the EEZ so that the same 
                                              can be ascertained.&nbsp; Due publicity 
                                              of these charts should be given to 
                                              the international community and 
                                              copies of the same should be 
                                              lodged with the United Nations.68 
                                              We need also to delimit our EEZ 
                                              with our adjacent neighbouring 
                                              states. Indications are that 
                                              hydrocarbons do exist in 
                                              commercial quantities in the 
                                              western part of our EEZ. There is 
                                              thus the need to demarcate our 
                                              borders with our neighbours so as 
                                              to avoid the potential of a 
                                              conflict in the future.69</span></p>

                                              (2) We should create the necessary 
                                              legal and institutional frameworks 
                                              for the exploration, exploitation

                                              in our EEZ. A beginning has been 
                                              made by the Fisheries and 
                                              Petroleum Laws. These, however, 
                                              have to be modified and/or updated 
                                              to be in line with the 
                                              Convention's stipulations which 
                                              are the norms or benchmark against 
                                              which the validity or otherwise of 
                                              such legislations may be assessed. 
                                              In this regard, our laws on the 
                                              protection of the marine 
                                              environment require a drastic 
                                              overhaul to be in conformity with 
                                              the IMO and other international 
                                              convenants on the subject. There 
                                              is also the requirement for 
                                              national legislation on the 
                                              various aspects of the EEZ such as 
                                              scientific research, navigation 
                                              and the construction of artificial

                                              prepared to devote some of our 
                                              limited resources towards the 
                                              policing of our EEZ. In this 
                                              regard, the unit ought to be made 
                                              functional through the provision 
                                              of the requisite tools for its 
                                              functions. This is admittedly an 
                                              expensive venture. However, the 
                                              long terms benefits are certainly 
                                              worthwhile: a check on poaching 
                                              and pollution in our EEZ would 
                                              mean conservation of our living 
                                              resources. Besides, the fines 
                                              imposed on arrested poachers could 
                                              be a valuable source of funding 
                                              for the operations of the unit.</span></p>

                                              national frontiers. Similarly, 
                                              fisheries cannot be confined in a

                                              national legislation lay claims to

                                              are inconsistent with the 
                                              Convention's texts. Nigeria, a 
                                              party to the Convention, for 
                                              instance, has declared a 30

                                              This, by implication, does affect 
                                              the status of a belt of 17

                                              respectively.&nbsp; MARPOL 73/78 
                                              imposes an absolute prohibition on 
                                              oil discharge in special areas.&nbsp; 
                                              The Convention also requires state 
                                              parties to provide adequate 
                                              facilities for the reception of 
                                              oily mixtures in places like 
                                              loading terminals and ports. In 
                                              addition, it provides that oil 
                                              tankers must be equipped with 
                                              facilities like slop tanks, oily 
                                              water separating equipment, or

                                              The latter helps detect the amount 
                                              of oil discharged by vessels upon 
                                              inspection. MARPOL 73/78 also 
                                              retains the limitations on tank 
                                              size imposed by the 1971 amendment 
                                              to OILPOL 54. Furthermore, it 
                                              requires all new oil tankers of 
                                              20,000 tons dead weight and above 
                                              to be provided with segregated 
                                              ballast tanks (SBTS) of sufficient 
                                              capacity to enable them to operate 
                                              on ballast voyages without using 
                                              cargo tanks for ballast purposes; 
                                              and since SBTS are not used for 
                                              carrying oil, there are no oily 
                                              mixtures and hence no pollution. 
                                              Provision is also made for crude 
                                              oil washing (COW) as an 
                                              alternative requirement in SBTS on 
                                              existing tankers, and is an 
                                              additional requirement for new 
                                              tankers. Under COW, tanks are 
                                              washed with crude oil and not with 
                                              water. The crude oil's solvent 
                                              action makes the cleaning process 
                                              far more effective than when water 
                                              is used. Besides, there is no 
                                              mixture of the oil and water that 
                                              caused so much operational 
                                              pollution in the past. The system, 
                                              however, poses operational dangers 
                                              because of the attendant build-up 
                                              of explosive gases in cargo tanks. 
                                              It is for this reason that the 
                                              SOLAS 74 protocol prescribes the 
                                              use of inert gas systems on such 
                                              vessels. To ensure that tankers in 
                                              the event of accidents survive 
                                              bottom damage, MARPOL 73/78 has 
                                              introduced new subdivision and 
                                              stability requirements based on 
                                              ship lengths. There is the 
                                              requirement for an initial survey 
                                              before a ship is put into service 
                                              or before an IOPCC is issued, as 
                                              well as periodical surveys of 
                                              vessels at intervals not exceeding 
                                              five years. The application of 
                                              MARPOL 73/78's technical 
                                              requirements to “new tankers” has 
                                              meant that most vessels ordered 
                                              since December 1975 have 
                                              incorporated the requirements of
