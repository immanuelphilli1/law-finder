												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												AFREH, J.S.C.:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This is an Appeal against the 
												judgment of the Court of Appeal 
												dated 15th April, 1999 
												dismissing the Appellant&#8217;s 
												appeal against the decision of 
												the High Court dated 17th May, 
												1995.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The appellant relied on and 
												argued eight grounds of appeal. 
												But they can reduced to three 
												main grounds:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(i) That the judgments of the 
												High Court and the Court of 
												Appeal were null and void 
												because they were delivered 
												after the statutory periods 
												within which they should have 
												been given.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(ii) That the Court of Appeal 
												erred in treating as evidence 
												two invoices attached to the 
												statement of claim.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(iii) That the Court of Appeal 
												erred in holding that lawyer 
												Archampong had capacity to 
												institute proceedings on behalf 
												of the plaintiffs as plaintiffs&#8217; 
												attorney.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The claim of the plaintiff 
												(plaintiffs) was for </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(a) The sum of USD 50,733.90 
												being balance of debt due and 
												owing by the defendants to the 
												plaintiff in respect of two 
												separate merchantile 
												transactions.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(b) Interest on the said amount 
												at commercial or bank rate with 
												effect from 1st January, 1988 to 
												the date of judgment.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The defendants also 
												counter-claimed from the 
												plaintiffs rent at the rate of 
												¢25,000.00 per year from 31st 
												October, 1987.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												According to the plaintiffs, who 
												were a firm of international 
												traders in the U.S.A., on 2nd 
												September, 1987 they conveyed 
												and sold to the defendants by 
												sea freight, a consignment of 
												38,491 pairs of used olive green 
												shorts at the price of USD 1.20 
												a pair, 25 pairs of soccer boots 
												at USD 1.00 a pair, bringing the 
												total price of the goods to USD 
												46,214.20. Also, on 5th October 
												1989, they sold and conveyed to 
												the defendants, 1280 cartons of 
												sundry biscuits valued at USD 
												15,208. As at the time 
												plaintiffs instituted the 
												instant action the defendants 
												had paid USD 20,088 of the total 
												value of the goods and later USD 
												4,000.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Defendants did not dispute 
												the plaintiffs&#8217; claim relating 
												to the second consignment of 
												goods, but they contended the 
												first consignment of used olive 
												green shorts was not sold to 
												them but sent to them on 
												sell-or-return basis and 
												therefore they remain the 
												property of the plaintiffs and 
												were being kept in the 
												defendants&#8217; warehouse at ¢25,000 
												per year. The main issue between 
												the parties was, therefore, 
												whether the first consignment of 
												goods was sold to the defendants 
												or not; that is whether or not 
												the goods, the subject-matter of 
												the claim were sold to the 
												defendants outright or sold to 
												them on sell-or-return basis.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In their first ground of appeal 
												the defendants contend that the 
												court of Appeal erred in holding 
												that the provisions of Order 63 
												Rule 2A of the High Court (Civil 
												Procedure) Rules 1954 (L.N. 
												140A) as amended by L.I 1107 are 
												purely administrative (or 
												directory) and its infringement 
												by a Court will not render a 
												judgment null and void. They 
												also contend, that the judgment 
												of the Court of Appeal is null 
												and void, having been given on 
												15th April, 1999 a few days 
												after eight weeks after close of 
												case contrary to Rule 33 
												sub-rules 1 and 2 of the Court 
												of Appeal Rules, 1997, C.I. 19.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The two grounds of appeal are 
												considered together because they 
												raise the same issues.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Order 63 r. 2A of L.N. 140A 
												provides:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;2A (1) At the close of a case 
												before it the Court shall fix a 
												date, which shall be not later 
												than six weeks after the close 
												of that case, for the delivery 
												of judgment therein. </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(2) It shall be the duty of the 
												Court to deliver judgment as 
												soon as possible after the close 
												of each case before it, and in 
												any event not later than six 
												weeks after the close of any 
												such case.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(3) For the purposes of this 
												rule a case shall be deemed to 
												be closed when the evidence has 
												been given to the Court and the 
												speeches subsequent thereto have 
												been concluded.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(4) The times of the vacations 
												in any year shall not be 
												reckoned in the computation of 
												the period of six weeks referred 
												to in this rule.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(5) Where for any reason 
												judgment has not been delivered 
												within the period of six weeks 
												referred to in this rule, the 
												Court shall forthwith inform the 
												Chief Justice in writing of that 
												fact and shall state the reasons 
												for the delay in so delivering 
												judgment and the date upon which 
												it is proposed to deliver 
												judgment.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(6) Where judgment has not been 
												delivered within the period of 
												six weeks referred to in this 
												rule, any party to the 
												proceedings may in writing 
												notify the Chief Justice of that 
												fact and request that a date be 
												fixed for the delivery of 
												judgment.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												(7) Upon receiving a 
												notification from the Court or a 
												party under paragraph (5) or (6) 
												the Chief Justice may fix a date 
												for the delivery of judgment by 
												the Court and notify the Court 
												accordingly, and it shall be the 
												duty of such Court to ensure 
												that judgment is delivered upon 
												the date so fixed by the Chief 
												Justice&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the recent case of THE 
												REPUBLIC Versus JUDICIAL 
												COMMITTEE OF THE CENTRAL REGION 
												HOUSE OF CHIEFS:&nbsp; EX-PARTE SUPI 
												MARK AABA and ORS, S.C., CIVIL 
												APPEAL NO. 1/99 dated 25TH JULY, 
												2000, unreported, this Court 
												unanimously held that the 
												provisions of Order 63 Rule 2A 
												are mandatory, not 
												administrative or directory and 
												any judgment given on 
												contravention of it is null and 
												void.&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												However, in the Republic vrs. 
												The High Court, Accra, Ex Parte 
												Expandable Polysterene Products 
												Limited decided this morning the 
												Court held that in view of 
												Article 157(3) of the 
												constitution, 1992 to which the 
												Court&#8217;s attention was not drawn 
												in Ex-Parte: Supi Mark Aaba, a 
												judge of a Superior Court who 
												has heard a case to its 
												conclusion cannot withdraw from 
												it or become functus functio 
												until he has delivered judgment; 
												and therefore a judgment 
												delivered by him more than six 
												weeks after close of the case is 
												not null and void.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Applying this decision to the 
												instance case this ground of 
												appeal must be dismissed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												However, we want to make a few 
												comments on the lengthy and 
												learned submissions of counsel 
												for defendants before us, we 
												must begin by deploring the 
												approach counsel adopted. He 
												quoted only two of the seven 
												sub-rules of Order 63 rule 2A 
												and, basing his arguments on 
												these two sub-rules alone, 
												proceeded to submit that the 
												rule prescribes mandatory 
												requirements which render any 
												judgment of the High Court 
												delivered more than six weeks 
												after the close of a case null 
												and void. We cannot fathom his 
												motives for this approach but 
												whatever they were such an 
												approach to statutory 
												interpretation is improper and 
												should be discouraged. The 
												proper thing is to consider the 
												whole of the provision to be 
												interpreted in its context.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The question whether a statutory 
												provision imposes mandatory or 
												directory requirements arises 
												where, because of deficient 
												drafting, the statute uses words 
												of command without saying what 
												should happen in case of 
												non-compliance. In spite of the 
												deficiency or hiatus the Court, 
												charged with the responsibility 
												of enforcing the provision, must 
												ascertain what consequence the 
												legislature intended should 
												follow from a failure to comply 
												with the requirement. It seems 
												there is no universal rule for 
												determining whether a provision 
												is mandatory or directory. See 
												Lord Campbell L.C. in Liverpool 
												Borough Bank v. Turner (1860) 
												2GeG.F. and J502 at pp 507, 508 
												and Lord Penzance in Howard v. 
												Bodington (1877) 2 P.D. 203, at 
												p.211.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												However, there are some 
												opinions, which seem to indicate 
												a broad approach the Court may 
												apply in dealing with such 
												statutory provisions.&nbsp; Maxwell 
												on The Interpretation of 
												Statutes, 12th Edition states at 
												page 314:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;In some cases, the conditions 
												or forms prescribed by the 
												statute have been regarded as 
												essential to the act or thing 
												regulated by it, and their 
												omission has been held fatal to 
												its validity. In others, such 
												prescriptions have been 
												considered as merely directory, 
												the neglect of them involving 
												nothing more than liability to a 
												penalty, if any were imposed, 
												for breach of the enactment&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In the case of Montreal Street 
												Rly Co. vrs. Normandin [1917] 
												A.C. 170 at 174 (P.C.) Sir 
												Arthur Channell said:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;When the provisions of a 
												statute relate to the 
												performance of a public duty and 
												the case is such that to hold 
												null and void acts done in 
												respect of this duty would work 
												serious inconvenience or 
												injustice to persons who have no 
												control over those entrusted 
												with the duty, and at the same 
												time would not promote the main 
												objective of the legislature, it 
												has been the practice to hold 
												such provisos to be directory 
												only, the neglect of them though 
												punishable, not affecting the 
												validity of the acts done&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												These words are very apt.&nbsp;
												</span></p>

												We agree with the view of 
												Foster, J.A. in the court below 
												that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;(L)itigation as it was at the 
												present is already expensive 
												enough. To construe the local 
												rules (Ord. 63 r.2A) in 
												conformity with counsel&#8217;s 
												submission and declare null and 
												void a whole judgment obtained 
												after years of litigation would 
												be most unjust and unfair to the 
												parties, who have no control 
												over the delivery of judgments 
												by the Courts.&nbsp; The parties 
												would thereby be punished for 
												the indolence and neglect of 
												judicial officers but the real 
												culprits pay no price.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												We also agree with the Court of 
												Appeal, per the late Foster, 
												J.A., that the disciplinary 
												power of the Chief Justice over 
												offending judges is deterring 
												enough to keep the judges on 
												their toes.&nbsp; Ordinarily the 
												Chief Justice has no power to 
												interfere with the exercise by a 
												judge of his judicial powers 
												during a trial, including when 
												to deliver judgment. Thus in 
												Mahama v. Soli [1976] 1GLR 96, 
												Edward Wiredu, J, (as he then 
												was) refused an order of the 
												Chief Justice not to read a 
												judgment he was about to 
												deliver. But a judge who fails 
												to deliver judgment within six 
												weeks after the close of a case 
												may suffer the humiliation of 
												being ordered to deliver 
												judgment on or by a date fixed 
												by the Chief Justice. </span>

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Indeed the construction urged 
												upon us by counsel for the 
												appellants offends against a 
												rule of interpretation that 
												&#8220;when there is a choice of 
												meanings there is a presumption 
												that one which produces an 
												absurd, unjust or inconvenient 
												result was not intended&#8230;..&#8221; &#8212; 
												Cross: Statutory Interpretation, 
												2nd Ed. Pp 16-17.&nbsp; In s.314 of 
												his code, Benion in his 
												Statutory Interpretation 2nd 
												Edition at page 686 states that:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The court seeks to avoid a 
												construction that causes 
												unjustifiable inconvenience to 
												persons who are subject to the 
												enactment, since this is 
												unlikely to have been intended 
												by Parliament.&nbsp; Sometimes 
												however there are overriding 
												reasons for applying such a 
												construction, for example where 
												it appears that Parliament 
												intended it or the literal 
												meaning is too strong&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												We do not think there is any 
												overriding reason for applying 
												such a construction to Order 63 
												rule 2A.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												As the learned author also says 
												this is an area where 
												consequential construction is 
												applied.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;If the Court were to hold the 
												most trivial breach of an 
												apparently absolute requirement 
												as vitiating the relevant 
												transaction, the consequences 
												would after be out of all 
												proportion to the lapse&#8221;. </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In all the arguments on Order 63 
												rule 2A one rule or provision 
												seems to have been ignored and 
												that is that under Order 70 of 
												L.N. 140A failure to comply with 
												the Civil Procedure rules (L.N. 
												140A) does not nullity 
												proceedings, but should be 
												treated as an irregularity. 
												While such irregular proceedings 
												may be set aside they are not 
												vitiated ab initio. Since Order 
												63 Rule 2A is only&nbsp; a rule of 
												procedure non-compliance with it 
												should not necessarily vitiate 
												proceedings.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												For all these reasons the first 
												main ground must be dismissed.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Another ground of appeal is that 
												the Court of Appeal erred in 
												treating Invoice No. 7169 of 2nd 
												September, 1987 and Invoice No. 
												739 of 15th October, 1987 
												respectively as evidence when 
												(a) they were attached to the 
												Statement of Claim and equally 
												wrongfully marked as &#8220;exhibits&#8221; 
												PSIL (a) and (b) respectively, 
												contrary to the rules on 
												pleading; (b) they were never 
												formally tendered in evidence as 
												required by the Evidence Decree 
												and Civil Procedure Rules; and 
												(c) the Court of Appeal ignored 
												the substantial legal arguments 
												against this type of procedure 
												without giving any reasons but 
												accepted the documents as 
												evidence.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												There is much merit in this 
												ground. It has become a practice 
												among some lawyers in this 
												country to attach documents to 
												pleadings and mark them as 
												exhibits, as was done in this 
												case. This is wrong. It is an 
												attempt to adduce evidence 
												through the pleadings but this 
												is not allowed by Ord.19 r. 4 of 
												L.N. 140A.&nbsp; Judicial evidence 
												must be given by witnesses who 
												before they testify must take an 
												oath or affirmation that they 
												will speak the truth.&nbsp; 
												Statements made without such 
												oath or affirmation are not to 
												be considered evidence:&nbsp; See 
												s.61 of the Evidence Decree 
												(NRCD 323). An exception to this 
												rule is to be found in s.62 (2) 
												of the Courts Act, 1993, (Act 
												459) which allows unsworn 
												evidence to be given by a person 
												whose religious belief does not 
												permit him to take any oath 
												whatsoever or who is of immature 
												age. Another exception is s.63 
												of NRCD 323, which allows the 
												accused in a criminal trial to 
												make an unsworn statement.&nbsp; 
												Evidence may also be given by 
												affidavit if the rules permit, 
												such as in an action commenced 
												by originating summons or 
												evidence contained in an 
												affidavit in support of or in 
												opposition to a motion or 
												summons. The attachment of a 
												document to a pleading and 
												marked &#8220;exhibit&#8221; does not fall 
												into any of these exceptions to 
												the general rule in s.61 of NRCD 
												323.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Court of Appeal therefore 
												erred when it referred to the 
												two documents attached to the 
												statement of claim as evidence. 
												They should have been excluded 
												from the evidence by the Court 
												of Appeal and should be excluded 
												from evidence before this Court.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												But even without these two 
												documents marked Exhibits PSIL 
												(a) and PSIL (b) there is ample 
												evidence on which the Court of 
												Appeal could and did rely, and 
												on which this Court can rely, to 
												come to the determination that 
												there was a sale of the goods 
												the subject-matter of the appeal 
												before us.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The document wrongly marked as 
												Exhibit PSIL (a) is the same as 
												Exhibit 2, which was tendered in 
												evidence by the defendant.&nbsp; It 
												is an invoice showing that the 
												Plaintiffs shipped the goods to 
												the Defendants whose Managing 
												Director was one Godwin K. 
												Anagbo and who gave evidence as 
												the Defendants representative, 
												as per Invoice No. 7169 dated 
												September 2, 1987.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												According to this document the 
												consignment consisted of (a) 
												38,491 pairs of used Green Olive 
												Green Ladies Shorts at S1.20 per 
												unit for a total sum of 
												US$46,189; and 25 pairs of used 
												soccer boots at $1.00 a unit for 
												a total sum of $25.00.&nbsp; The 
												Grand Total of the price of the 
												consignment came to US$46,214.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Bill of Lading shows Godwin 
												Anagbo, Godka Group of 
												Companies, as Consignee and Paul 
												Penu as the notifying party. It 
												also shows that the goods were 
												shipped in a 20 feet container 
												No. CTIU 321373-5 Seal No. 
												0002008 and contained 141 Bales 
												and 1 Box of Used Wearing 
												Apparel (Ladies Shorts) </span>
												</p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Exhibit 2 is clear evidence of 
												the sale of used olive green 
												ladies shorts by the Plaintiffs 
												to the defendants. Apart from 
												this, the defendants 
												representative and its Managing 
												Director himself, in his 
												evidence testified that he 
												received a consignment of used 
												clothing, biscuits and some 
												green &#8220;shorts&#8221; from the 
												plaintiffs. He said the 
												defendants bought the used 
												clothing and biscuits but as 
												regards the green shorts his 
												duty was to clear the goods and 
												keep them in the warehouse for 
												Penu.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In their statement of defence 
												the defendants also denied that 
												the olive green ladies shorts 
												were sold to them. According to 
												them it was agreed that the 
												ladies shorts be shipped to 
												their address for details of 
												distribution; when the shorts 
												arrived in Ghana the European 
												manager of the Plaintiffs to 
												Ghana and it was agreed the 
												Defendants should try to sell or 
												return the goods.&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												From all these pieces of 
												evidence one thing is clear:&nbsp; 
												the Defendants received from the 
												plaintiffs a consignment of used 
												clothing, biscuits and used 
												olive green ladies shorts. It is 
												also not in dispute that the 
												used clothing and biscuits were 
												sold to the Defendants. The only 
												real issue between the parties 
												is whether the used olive green 
												ladies shorts were sent to the 
												Defendants on a sale &#8211; or return 
												basis.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Both the trial High Court Judge 
												and the Court of Appeal had no 
												difficulty in concluding that 
												the shorts were sold to the 
												Defendants and not sent to them 
												on a sale-or-return basis. We 
												agree with them.&nbsp; As the trial 
												judge said, if the goods were 
												not sold to the Defendants or if 
												they were rejected how did it 
												come about that they made part 
												payment for their value?&nbsp; For 
												payment for the goods is 
												inconsistent with the 
												Defendants&#8217; assertion that the 
												goods were rejected by them. 
												Also the Defendant&#8217;s failed to 
												demonstrate by way of adduced 
												evidence that they rejected the 
												goods upon delivery to them.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Court of Appeal on its part, 
												also considered&nbsp; two messages 
												from Defendants to the 
												Plaintiffs and came to the 
												conclusion that &#8220;there is no 
												indication in these messages 
												that the appellants (Defendants) 
												were mere warehousemen and that 
												the goods were meant to be 
												stocked and be sold by Mr. Penu 
												the agent of the respondents 
												(plaintiffs).&#8221; The court 
												concluded the appellants 
												imported and took delivery of 
												the goods as purchasers and not 
												as warehousemen.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												We think there was ample 
												evidence to support and justify 
												the conclusions the courts below 
												came to. There is nothing in the 
												lengthy arguments of counsel for 
												the appellants which will 
												justify our interfering in any 
												way with those conclusions. This 
												ground too should also be 
												dismissed.&nbsp; </span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The Defendants have vigorously 
												challenged the validity of the 
												appointment of Dr. A.Q.A. 
												Archampong as the attorney for 
												the plaintiffs. They contend 
												that the Court of Appeal erred 
												in its view that Brower (Vice 
												President, Finance) of P.S. 
												International Limited acting 
												alone could under the Companies 
												Code, 1963 (Act 179) grant a 
												power of attorney to anybody in 
												Ghana to sue on behalf of P.S. 
												International Limited thereby 
												misinterpreting section 137(1) 
												of the Companies Code, 1963 
												which it held was the applicable 
												law.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Basing his arguments on Sections 
												137(1) of the Companies Code 
												(Act 179) and Regulation 77(1) 
												of the Second Schedule to Act 
												179 Part I Table A &#8211; Regulations 
												for a Private Company Limited by 
												Shares, counsel for the 
												Defendants has submitted that in 
												Ghana for a company to grant a 
												power of attorney to somebody to 
												act on its behalf, it must be 
												either through a resolution of 
												the board of directors, or 
												members at a general meeting.&nbsp; A 
												fortiori before a person can 
												initiate legal proceedings as 
												the lawful attorney of a company 
												in Ghana he must have been so 
												appointed either at a general 
												meeting, or by the company 
												acting through its board of 
												directors.&nbsp; In both situations a 
												resolution is required.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												With respect, the statement that 
												in both situations a resolution 
												is required is not correct. It 
												is not supported by the texts of 
												section 137(1) of Act 179 and 
												Regulation 77(1) of Table A part 
												I of the Second Schedule to Act 
												179 or any reasonable 
												interpretation of them or the 
												general principles of Ghana 
												Company law.&nbsp; Section 137 of Act 
												179 provides:&#8212;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;A company shall act through its 
												members in general meeting or 
												its board of directors or 
												through officers or agents 
												appointed by, or under authority 
												derived from the members in 
												general meeting or the board of 
												directors.&#8221;</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												This provision codifies an 
												established rule that a company, 
												being an artificial person, must 
												act through human agents. S. 137 
												of Act 179 is mainly concerned 
												with the division of powers 
												between the general meeting and 
												the board of directors. It says 
												nothing about the mode of 
												appointment of the organs of the 
												company and its officers and 
												agents.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Regulation 77(1) of Table A Part 
												I also provides:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;The board of directors may from 
												time to time appoint officers 
												and agents of the company and 
												may appoint any body corporate, 
												firm, or body of persons, 
												whether nominated directly or 
												indirectly, by the board of 
												directors, to be the attorney or 
												attorneys of the company for 
												such purposes and with such 
												powers, authorities and 
												discretions, not exceeding those 
												vested in or exercisable by the 
												directors under these 
												regulations, and for such period 
												and subject to such conditions 
												as they may think fit&#8221;.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												The clear intendment of this 
												provision is to vest the power 
												to appoint officers and agents 
												of the company in the board of 
												directors (rather than the 
												general meeting). It does not 
												specify the mode of appointment. 
												It does not say, and there is 
												nothing in it which will justify 
												the interpretation, that for any 
												such appointment to be valid a 
												resolution of the board must be 
												produced or it must be proved 
												that the board passed a 
												resolution to appoint the agent.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Under s.144 of Act 179 a company 
												may make a contract in the same 
												way as an individual may.&nbsp; If 
												the law requires that a contract 
												made between individuals ought 
												to be in writing under seal or 
												should be in writing or 
												evidenced in writing signed by 
												the parties, a company will be 
												bound to contract in the same 
												way. If a contract between 
												individuals can be made by 
												parole only so can a contract by 
												a company. In other words a 
												company may make a contract with 
												no more formality than is 
												required in the case of an 
												individual.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In any case a person contracting 
												with a company is not required 
												to demand the production of a 
												resolution authorizing the 
												board, the general meeting, an 
												officer or agent of the company, 
												as the case may be, to enter 
												into the contract.&nbsp; It has been 
												established since the case of 
												the Royal British Bank v. 
												Turquand (1856) 6 E and B 327; 
												[1843-60] All E.R. Rep. 435 
												[Exchequer Chamber] that a 
												person dealing with a company is 
												entitled to assume, in the 
												absence of facts putting him on 
												notice or inquiry, that there 
												has been due compliance with all 
												matters of internal management 
												and procedure required by the 
												Regulations of the company.&nbsp; 
												This is the Rule in Turquand&#8217;s 
												case or the &#8220;Indoor Management&#8221; 
												Rule. This rule is codified by 
												our Companies Code, Act 179, in 
												sections 139 to 143. Under s.142 
												(2), if the company has held out 
												some one as its agent it is 
												estopped from denying the 
												appointment; and a de jure or de 
												facto officer of the company can 
												be assumed to have the usual 
												powers and duties of that sort 
												of officer.</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												Section 142(2) is also in 
												accordance with normal agency 
												principles. Where a person 
												enters into a contract with an 
												officer or agent of a company 
												who has apparent or ostensible 
												authority of the company to 
												enter into the contract on its 
												behalf it will be estopped from 
												denying the authority of the 
												officer or agent. Since the case 
												of Freeman and Lockeyer v 
												Buckhust Part Properties 
												(Mangal) Ltd [1964] 2 Q.B. 480]&nbsp; 
												[1964] 1 All E.R. 630 (C.A.)&nbsp; 
												The courts have preferred to 
												deal with such cases according 
												to agency principles rather than 
												in accordance with the Rule in 
												Turquand&#8217;s Case. In the Freeman 
												and Lockeyer Case (supra) 
												Diplock, L.J. (as he then was) 
												defined apparent or ostensible 
												authority as follows:</span></p>
												<p class="MsoNormal">
												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												&#8220;An &#8220;apparent&#8221; or &#8220;ostensible&#8221;

												relationship between the 
												principal and the contractor 
												created by a representation made 
												by the principal to the 
												contractor, intended to be and 
												in fact acted upon by the 
												contractor that the agent has 
												authority to enter on behalf of 
												the principal into a contract of 
												a kind within the scope of the 
												&#8220;apparent&#8221; authority, so as to 
												render the principal liable to 
												perform any obligations imposed 
												upon him by such contract.&#8221;&nbsp;

												Ltd [1968] 1 Q.B. 549; [1967] 3

												Applying all these principles to

												and delivered the document for 
												and on behalf of the plaintiff 
												company &#8211; and not in his 
												personal capacity. (3) From the 
												evidence on record he had been 
												sent to Ghana by the plaintiff 
												company to pursue the debts. 
												While here he held discussions 
												with the defendants who 
												unsuccessfully tried to persuade 
												him to do something about the 
												price. It was while he was in 
												Ghana that the power of attorney 
												was given to Dr. Archampong.</span></p>

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In our opinion Brower had 
												apparent or ostensible authority 
												on behalf of the plaintiff's 
												company to appoint Dr. 
												Archampong as the plaintiff&#8217;s 
												attorney. Even if he had no 
												actual authority to do so there 
												was nothing to put Dr. 
												Archampong on inquiry about his 
												lack of authority. Dr. 
												Archampong was viz-a-viz P.S. 
												International Limited an 
												outsider, in the sense that he 
												had no actual knowledge of 
												Brower&#8217;s lack of authority; nor 
												in a position or relationship to 
												the company from which he ought 
												to have known that he had no 
												authority to give the power of 
												attorney &#8211; See proviso (a) to 
												Section 142 (d) of Act 179.</span></p>

												<span style="font-family: Arial">
												In terms of the Power of 
												Attorney granted to him by the 
												Plaintiff he had authority to 
												institute the proceeding against

												the proceedings.</span></p>
