                                              We are assembled here this morning 
                                              to mourn the passing away of Mrs 
                                              Janet Daniels, a distinguished 
                                              member of the Ghana Bar. I have to 
                                              say that I have not had the 
                                              privilege of seeing and meeting 
                                              with her since the past two years 
                                              for reasons beyond my control. And 
                                              only last week, I said to myself: 
                                              the first thing I would do is to 
                                              call on Janet at her residence 
                                              with a view to paying my respects 
                                              and to continue to tap from her 
                                              rich experience as an expert in 
                                              legal publications. Little did I 
                                              know that the last thing I would 
                                              be called upon to do for her is to 
                                              appear at her funeral service and 
                                              deliver a tribute to her honour 
                                              and memory.</span></p>

                                              Law Reporting in 1972. She had in 
                                              1965 been appointed by the General

                                              development of Ghanaian law

                                              during the first decade of its 
                                              life, willingly gave up the

                                              record with admiration and a deep 
                                              sense of gratefulness, the immense 
                                              and invaluable contribution made 
                                              by Mrs Janet Daniels to the 
                                              preparation and publication of the

                                              of Ghana Law. Perhaps, her greater 
                                              contribution is to be found in her 
                                              work as the Editor of the Review. 
                                              She nurtured the Review from its 
                                              birth to its present position. She 
                                              always insisted that articles and 
                                              Notes and Comments submitted for 
                                              publication in the Review should 
                                              be sharp, crisp and as far as 
                                              possible accurate. She not only 
                                              edited (with a heavy hand) 
                                              articles received for publication 
                                              but she herself found time to 
                                              write invaluable articles for 
                                              publication in the Review, ie 
                                              articles such as Statute Law in 
                                              Ghana, Trial by Jury, Patterns and 
                                              Fashions in Reported Judgments and 
                                              her contribution to an interesting 
                                              article: Symposium on Defamation 
                                              of Women. With such a contribution 
                                              lasting over a period of sixteen 
                                              years, we all must share the sad 
                                              regret that the Council for Law 
                                              Reporting would be the poorer with

                                              Daniels. The Review and its 
                                              readers would like to wish Mrs 
                                              Janet Daniels a very happy
