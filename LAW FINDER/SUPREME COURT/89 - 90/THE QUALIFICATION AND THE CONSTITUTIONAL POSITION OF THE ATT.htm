                                              The National Commission for 
                                              Democracy and the Ministry of 
                                              Local Government ran a series of 
                                              regional seminars on &quot;District 
                                              Assemblies and the Evolving 
                                              Democratic Process&quot; from 5 July to 
                                              9 November 1990. As the seminars 
                                              progressed, it became clear that 
                                              issues of constitution making were 
                                              the focus of the debate. The 
                                              consensus would appear to be for a 
                                              constitutional democratic 
                                              government even though the 
                                              modalities for such an arrangement 
                                              do not appear to be agreed upon. 
                                              One of the important institutions 
                                              for the achievement of any concept 
                                              of the rule of law and democracy 
                                              is the office of the 
                                              Attorney-General and/or Minister 
                                              for Justice. It has had a 
                                              chequered history both in the past 
                                              and in the post independence era 
                                              and yet does not appear to have 
                                              been touched upon during those 
                                              seminars. Admittedly, time could 
                                              not allow for a discussion of all 
                                              institutions. Since the debate is 
                                              an on-going one we have thought it 
                                              necessary to discuss the 
                                              qualification and the 
                                              constitutional position of the 
                                              Attorney-General and/or Minister 
                                              of Justice. Before then we think 
                                              it essential to set out a resume 
                                              of the subject and set ourselves 
                                              the scope of the burden we intend 
                                              to address.</span></p>

                                              Before Ghana became a republic the 
                                              Attorney-General was a public 
                                              servant and his conditions of 
                                              service were determined by 
                                              Constitutional Orders in Council, 
                                              rules and regulations governing 
                                              the Gold Coast public service. No 
                                              specific qualification in terms of 
                                              years standing at the Bar appears 
                                              to have been required.1 This 
                                              public service status of an 
                                              Attorney-General and/or Minister 
                                              for Justice was abolished by the 
                                              Republican Constitution, 1960,2 
                                              and all subsequent constitutions 
                                              have maintained the non-public 
                                              service status of that office.3 
                                              The governments of the National 
                                              Liberation Council and the 
                                              National Redemption Council, would 
                                              appear to have made the 
                                              Attorney-General a civil or public 
                                              servant even though that office 
                                              was also conjunctive with that of 
                                              the Commissioner for Justice which 
                                              was admittedly political in 
                                              character.4 While enacting that 
                                              the Attorney-general was a member 
                                              of the legal service class of the 
                                              civil service, the NLC appears to 
                                              have negated that status in 
                                              reality by a subsequent 
                                              legislation making the provisions 
                                              of the Civil Service Act, as 
                                              amended to be subject to paragraph 
                                              6 of the Proclamation which 
                                              conferred on the NLC the power to 
                                              appoint a person to the office of 
                                              the Attorney-General.5 Similarly 
                                              the NRC conferred on the 
                                              Attorney-General a civil service 
                                              status. However, his appointment 
                                              was to be done directly by the 
                                              NRC.6 Both the NLC and the NRC 
                                              introduced qualification in terms 
                                              of years' standing at the Bar for 
                                              appointment as an 
                                              Attorney-General. The 
                                              Attorney-General was to be of at 
                                              least twelve years' standing as a 
                                              lawyer or in exceptional 
                                              circumstances, ten years.7 The NRC 
                                              for the first time impliedly 
                                              established the post of Deputy 
                                              Attorney-General who was the 
                                              official administrative head of 
                                              the legal class. His standing as a 
                                              lawyer was to be the same as that 
                                              of the Attorney-General. But he 
                                              was a category A officer under the 
                                              Civil Service Act, appointed upon 
                                              the recommendation of the Legal 
                                              Class Board and therefore 
                                              removable only under the Act.8</span></p>

                                              paragraphs 1 and 3 of LI 1288 the 
                                              board purported not only to

                                              public servants and impose a 
                                              requirement of fifteen years' 
                                              standing at the Bar as the minimum 
                                              qualification for appointment.12 
                                              By this device the status and 
                                              qualification of an 
                                              Attorney-General and Deputy 
                                              Attorney-General would appear to 
                                              have been changed, not on the 
                                              advise of the board but by its 
                                              legislative instrument. This state 
                                              of affairs has given rise to some 
                                              questions as to the limits of the 
                                              powers of the government in the 
                                              appointment of not only the 
                                              Attorney-General and his deputy 
                                              but also that of the Secretary for 
                                              Justice and his deputy. An 
                                              argument would thus be raised 
                                              whether the appointment of a 
                                              person as an Attorney-General 
                                              necessarily confers on him the 
                                              status of Secretary for Justice 
                                              and vice versa. Two ideas about 
                                              the office would arise from this 
                                              argument - the separate office 
                                              notion and the combined office 
                                              concept. A casual consideration of 
                                              these issues would indicate the 
                                              confusion which the present state 
                                              of the law on the qualification 
                                              and constitutional position of an 
                                              Attorney-General could create.</span></p>

                                              the material and human resources 
                                              of the colonies for consolidating 
                                              its own economic and political 
                                              power.&nbsp; The colonial legal system 
                                              was accordingly fashioned to 
                                              achieve control and dominion over 
                                              the colonies and their resources. 
                                              During the period of 
                                              decolonisation, efforts were made 
                                              to stem the tide and tempo of the 
                                              pressure for independence by 
                                              allowing participation of the 
                                              colonial people in the affairs of 
                                              the colony. But it reserved for 
                                              itself control over sensitive 
                                              political and socio-economic 
                                              departments in the political 
                                              structure.&nbsp; The control over the 
                                              legal system and its apparatus 
                                              thus reflected its exploitative 
                                              economic norms. Elected 
                                              representatives of the colonised 
                                              people could not be trusted to 
                                              administer those institutions of 
                                              government that made it possible 
                                              for the exercise of effective 
                                              control.</span></p>

                                              In July 1960, Ghana formally broke 
                                              off the last vestiges of 
                                              colonialism by adopting a 
                                              Republican Constitution. This 
                                              Constitution provided for &quot;an

                                              public servant who was unaffected 
                                              by changes in government.22</span></p>

                                              This falls in line with the

                                              forming the government.23 They are 
                                              both appointed by the Queen on the 
                                              recommendation of the Prime 
                                              Minister and no qualification as a

                                              The Republican Constitution, 1960, 
                                              in the absence of a bi-cameral 
                                              parliamentary system followed the 
                                              British tradition by conferring 
                                              wide discretionary powers on the 
                                              President to appoint a Minister of

                                              Attorney-General. It made it

                                              In fact the Constitution provided 
                                              explicitly in article 71(1)(i) 
                                              that a member of the civil service 
                                              could not be a member of the 
                                              National Assembly. Therefore a 
                                              minister of state or a ministerial 
                                              secretary could not be a civil 
                                              servant. The discretion to appoint 
                                              and remove the Minister of Justice 
                                              and the Attorney-General under the 
                                              Constitution was thus absolutely 
                                              unaffected by qualification as to 
                                              standing as a lawyer or status as 
                                              a civil servant.27 The Third 
                                              Republican Constitution, 1979, 
                                              simply re-enacted the 1969 
                                              provisions with necessary 
                                              amendments to reflect the 
                                              presidential character of the 
                                              Constitution.28 Both Constitutions 
                                              apart from the requisite 
                                              qualification for membership of 
                                              parliament, did not restrict the 
                                              power of government in the 
                                              appointment, removal or dismissal 
                                              of the Minister of Justice and the 
                                              Attorney-General.</span></p>

                                              Attorney-General was to exercise

                                              however appear that the effect of

                                              the Director of Public

                                              therefore LI 1288 has the force of 
                                              substantive PNDC law. But if that 
                                              is accepted as the case then it 
                                              would produce contradictory and 
                                              absurd results. It would, for 
                                              example, mean that the substantive 
                                              Attorney-General at the time was 
                                              being reduced in status to a 
                                              Deputy Attorney-General who was 
                                              then being promoted from the post 
                                              of Director of Public Prosecutions 
                                              to that post.&nbsp; The mere approval 
                                              of LI 1288 cannot in law give the 
                                              legislative instrument the force 
                                              of a substantive enactment. This 
                                              is why the substantive Secretary 
                                              for Justice and Attorney-General 
                                              duly appointed in accordance with 
                                              sections 1(4) and 12 of the 
                                              Proclamation deemed it necessary 
                                              to hold on to the post of Director 
                                              of Public Prosecutions in order to 
                                              continue to be subject to the 
                                              public service conditions of 
                                              service. This shows that the then 
                                              Secretary for Justice and 
                                              Attorney-General himself 
                                              appreciated the fact that the post 
                                              of Attorney-General is not a 
                                              public service office under the 
                                              Proclamation. If the post of 
                                              Attorney-General were a public 
                                              service one then the appointment 
                                              of the Director of Public 
                                              Prosecutions as PNDC Secretary for 
                                              Justice and Attorney-General in 
                                              1982 should have been considered 
                                              as a promotion out of turn. Even 
                                              after LI 1288 was passed in 1983 
                                              the appointment of the 
                                              Attorney-General was not 
                                              considered a promotion out of 
                                              turn. By some contrivance, under 
                                              LI 1288 the unfortunate impression 
                                              was created of the existence of a 
                                              public service office of Deputy 
                                              Attorney-General to which the 
                                              Director of Public Prosecutions 
                                              (who was also the 
                                              Attorney-General) had to be 
                                              promoted to enable the latter post 
                                              to be filled.&nbsp; The fallacy of this 
                                              arrangement which we shall 
                                              presently show is misconceived, is 
                                              that Ghana has not, since 31 
                                              December 1981 had a substantive 
                                              Attorney-General.</span></p>

                                              Be that as it may, it is our view 
                                              that the abrogation of the 
                                              Constitution, 1979, does not have 
                                              the effect of reviving NRCD 277 in 
                                              so far as the post of Deputy 
                                              Attorney-General is concerned. The 
                                              public service continued in force 
                                              by the Proclamation, 1981 excluded 
                                              that office. The amendments 
                                              purported to have been effected by 
                                              the Civil Service (Amendment) Law, 
                                              1982 (PNDCL 20) by inserting the 
                                              post of Attorney-General and 
                                              Deputy Attorney-General in the 
                                              Schedules of the Civil Service Act 
                                              (CA 5) which were deemed to have 
                                              been repealed by the Constitution, 
                                              1979, did not restore the 
                                              provision of the Act dealing with 
                                              the office, functions and duties 
                                              of an Attorney-General and his 
                                              deputy. Consequently, the office 
                                              which is mentioned in PNDCL 42 
                                              cannot be said to be a civil 
                                              service post. At the time of 
                                              promulgating the Proclamation, 
                                              1981, there was no such office 
                                              under NRCD 277. The office now 
                                              exists as an office under the 
                                              Proclamation. This fact appears to 
                                              have been recognised by the 
                                              supposed Legal Service Board in 
                                              its definition of lawyers in the 
                                              office of the Attorney-General. It 
                                              is therefore our submission that 
                                              the purported promotion of the 
                                              substantive Attorney-General from

                                              of Director of Public Prosecutions 
                                              from which he was on secondment to 
                                              the post of Deputy 
                                              Attorney-General does not make 
                                              either the Attorney-General qua 
                                              Attorney-General, or in his second

                                              attention to the composition of 
                                              the Legal Service Board and the 
                                              signatories to LI 1288. The 
                                              legislative instrument is 
                                              purported to have been signed by 
                                              the Chairman and three other 
                                              members of the Board. An 
                                              examination of section 40 of PNDCL 
                                              42 shows that two persons who were 
                                              to have been appointed by the 
                                              government as Board members were 
                                              never appointed and were therefore 
                                              not signatories to the legislative 
                                              instrument. Neither was there a 
                                              Deputy Attorney-General to 
                                              complete the statutory mandatory 
                                              requirements for the composition 
                                              of the Board. From our researches 
                                              we found that the Legal Service 
                                              Board has never been legally in 
                                              place as the government has never 
                                              appointed its nominees to the

                                              amendments been made to the 
                                              composition of the Board. This in 
                                              our view raises a further issue as 
                                              to the legality of LI 1288. It is 
                                              our view that the law sets out 
                                              mandatory requirements for the 
                                              composition of the Legal Service 
                                              Board by stating that &quot;there shall

                                              absence therefore of the 
                                              appointment of such members of the 
                                              Board there cannot be a functional 
                                              Legal Service Board, for the 
                                              statutory language is not 
                                              permissive. It is imperative. It 
                                              stands to reason that in the 
                                              absence of a properly constituted 
                                              Board the power to make 
                                              legislative instruments cannot 
                                              exist. Any purported exercise of 
                                              such a power is a nullity and the 
                                              issue of a quorum does not even 
                                              arise.41 Further support for this 
                                              submission can be found in several 
                                              PNDC laws in which both the 
                                              mandatory requirements for the 
                                              composition of Boards are spelt 
                                              out together with the names of 
                                              Board members including the number 
                                              which may constitute a quorum for 
                                              the transaction of business. In 
                                              some of these laws it is even 
                                              provided that a defect in 
                                              composition or appointment of the 
                                              Board are not to effect the 
                                              validity of any proceedings of the 
                                              Board. Other PNDC laws are couched 
                                              in the same imperative language 
                                              such as section 40 of PNDCL 42 
                                              with a proviso for the Board to 
                                              make regulations for the conduct 
                                              of its business. It should be 
                                              pointed out also that even though 
                                              the government has not appointed 
                                              any lawyer in the office of the 
                                              Attorney-General to the Board, 
                                              some divisional heads of the legal 
                                              service have always attended 
                                              meetings of the Board as co-opted 
                                              members. Despite the fact that 
                                              section 40(7) does not give them a 
                                              vote, they were signatories to the 
                                              Legal Service (Amendment) 
                                              Regulations, 1987 (LI 1342) which 
                                              was also approved by the 
                                              government. That regulation deals 
                                              with the salaries and benefits, 
                                              etc and compulsory and voluntary 
                                              retirement of officers including 
                                              the Attorney-General and the 
                                              Deputy Attorney-General. The legal 
                                              validity of that regulation under 
                                              which attorneys including the 
                                              Attorney-General and his deputy 
                                              are supposed to receive their 
                                              emoluments is gravely in doubt.</span></p>

                                              Thirdly, it could be absurd if the 
                                              government, by PNDCL 42 intended 
                                              that the Legal Service Board which 
                                              when properly constituted, is 
                                              chaired by the Attorney-General 
                                              and of which the Deputy 
                                              Attorney-General is a member 
                                              should advise the government on 
                                              their own appointment and removal. 
                                              Does the government have to 
                                              consult the Board before it 
                                              removes the Attorney-General or 
                                              his deputy from office? Is the 
                                              Attorney-General to preside over 
                                              any deliberations of the Board to 
                                              discipline him for example? Or has 
                                              the Board powers to consider 
                                              disciplining the Attorney-General 
                                              and his deputy and also advise the 
                                              government on their dismissal? The 
                                              answers to these questions are 
                                              obvious and show the absurdity of 
                                              any contention that LI 1288 
                                              regulates the appointment, 
                                              remuneration, discipline and 
                                              removal of the Attorney-General or 
                                              his deputy. No government would 
                                              intend any such absurdity. That is 
                                              why even in the case of officers 
                                              of the legal service the law gives 
                                              the Board only advisory functions 
                                              in connection with the structure 
                                              and conduct of the affairs of the 
                                              legal service, and in particular 
                                              in relation to recruitment, 
                                              appointment, promotion, 
                                              remuneration, discipline, 
                                              dismissal and other conditions of 
                                              service. The proper body therefore 
                                              to determine the conditions of 
                                              service including the appointment, 
                                              etc. of members of the legal 
                                              service is the government itself 
                                              on the advice of the Board. The 
                                              power entrusted to the Board to 
                                              make regulations by legislative 
                                              instrument with the approval of 
                                              the government for the efficient 
                                              performance of the legal service 
                                              and the Board, in our view, did 
                                              not include the power to make 
                                              regulations in respect of matters 
                                              reserved by the law for 
                                              implementation by the government. 
                                              Even a properly constituted Board 
                                              would thus have been acting ultra 
                                              vires if it purported to legislate 
                                              on matters for which it is 
                                              imperatively enjoined to advise 
                                              the government for necessary 
                                              action.</span></p>

                                              From the foregoing analysis it is 
                                              our submission that the government 
                                              under PNDC (Establishment) 
                                              Proclamation, 1981 confers on 
                                              itself an unfettered discretion in

                                              and his deputy and any purported 
                                              limitation placed on that 
                                              unfettered discretion by an

                                              but this should be done by 
                                              substantive law as was the case

                                              void and of no effect whatsoever 
                                              and any act done under them is 
                                              void and of no effect whatsoever. 
                                              Their approval by the government 
                                              was done under a misapprehension 
                                              of the conditions precedent to the 
                                              exercise of the power of approval 
                                              and was therefore also a nullity.</span></p>

                                              In our examination of the various 
                                              Republican constitutional 
                                              provisions on the status of an 
                                              Attorney-General we demonstrated 
                                              that except for a period under the 
                                              First Republican Constitution, the 
                                              qualification, position and the 
                                              status of an Attorney-General was 
                                              inextricably interwoven with the 
                                              position of the Minister of 
                                              Justice. Since February 1966 the 
                                              same person has always exercised 
                                              ministerial responsibility for the 
                                              ministry of justice and the 
                                              Attorney-General's Office.42&nbsp; Even 
                                              under the Proclamations which have 
                                              intervened between the various 
                                              constitutions, the position and 
                                              status of the Attorney-General 
                                              has, in fact, always been 
                                              conjunctive with that of the 
                                              Commissioner for Justice. The 
                                              appointment or removal of a 
                                              minister or commissioner for 
                                              justice has always been at the 
                                              pleasure of the government. Thus 
                                              when the Commissioner for Justice 
                                              and the Attorney-General was 
                                              removed from office in 1975, he 
                                              could not plead the Civil Service 
                                              (Amendment) Decree, 1975 (NRCD 
                                              277) to maintain his supposed 
                                              unique civil service position of 
                                              an Attorney-General as distinct 
                                              from Commissioner for Justice. 
                                              Section 1(4) of PNDC 
                                              (Establishment) Proclamation, 1981 
                                              confers discretion on the 
                                              government to appoint such persons 
                                              as it may consider necessary to 
                                              take responsibility for any 
                                              ministry or department of state. 
                                              Paragraph 12(1) makes it 
                                              imperative for the Council to 
                                              appoint an Attorney-General. The 
                                              government could thus in the 
                                              exercise of its discretion appoint 
                                              a Secretary for Justice and 
                                              Attorney-General. Furthermore, the 
                                              discretion to appoint and assign 
                                              ministerial or departmental 
                                              responsibility is unfettered and 
                                              the government can in addition to 
                                              assigning ministerial or 
                                              departmental responsibility, 
                                              assign another person 
                                              responsibility as deputy to the 
                                              ministerial or departmental head. 
                                              This explains the appointment by 
                                              the government of deputy 
                                              secretaries for ministries or 
                                              departments. It is our view that 
                                              sections 1(4) and 12 of the 
                                              Proclamation puts the government 
                                              perfectly within its rights to 
                                              appoint and designate a person as 
                                              Secretary for Justice and the 
                                              Attorney-General as it did in 
                                              early 1982. This is because the 
                                              Proclamation, 1981, provides only 
                                              for an Attorney-General who was 
                                              appointed and designated as 
                                              Secretary for Justice and the 
                                              Attorney-General. Any reference to 
                                              the Deputy Attorney-General or 
                                              Deputy Secretary for Justice can 
                                              only be taken to mean any person 
                                              appointed as deputy to the holder 
                                              of the office created under 
                                              paragraphs 1(4) and 12.</span></p>

                                              The confusion in the content and

                                              result of an attempt to draw an 
                                              artificial distinction between the 
                                              Ministry of Justice and the 
                                              Attorney-General's Department. By 
                                              that distinction an 
                                              Attorney-General could have 
                                              ministerial responsibility, but 
                                              the Secretary for Justice need not 
                                              be the Attorney-General. To 
                                              stretch this argument further is 
                                              to say that the Secretary for 
                                              Justice or the ministerial head of 
                                              the Ministry of Justice need not 
                                              be a lawyer. In the absence of a 
                                              clear definition of the functions 
                                              of the Secretary for Justice and 
                                              Attorney-General this line of 
                                              reasoning can only lead to 
                                              confusion. One may ask whether in 
                                              such a case the Attorney-General 
                                              as principal legal adviser to the 
                                              government would be subordinate to 
                                              the Secretary for Justice. If the 
                                              Attorney-General is not a 
                                              secretary of state but a public 
                                              servant, subordinate to the 
                                              Secretary for Justice, then the 
                                              question would arise as to which 
                                              of them, the latter or the former 
                                              represents the ministry at cabinet 
                                              meetings as legal adviser to 
                                              government. It is submitted that 
                                              the only interpretation that will 
                                              achieve the object of the 
                                              legislature without introducing 
                                              inconsistencies, ambiguities and 
                                              absurdities is that the 
                                              legislature did not by the 
                                              Proclamation or PNDCL 42 intend a 
                                              division of the functions between 
                                              a Secretary for Justice on the one 
                                              hand and an Attorney-General on 
                                              the other.43 In fact such separate 
                                              offices were never intended. It is 
                                              our opinion that if it was the

                                              create two offices it would not 
                                              only have made separate budgets 
                                              for them but would have also

                                              It was not accidental that the 
                                              legislature in providing for the 
                                              composition of the Police Council 
                                              in paragraph 27(d) of PNDCL 42 
                                              referred to the Secretary for 
                                              Justice and Attorney-General as a 
                                              member of the Council. Practice 
                                              would also appear to support the 
                                              foregoing conclusions. Suppose the 
                                              PNDC appointed an Acting 
                                              Attorney-General by letter without 
                                              adding that he was also Secretary 
                                              for Justice, further appointed a 
                                              Deputy Secretary for Justice 
                                              simpliciter. If we concede to the 
                                              argument of separate offices, then 
                                              one can argue that the Acting 
                                              Attorney-General is the 
                                              subordinate of the deputy 
                                              secretary who was appointed the 
                                              Deputy Secretary for Justice and 
                                              must take ministerial instructions 
                                              from him. The Acting Chief 
                                              Director of the ministry would 
                                              also be responsible to the deputy 
                                              secretary as acting Secretary for 
                                              Justice and not to his public 
                                              service colleague, the Acting 
                                              Attorney-General. Any one 
                                              acquainted with the work 
                                              arrangements in the ministry of 
                                              justice would appreciate the 
                                              confusion which would have 
                                              followed the acceptance of that 
                                              position. A narrow interpretation 
                                              of the provisions dealing with the 
                                              appointment and assignment of 
                                              responsibility to the ministry of 
                                              justice would mean that all acts 
                                              of the acting Attorney-General as 
                                              Secretary for Justice would be 
                                              null and void. Conversely all acts 
                                              of the Deputy Secretary for 
                                              Justice as deputy principal legal 
                                              adviser to the government would 
                                              also be null and void. The broader 
                                              interpretation in our view accords 
                                              with commonsense.</span></p>

                                              It must, however, be admitted that 
                                              the argument for an 
                                              Attorney-General who is separate

                                              attractive. One of the traditional 
                                              functions entrusted to an 
                                              Attorney-General in Ghana is the 
                                              prosecution of criminal offences. 
                                              The interest of justice, it is 
                                              arguable, is better served if the 
                                              decision to prosecute is made by a 
                                              person who is not influenced by 
                                              any political party consideration. 
                                              An independent Attorney-General 
                                              with the tenor of a judge of the 
                                              superior courts would be a bulwark 
                                              against arbitrariness in 
                                              exercising the power to prosecute. 
                                              It is for these reasons that the 
                                              constitutions of some countries 
                                              provide that the minister of 
                                              Justice and the Attorney-General 
                                              or the Director of Public

                                              stature and personality of the

                                              to be attached to that office. A 
                                              minister, commissioner or a 
                                              secretary of state need not be 
                                              professionally paid or contribute 
                                              to social security or the pension 
                                              fund, but a civil servant or a 
                                              public servant is entitled to such 
                                              job security. Thus any time the 
                                              years’ standing of an 
                                              Attorney-General has been raised 
                                              by law so has there been a 
                                              proportionate hiking in his 
                                              equivalent status in the judicial 
                                              hierarchy and perquisites of 
                                              office. In reality however the 
                                              increase in year's standing on the 
                                              roll of lawyers bears no 
                                              relationship to competence. The 
                                              operative words have always laid 
                                              emphasis on date of enrolment 
                                              instead of the actual practice of 
                                              law. Experience and competence as 
                                              a lawyer can be measured from the 
                                              latter and not the former.</span></p>

                                              The constitutional history of this 
                                              country demonstrates that it has 
                                              been considered important that the 
                                              Attorney-General must also be a 
                                              minister of state or a person of 
                                              equivalent political status. We 
                                              have also shown that in 
                                              circumstances where the 
                                              Attorney-General has been stated 
                                              to be a public servant that status 
                                              has had significance only in terms 
                                              of his conditions of service. The 
                                              requirement of years' standing as 
                                              a lawyer could sacrifice 
                                              competence and experience to an 
                                              arbitracy fancy for years' 
                                              standing at the Bar per se. It is 
                                              our hope that this article has 
                                              made a modest contribution to 
                                              exposing the problems that have 
                                              beset various attempts at 
                                              formulating legal provisions on 
                                              the qualification, position and 
                                              status of the Attorney-General in 
                                              Ghana. It could serve as a guide 
                                              in formulating appropriate and 
                                              acceptable provisions for that 
                                              office in the next Republican 
                                              Constitution. It is our further 
                                              hope that the legal service will 
                                              also be given the necessary 
                                              recognition in the definition of 
                                              public services under the 
                                              constitution as the role of a 
                                              legal service in any democratic 
                                              process cannot be underestimated.&nbsp; 
                                              It is our suggestion that in view 
                                              of the doubtful legal validity of 
                                              the Legal Service Regulations 
                                              which were purportedly made 
                                              pursuant to PNDCL 42, a 
                                              substantive law should be enacted 
                                              now to govern the appointment, 
                                              promotion, remuneration, dismissal 
                                              and other conditions of service of 
                                              the legal service. The 
                                              Attorney-General and his deputy in 
                                              our view have historically and 
                                              realistically and in accordance 
                                              with existing law not been part of

                                              18 An argument could be made that 
                                              the separation of the post of 
                                              Minister of Justice from that of 
                                              Attorney-General was necessary to 
                                              ensure neutrality of the 
                                              Attorney-General who should be 
                                              uninfluenced by political party 
                                              considerations. One may however 
                                              ask why the neutrality became 
                                              necessary under self-government.&nbsp; 
                                              The fact that in Britain the 
                                              Attorney-General and 
                                              Solicitor-General were and are 
                                              ministers of state and are 
                                              invariably from the House of 
                                              Commons underscores the neutrality 
                                              arguments. It is our view that the 
                                              separation was only to give the 
                                              colonial power control over the

                                              the years acquired a broader 
                                              meaning in Ghana as a result of 
                                              the combination in one person of 
                                              both ministerial responsibility 
                                              and chief adviser to government.&nbsp; 
                                              It is in this broader 
                                              signification that the word 
                                              Attorney-General is used in PNDCL 
                                              42.</span></p>

                                              argues forcefully that under the 
                                              then applicable law, the office of 
                                              Attorney-General was not distinct 
                                              and separate from that of 
                                              Secretary for Justice.&nbsp; That 
                                              argument has been vindicated by 
                                              the provision in article 88 of the 
                                              1992 Constitution which is to
