                                              land situate in the village of

                                              relevant transaction, a 
                                              documentary conveyance of April 
                                              1976 (exhibit B), executed in 
                                              favour of the plaintiff by OK on 
                                              behalf of the Agbawe family of 
                                              Frafraha.&nbsp; The plaintiff commenced 
                                              farming on the land.&nbsp; An issue was 
                                              posed as to whether the 
                                              plaintiff’s grantor OK had been 
                                              competent to grant the land, or 
                                              whether only the La stool could 
                                              have validly made such a grant.&nbsp; 
                                              The argument was clouded by a 
                                              tendency to state the issue as 
                                              being whether the land was stool 
                                              land or family land, or as to 
                                              whether it was owned by the La 
                                              stool or the Agbawe family. Thus 
                                              Owusu v Manche of Labadi,3 in 
                                              which it had been held that 
                                              compensation on the compulsory 
                                              acquisition of La rural land was 
                                              payable to the La stool, not the 
                                              family in possession, was cited as 
                                              authority for the conclusion that 
                                              such land was stool, not family 
                                              land.&nbsp; This formulation of the 
                                              issue would seem to have presented 
                                              a false dichotomy. The allodial 
                                              title is frequently vested in both 
                                              a head stool and its sub-stools or 
                                              constituent families. In such 
                                              circumstances rights may be 
                                              exercisable variously by the head

                                              considered in detail, explained 
                                              Adade JSC, would be seen to 
                                              confirm such a dual exercise of 
                                              rights in La lands, although it 
                                              was held that the particular right 
                                              to receive compensation in that 
                                              instance was vested in the La 
                                              stool. The point in issue in the 
                                              present case concerned the quite 
                                              distinct right to make grants of 
                                              the land.&nbsp; Almost all the judges 
                                              in the case accepted that the 
                                              authorities tended towards 
                                              establishing that the La stool 
                                              alone held this right. The leading 
                                              case on the neighbouring Osu rural 
                                              land, Akwei v Awuletey,4 
                                              determined that the Osu stool 
                                              alone was competent to grant such 
                                              land.5 The La case, Adoaku v 
                                              Nyamalor6 held that it was right 
                                              to rely on an Osu case because the 
                                              customary laws of the two areas 
                                              were similar.&nbsp; However, that case 
                                              concerned quarter (or town) lands, 
                                              which in Osu, and presumably also 
                                              in La, are subject to different 
                                              rules from those governing rural 
                                              lands.&nbsp; Owusu v Manche of Labadi, 
                                              if not directly on the issue, was 
                                              indirectly favourable to the claim 
                                              of the La stool.&nbsp; Curiously, no 
                                              mention was made of the case most 
                                              directly on the point, Nii Adjei 
                                              Onano v Okoi Noi,7 which held that 
                                              La rural land might be granted by 
                                              the La stool alone.&nbsp; In the view 
                                              of the Court of Appeal and the 
                                              dissentient minority in the 
                                              Supreme Court the authorities had 
                                              conclusively determined the law.8 
                                              In the view of Taylor and Wuaku 
                                              JJSC, members of the majority in 
                                              the Supreme Court, the authorities 
                                              were strongly indicative of the 
                                              law.&nbsp; The other member of the 
                                              majority, Adade JSC, alone 
                                              concluded on the authorities that 
                                              sub-stools always had the power to 
                                              make such grants.9 For Taylor and 
                                              Wuaku JJSC, the authorities did 
                                              not so much provide an answer as 
                                              would pose a problem, when viewed 
                                              in relation to certain evidence in 
                                              the case. This evidence showed 
                                              clearly, but inconveniently, that 
                                              over a lengthy period many plots 
                                              in Frafraha and adjacent areas had 
                                              been the subject of grants by the 
                                              local heads of the Agbawe family, 
                                              and virtually none had been 
                                              granted by the La stool. Moreover, 
                                              although aware of this practice, 
                                              the La Mantse had failed to asset 
                                              effectively any claim to make such 
                                              grants.&nbsp; Thus, whether or not the 
                                              law laid down by the courts had 
                                              been in accord with the previous 
                                              social practice, it was clear that 
                                              many transactions entered into 
                                              subsequently to the judicial 
                                              declarations had been based on a 
                                              contrary view of the law. Any such 
                                              situation raises the question 
                                              whether the courts can and should 
                                              apply some legal doctrine which 
                                              will give effect to the 
                                              expectations of the parties to 
                                              such transactions even if the 
                                              courts cannot pronounce the 
                                              transactions to be fully valid.</span></p>

                                              In the present case, two such 
                                              possibilities seem to have been 
                                              considered. First the evidence of 
                                              the practice of the granting of 
                                              rural land by sub-stools might 
                                              have been taken to be evidence of 
                                              customary law, showing that the 
                                              authority to make such grants was 
                                              vested in the sub-stools.&nbsp; The 
                                              difficulty here was that the 
                                              existing case law supported the 
                                              contrary view.&nbsp; It is doubtful 
                                              whether the courts are entitled to 
                                              accept further evidence of 
                                              customary law on an issue which 
                                              falls within rules already 
                                              established by authority. It is 
                                              also questionable whether it would 
                                              be good policy to allow 
                                              authoritatively settled questions 
                                              of customary law to be re-opened 
                                              in this way.10&nbsp; This approach was 
                                              not fully adopted.&nbsp; Secondly, 
                                              there was a possibility of 
                                              employing the doctrine of estoppel 
                                              by acquiescence to modify the 
                                              strict legal conclusion in the 
                                              light of social reality.&nbsp; The 
                                              doctrine has frequently been used 
                                              for this purpose in other 
                                              contexts.11&nbsp; In the present case, 
                                              Taylor JSC, in whose reasoning 
                                              Wuaku JSC concurred, examined the 
                                              doctrine as it had been expounded 
                                              in a number of English and 
                                              Ghanaian cases, and argued that 
                                              the La stool had, by acquiescing 
                                              over a long period in the granting 
                                              of rural lands exclusively by 
                                              sub-stools, impliedly represented

                                              be obtained by taking a grant from

                                              This differs from the many other 
                                              instances of application of the 
                                              doctrine. Usually a party is 
                                              estopped as against another from 
                                              asserting title to a particular 
                                              plot as a result of acquiescence 
                                              in acts done in respect of that 
                                              plot.&nbsp; Here the argument was that 
                                              the La stool was estopped as 
                                              against all members of the public 
                                              who had taken grants of plots of 
                                              rural lands from sub-stools as a 
                                              result of its acquiescence in 
                                              grants by sub-stools of other 
                                              plots.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there would 
                                              seem to be little reason in 
                                              principle why the doctrine should 
                                              not apply in this way.&nbsp; Perhaps 
                                              the only objection may be that the 
                                              mistaken belief in such a case is 
                                              an error of law.&nbsp; It is not 
                                              certain on previous authority 
                                              whether a mistake of law can found 
                                              a plea of estoppel by 
                                              acquiescence.12a&nbsp; It is arguable 
                                              that the objection is weaker in a 
                                              case like the present where the 
                                              law in question is a local rule 
                                              with a relatively small area of 
                                              operation.&nbsp; It may be unreasonable 
                                              to expect members of the public to 
                                              be aware of all such rules.</span></p>

                                              decision is authority.&nbsp; Two 
                                              members of the court, Taylor and 
                                              Wuaku JJSC, out of the three who 
                                              decided in favour of the 
                                              plaintiff, held that a grant of La 
                                              rural land by a sub-stool was 
                                              ineffective except when the La 
                                              stool was estopped by acquiescence 
                                              from disputing it.&nbsp; The two 
                                              dissentients, Francois and 
                                              Amua-Sekyi JJSC, held that such a 
                                              grant was always ineffective. The 
                                              other member of the majority, 
                                              Adade JSC, held that it was 
                                              generally effective.&nbsp; Thus four of 
                                              the judges held that grants by a 
                                              sub-stool would be invalid in the 
                                              absence of acquiescence by the La 
                                              stool.&nbsp; But these four included 
                                              only two out of the three who 
                                              upheld the plaintiff’s appeal. 
                                              Moreover, this near consensus 
                                              postulates a condition—the absence 
                                              of acquiescence—which appears 
                                              unlikely to be often met.&nbsp; It 
                                              seems as if there will be few 
                                              instances arising for decisions in 
                                              the near future where it will not 
                                              be possible to establish 
                                              acquiescence, although the La 
                                              stool may assert and publicise its 
                                              rights and so exclude the plea of 
                                              acquiescence in respect of grants 
                                              taken from sub-stools in the 
                                              future.&nbsp; The conclusions on this 
                                              issue left doubt as to the 
                                              strength of the plaintiff’s 
                                              title.&nbsp; From this followed the

                                              plaintiff’s problem arose from his

                                              evidence that the 
                                              defendant-company was successor in 
                                              title to D or that the grant was 
                                              taken on the company’s behalf.&nbsp;

                                              For the decision of such disputes, 
                                              where each side’s case has 
                                              weaknesses, there appears to be 
                                              two different guides. A general 
                                              principle of common law is that a 
                                              plaintiff in a civil action need 
                                              do no more than establish his 
                                              claim on the balance of 
                                              probabilities to succeed.12b This 
                                              suggests that a plaintiff with a 
                                              weak case may succeed against a 
                                              defendant whose case is even 
                                              weaker. But a line of cases 
                                              typified by Kodilinye v Odu13 
                                              propounds the apparently 
                                              conflicting principle that in land 
                                              cases the plaintiff can succeed 
                                              only on the strength of his own 
                                              case, not on the weakness of the 
                                              defendant’s.&nbsp; In the present case, 
                                              the majority of the Supreme Court 
                                              adopted an argument set out in 
                                              Ricketts v Addo14 which sought to 
                                              reconcile the two principles.&nbsp; It 
                                              stated that, according to the rule 
                                              in Kodilinye v Odu, a plaintiff 
                                              could not succeed unless he 
                                              positively established some 
                                              grounds on which a court could 
                                              reasonably uphold his claim.&nbsp; But 
                                              once this initial requirement had 
                                              been met, the claims of the two 
                                              parties must be weighed against 
                                              each other, a process which 
                                              required the weaknesses of each to 
                                              be taken into account.15</span></p>

                                              The resolution of this issue 
                                              indicates the importance of a 
                                              clear answer to the further 
                                              question, what must the plaintiff 
                                              prove?&nbsp; The present case was 
                                              treated as primarily an action in 
                                              trespass, the claims to damages, 
                                              recovery of possession and an 
                                              injunction all being related to 
                                              this tort. The action is directed 
                                              at the protection of possession. 
                                              To succeed a plaintiff needs 
                                              generally to prove only that he 
                                              was in possession of the land, and 
                                              that the defendant directly 
                                              interfered with that possession.16 
                                              Thus in the present case, the 
                                              majority of the Supreme Court 
                                              recounted the plaintiff’s farming 
                                              activities on the land, showing 
                                              that he had been in possession 
                                              from the time of event (a) in 
                                              April 1976 until event (d) in or 
                                              after August 1979. (Event (c), the 
                                              entry by the defendant-company in 
                                              June 1978 had been temporary, and 
                                              had been reversed by the 
                                              plaintiff’s assertion of his 
                                              right.)17 Thus the plaintiff 
                                              discharged the initial burden on a 
                                              plaintiff in trespass.</span></p>

                                              This argument was challenged in 
                                              the dissenting judgment of 
                                              Amua-Sekyi JSC in two respects.&nbsp; 
                                              First it was contended: “The most 
                                              that can be said for the plaintiff 
                                              here is that he probably entered 
                                              the land some three weeks before 
                                              the defendants did . . .”&nbsp; The 
                                              dates of events (a) and (d) were 
                                              cited.&nbsp; With respect, this 
                                              argument seems to substitute for 
                                              the fact of possession, on which 
                                              the action in trespass is based,18 
                                              the receipt of a conveyance, which 
                                              may have no effect on the facts on 
                                              the ground.&nbsp; The second 
                                              counter-argument of Amua-Sekyi JSC 
                                              was to the effect that the 
                                              possession protected by the action 
                                              of trespass:</span></p>

                                              or two, a week, a month, or even a 
                                              year . . . It is rather long, 
                                              peaceful, undisturbed possession 
                                              over a considerable period of 
                                              time, long and peaceful enough to 
                                              raise a presumption that the 
                                              occupation of the land must have a 
                                              lawful origin.”</span></p>

                                              Again one must respectfully 
                                              question this argument. The action 
                                              in trespass protects the fact of 
                                              possession, not a title which may 
                                              be inferred from possession. The 
                                              authorities show that the action 
                                              can be founded on relatively 
                                              slight acts of possession over a 
                                              short period.19</span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">

                                              The plaintiff who proves these 
                                              facts is prima facie entitled to 
                                              succeed.&nbsp; It is not necessary to 
                                              prove title.20 However, the 
                                              outcome of a trespass action may 
                                              not eventually turn on the fact of 
                                              possession. It is a good defence 
                                              that the defendant held a title 
                                              which legally empowered him to do 
                                              the acts complained of, that is, 
                                              which conferred a better right to 
                                              possession than the plaintiff’s. 
                                              This defence is frequently raised, 
                                              and is the procedure whereby title 
                                              to land is so often put in issue 
                                              in trespass actions. In principle 
                                              the onus is at this juncture on 
                                              the defendant to prove the title 
                                              on which the defence is based.&nbsp; 
                                              However, relatively slight 
                                              evidence is sometimes enough to 
                                              nullify the effect of the 
                                              plaintiffs bare fact of 
                                              possession, and so to compel the 
                                              plaintiff in turn to produce 
                                              evidence of his title.&nbsp; Hence it 
                                              is sometimes said that the 
                                              defendant by pleading title puts 
                                              the plaintiff in trespass to the 
                                              proof of his title.&nbsp; In an action 
                                              for a declaration of title the 
                                              plaintiff’s initial burden is 
                                              different.&nbsp; The plaintiff here is 
                                              not seeking protection for 
                                              possession, but a declaratory 
                                              judgment stating that he holds a 
                                              specified title.&nbsp; Therefore the 
                                              onus is on him to show that he 
                                              holds that title. When a claim in 
                                              trespass is coupled with a claim 
                                              for a declaration of title, as in 
                                              the present case, it is quite 
                                              possible for the former to succeed 
                                              and the latter to be dismissed.21 
                                              However, in the present case, this 
                                              question was not raised.</span></p>

                                              of 1962 but co-exists with it, it 
                                              follows that grants within their 
                                              scope require the consent or

                                              would seem reasonable to suppose 
                                              that the requisite consent or 
                                              concurrence may in either case be 
                                              given after the parties have

                                              words, the transaction can carry 
                                              any legal effect before such 
                                              consent or concurrence has been 
                                              given, even if it is likely to be

                                              was not within the statutory 
                                              provisions.&nbsp; It may be replied in 
                                              relation to the Administration of 
                                              Lands Act, 1962, that it was a 
                                              “disposal ... by a stool,” namely, 
                                              the Frafraha sub-stool.&nbsp; In 
                                              relation to PNDCL 42 it may be 
                                              replied that, as suggested above, 
                                              even if in a sense this was family 
                                              land, it was also stool land.&nbsp; 
                                              Therefore this was an “assurance 
                                              of stool land” vested in the La 
                                              stool, as well as the Frafraha 
                                              sub-stool.&nbsp; Moreover, under PNDCL 
                                              42 “stool land” includes “family 
                                              land.24 This aspect of the case 
                                              points to the possibility that the 
                                              courts may start to enforce these 
                                              often disregarded provisions.25 
                                              But it also supports the 
                                              reflection that a good deal of 
                                              judicial clarification of the 
                                              statutory terms will be required 
                                              before parties to land 
                                              transactions generally can be

                                              that the Evidence Decree, 1975 (NRCD

                                              proved that the persons through

                                              land.&nbsp; This would have been enough

                                              the dispute arose.&nbsp; However, in 
                                              each case that party was able to 
                                              show that their current possession 
                                              had been preceded by unchallenged 
                                              possession over a long period.&nbsp; 
                                              The courts held that this was 
                                              sufficient to establish the 
                                              conclusion that the parties in 
                                              possession must have received 
                                              valid grants from the previous 
                                              owners, even though such grants 
                                              could not be specifically proved.&nbsp;

                                              degree of possession that the 
                                              plaintiff in a trespass action 
                                              must prove to establish a prima 
                                              facie case which would require an 
                                              answer from the defendant.&nbsp; 
                                              Francois JSC rejected the argument 
                                              based on the plaintiff’s 
                                              possession on the ground that the 
                                              plaintiff had not pleaded the fact 
                                              of possession, and so had not 
                                              based a claim upon it.&nbsp; The 
                                              majority considered that the
