                                              Whenever one talks of arrest, it 
                                              is the policeman who comes to 
                                              one's mind. Arrests are associated 
                                              with policemen but not all arrests 
                                              are made by policemen. What 
                                              constitutes an arrest in police 
                                              jargon is the taking or 
                                              restraining a person in order that 
                                              he or she may be available to 
                                              answer an alleged or suspected 
                                              offence or crime. The term arrest 
                                              was defined by a judge in a 
                                              leading case, Christie v 
                                              Leachinsky [1947] AC 573, as the 
                                              beginning of imprisonment. It 
                                              normally leads to detention which 
                                              may be prolonged. Arrest involves 
                                              depriving a person of his liberty 
                                              and his right to move about 
                                              freely. It has been defined in 
                                              legal textbooks as: the total 
                                              restraint of the liberty of 
                                              another, whether by constraining 
                                              him or compelling him to go to a 
                                              particular place, or by confining 
                                              him in a particular place, or by 
                                              detaining him in a public place.</span></p>

                                              court, or to prevent him from

                                              cases, to remove a person

                                              doing so, and those reasonable 
                                              steps would include detaining him

                                              but it is a duty of every citizen. 
                                              Under our laws, a policeman can 
                                              arrest any person who commits an 
                                              offence in his presence; the 
                                              police may also arrest any suspect 
                                              under any reasonable suspicion. 
                                              Private persons may also arrest 
                                              without warrant for any offence in 
                                              the nature of violence or the use 
                                              of force against another which is 
                                              committed in their presence. A 
                                              private person may arrest without

                                              committed in his view. He can also 
                                              arrest for any offence involving 
                                              injury to public property. Our 
                                              laws empower the owner of a 
                                              property to arrest any person who 
                                              tries to steal or injures his 
                                              property or trespasses to his 
                                              property. Any district magistrate 
                                              may arrest or direct the arrest in

                                              stated before him on oath by some

                                              person before a court. Normally, a 
                                              justice will not sanction the 
                                              issue of a warrant of arrest 
                                              unless a complaint or charge has 
                                              been made upon oath. He must 
                                              satisfy himself that there are 
                                              grounds for the arrest of the 
                                              suspect or the offender. Once the 
                                              warrant has been issued and 
                                              directed to the police, any police 
                                              officer may execute it at any 
                                              time.&nbsp; The police have powers of 
                                              discretion when arresting 
                                              offenders without warrant. Several 
                                              factors are taken into 
                                              consideration. All persons 
                                              committing serious or indictable 
                                              offences shall be arrested without 
                                              any warrant. The police can 
                                              exercise discretion not to arrest 
                                              offenders who have committed minor 
                                              or indictable offences. Such 
                                              persons may be proceeded against

                                              police officer has reasons to 
                                              doubt their names and addresses,

                                              Generally, any police officer or 
                                              other person making an arrest 
                                              shall actually touch or confine 
                                              the body of the person to be 
                                              arrested. He must also inform the 
                                              suspect of the reasons for the 
                                              arrest. Since his freedom of 
                                              movement is going to be 
                                              restricted, it is fair that the 
                                              offence is made known to him. The 
                                              police or the officer making the 
                                              arrest will point out the offence 
                                              the suspect has committed to him. 
                                              After that the police officer 
                                              should note any reply that the 
                                              suspect would give. The law does 
                                              not deal specifically with the 
                                              manner in which an arrest shall be 
                                              made, although it provides powers 
                                              to facilitate an arrest, eg to 
                                              enter or break out of premises, to 
                                              force and to call for assistance. 
                                              A police officer must not do 
                                              anything that cannot be justified 
                                              by law, eg use of unnecessary 
                                              force. But an arrested person 
                                              cannot complain that he has not 
                                              been informed of the reason for 
                                              his arrest, when he himself 
                                              contributed to the situation which 
                                              made it impracticable to inform

                                              of these police stations are

                                              be to him, he must keep his temper

                                              It is the duty of the police to 
                                              listen patiently to any member of 
                                              the public who reports at the 
                                              police station with a complaint.

                                              it should be recorded and the 
                                              station officer informed for an 
                                              immediate action to be taken.&nbsp; 
                                              After interrogating the 
                                              complainant, the station officer 
                                              can refuse cases as being civil, 
                                              trivial or vexatious and decline 
                                              to arrest the suspect. In some 
                                              cases, it will necessitate the 
                                              complainant accompanying the 
                                              police and also providing the 
                                              means of transport. Lack of 
                                              transport in nearly all the police 
                                              stations has hampered effective 
                                              police action. In most cases, the

                                              police fail to take expeditious

                                              police cannot compel him to do so. 
                                              His refusal to speak should be 
                                              recorded and this brought to the

                                              give ample guidelines as to how 
                                              prisoners in police custody should 
                                              be treated. All personal searches 
                                              should be done with care and 
                                              decency. Male prisoners should be 
                                              searched by male police officers 
                                              while no female prisoner shall be 
                                              searched except by a female. Every 
                                              person when arrested is presumed 
                                              innocent until the contrary is 
                                              proved. For this reason, the 
                                              police have been told to be 
                                              cautious when dealing with 
                                              suspected persons. When a juvenile 
                                              is arrested, all practicable steps 
                                              are taken by the police to inform 
                                              a parent or guardian. If the case 
                                              is not of a serious nature, the 
                                              station officer may release the 
                                              juvenile to the parent or guardian

                                              When the colonialists stepped on 
                                              the Ghanaian soil, the police 
                                              service was one of the first 
                                              institutions they established to 
                                              help them in their colonization. 
                                              Every police station that was 
                                              built, also had a cell or cells 
                                              for the confinement of suspects 
                                              and prisoners.&nbsp; It is regrettable 
                                              to say that all the cells in our 
                                              police stations are not good 
                                              enough except, perhaps Legon 
                                              police station.&nbsp; I say this 
                                              because it is the only police 
                                              station that has decent cells and 
                                              toilet facilities.</span></p>

                                              The question of the use of

                                              to be considered, not only when an 
                                              arrest has to be made but also in 
                                              the case of the conveyance to the

                                              places is to be avoided, to avert 
                                              possible escape. The public often 
                                              criticises the police for 
                                              unnecessary handling of suspects

                                              Some of these treatments are not 
                                              deliberate, but are due to
