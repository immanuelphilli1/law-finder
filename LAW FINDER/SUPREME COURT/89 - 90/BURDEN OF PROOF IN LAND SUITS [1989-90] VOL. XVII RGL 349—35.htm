                                              defendants. Both parties led 
                                              conflicting evidence of 
                                              traditional history as to

                                              best could only constitute 
                                              weaknesses in the defence.

                                              further pronouncements. His

                                              &quot;Since a declaration of title is 
                                              sought, it is essential that the 
                                              usual burden of proof should be 
                                              satisfactorily discharged for 
                                              success. That burden was clearly 
                                              laid in Kodilinye v Odu (1935) 2 
                                              WACA 336. That burden . . . 
                                              ensures that the plaintiff should 
                                              win on the strength of her own 
                                              case which must not be propped up 
                                              by weaknesses in the defence's 
                                              case. The principle has for 
                                              several decades been the fulcrum 
                                              for determining ownership in land 
                                              matters in our courts. In recent 
                                              times a dangerous trend has been 
                                              erupting of equating this burden 
                                              with the normal burden in a civil 
                                              case of measuring success by a 
                                              balance of probabilities. In my 
                                              view the requirement of a higher 
                                              burden of proof in land matters 
                                              cannot be whittled away by glosses 
                                              on the principle. This quality of 
                                              proof has sometimes even been 
                                              equated with proof in criminal 
                                              matters, i.e. proof beyond 
                                              reasonable doubt. Suffice to 
                                              emphasise that a high measure of 
                                              proof is necessary to sustain 
                                              victory in a plaintiff seeking a 
                                              declaration of title to land . . .

                                              to rely on the shortcomings of a 
                                              defendant in the discharge of his 
                                              obligations.&quot;5</span></p>

                                              It is suggested that the Francois

                                              The effect of these sections is to 
                                              draw a distinction between: (a) 
                                              the burden of proof in criminal 
                                              cases, i.e. proof beyond 
                                              reasonable doubt, and (b) the

                                              inter alia, that the plaintiffs 
                                              ought to have relied entirely on 
                                              the strength of their own case and 
                                              not on the weakness in the case of 
                                              the defence.</span></p>

                                              the plaintiff must rely on the 
                                              strength of his own case. It was

                                              claim which was met by the defence

                                              six weeks before Francois JSC made

                                              application of the principle that

                                              (applying the Court of Appeal 
                                              decision in the Ricketts' case) 
                                              that if the plaintiff totally 
                                              failed to make out a case for 
                                              title to land, he could not (on 
                                              application of the principle) rely 
                                              on the weakness in the defence 
                                              case. If, however, he led evidence

                                              disclosed any weakness which 
                                              tended to support the plaintiff's 
                                              claim, the plaintiff would be 
                                              entitled to rely on the weakness 
                                              in the defence case to strengthen

                                              plaintiff did make a case (even if 
                                              a weak case) bearing in mind the 
                                              fact that it was only when a 
                                              plaintiff has failed completely to

                                              comes to court no matter what the 
                                              claim is, must be able to make a

                                              What is the policy justification 
                                              or rationale for the Kodilinye 
                                              doctrine? We must not overlook the 
                                              fact that in all cases where the 
                                              so-called Kodilinye doctrine has 
                                              been applied to arrive at a 
                                              decision against the plaintiff, 
                                              the defendants have been in 
                                              possession and occupation and 
                                              exercising rights of ownership. 
                                              That was the position in the 
                                              instant case of Banga v Djanie. 
                                              Ownership carries with it the 
                                              right of possession, but 
                                              possession does not necessarily 
                                              connote right of ownership. 
                                              However, ownership is an abstract 
                                              relational concept; while 
                                              possession is a practical 
                                              demonstrable aspect of exercising 
                                              ownership rights. Herein lies the 
                                              problem. It is for such 
                                              theoretical and philosophical and 
                                              practical problems associated with 
                                              ownership and possession in the 
                                              common law that the law requires 
                                              that the person claiming 
                                              ownership, itself an abstract 
                                              thing, must produce cogent and 
                                              strong evidence to displace the 
                                              practical evidence of possession 
                                              by the defendant. The Kodilinye 
                                              principle means no more than the 
                                              practical resolution of this 
                                              theoretical, philosophical and 
                                              doctrinal underpinnings of land 
                                              law whose foundations are embedded 
                                              in feudal theories of allodial 
                                              ownership. It is suggested that 
                                              the correct statement or 
                                              explanation of the Kodilinye 
                                              principle therefore appears to be 
                                              this: Possession is a sufficient 
                                              but not a necessary condition for 
                                              claims to ownership. Therefore the 
                                              person claiming abstract rights of 
                                              ownership against the one already 
                                              in physical possession, in order 
                                              to succeed, requires more than 
                                              merely pointing to certain acts of 
                                              the one in possession (which may 
                                              be inconsistent with ownership) 
                                              and therefore may weaken his case 
                                              for claims to ownership. He is 
                                              required to do more than that. 
                                              This is not an easy task because 
                                              the concrete objective fact of 
                                              physical possession constitutes a 
                                              prima facie case for claim to 
                                              ownership. One can thus appreciate 
                                              the enormity of the burden to be 
                                              discharged. But at the end of the 
                                              day, the weaknesses of the 
                                              defendant's case will constitute 
                                              part of the evidence which the 
                                              claimant has to assemble in order 
                                              to rebut the prima facie evidence 
                                              of possession. It would seem that 
                                              pointing to such weaknesses in the 
                                              defendant's case without more 
                                              cannot be enough. It involves 
                                              weighing those acts constituting 
                                              the weakness and the fact of 
                                              possession against the claims of 
                                              the plaintiff that he is the true 
                                              owner by virtue of purchase, 
                                              succession or otherwise. This is 
                                              nothing more than proof on a 
                                              preponderance of probabilities.</span></p>

                                              interpretation of the true ambit 
                                              of the Kodilinye principle as 
                                              indicated above, is supported by 
                                              sections 10-12, particularly 
                                              section 11(4) of the Evidence

                                              to a farm sold in execution of a 
                                              judgment which had been obtained 
                                              against a member of the family. 
                                              The High Court found for the 
                                              plaintiff but on appeal, the 
                                              decision was reversed by the Court 
                                              of Appeal. On a further appeal by 
                                              the plaintiff, the Supreme Court 
                                              held (dismissing the appeal) that 
                                              in an action by a head of family 
                                              for a declaration of the family's 
                                              title to property sold in 
                                              execution of a judgment debt 
                                              obtained against a member of the 
                                              family and for setting aside the 
                                              sale, the courts must examine the 
                                              evidence with extreme caution. In 
                                              such a situation, the Supreme 
                                              Court held that a high degree of 
                                              proof must be looked for, but on a 
                                              balance of probabilities. It was 
                                              thus held that on the evidence as 
                                              a whole, the probabilities were 
                                              that the farm belonged to the 
                                              member of the family who was only 
                                              hiding behind the head of family 
                                              to get back the auctioned farm.20</span></p>
