                                              Speaking through Mark Anthony in 
                                              Julius Caeser, William Shakespeare 
                                              said of ancient Romans that &quot;the 
                                              evils&quot; that they did lived after 
                                              them. The good were often 
                                              &quot;interred with their bones.&quot; That 
                                              statement might be true of the 
                                              attitude of ancient Romans to 
                                              their dead. It does not, however, 
                                              seem to be a true reflection of 
                                              most Ghanaians' attitude to their 
                                              dead. The evils that a Ghanaian 
                                              perpetrates in his lifetime are 
                                              often interred in a &quot;befitting 
                                              burial” and in glowing tributes to 
                                              his memory. The &quot;fine things” 
                                              which would otherwise not have 
                                              been said about him in his 
                                              lifetime would be highlighted at 
                                              his funeral. It is a matter of joy 
                                              and relief for us to be spared the 
                                              feeling of uneasiness and the 
                                              seeming hypocrisy that would have 
                                              attended our efforts to pay 
                                              tribute posthumously to this great 
                                              man, Mr Justice Kobina Taylor. 
                                              What follows is a genuine attempt 
                                              to appraise in an objective 
                                              manner, the works of&nbsp; Mr Justice 
                                              Kobina Taylor who is still alive, 
                                              strong and kicking. It is not 
                                              possible to deal with all aspects 
                                              of his work but an effort would be 
                                              made to highlight what we can 
                                              consider to be some of his key 
                                              contributions to the development 
                                              of our law while on the Bench.</span></p>

                                              What stands out from Justice 
                                              Taylor's legal publications is 
                                              that he conceives of the law as a 
                                              purposive ordering of human 
                                              affairs. The adjudicative process 
                                              therefore does not consist in a 
                                              mere juristic mensuration. The 
                                              judicial process involves a 
                                              combination of logic, commonsense, 
                                              experience, social, economic and 
                                              sometimes political policy 
                                              considerations. No doubt these 
                                              factors ought to be the 
                                              inarticulate major premises of 
                                              most decisions of the courts. For 
                                              a techno-juristic approach to 
                                              judicial decision-making tends to 
                                              stifle an orderly development of 
                                              the law to meet the demands of a 
                                              progressive society. Most often 
                                              than not, common law judges, who 
                                              tend to stand out as the most 
                                              distinguished, such as for 
                                              example, Lord Mansfield CJ, Lords 
                                              Esher MR, Lord Atkin of Liversidge

                                              dynamic development of the law, 
                                              Taylor did not allow himself, 
                                              while on the Bench, to be fettered 
                                              by slavish adherence to authority. 
                                              So convinced is Taylor about the 
                                              need to apply and interpret the 
                                              law in such a way as to prevent 
                                              miscarriage of justice that he 
                                              would decline to follow a 
                                              precedent which would otherwise be 
                                              binding on him. He does not, 
                                              however, do so arbitrarily. He 
                                              would find a legal justification 
                                              in refusing to follow it. A close 
                                              examination of some of his 
                                              memorable decisions would disclose 
                                              his enlightened attitude to the 
                                              doctrine of judicial precedent.

                                              When Justice Taylor was elevated 
                                              from the Attorney-General's 
                                              Department to the Bench as a High 
                                              Court judge in 1969, he was soon 
                                              to be transferred to Kumasi. 
                                              There, he decided one of his 
                                              memorable cases, Nkrumah v Manu,3 
                                              on 7 December 1970, just about a 
                                              year after his appointment. This 
                                              case stands out today as one of 
                                              the most comprehensive case law 
                                              exposition of the customary law of 
                                              defamation; and together with 
                                              Billa v Salifu ([1971] 2 GLR 87) 
                                              they constitute the first and the 
                                              best explanation of the choice of 
                                              law rules as contained in 
                                              paragraph 64 of the Courts Decree, 
                                              1966 (NLCD 84) now section 49 of 
                                              the Courts Act, 1971.4 It was in 
                                              this case that the first signs of 
                                              his greatness as a judge became 
                                              manifest. In Nkrumah v Manu, the 
                                              plaintiff-respondent was called a 
                                              slave by the defendant-appellant 
                                              during a heated quarrel in which 
                                              both parties exchanged insults. In 
                                              the ensuing action for slander, 
                                              the district magistrate awarded 
                                              the plaintiff N¢80 which he 
                                              described as special damages. It 
                                              was submitted on appeal that the 
                                              district magistrate's description 
                                              of the sum awarded as special 
                                              damages meant that he had applied 
                                              the common law. Hence his decision 
                                              was wrong as no special damage was 
                                              proved. Apparently, the legal 
                                              basis for this submission is that 
                                              the common law of slander requires 
                                              as a basis for liability, proof of 
                                              special damage. However, it was 
                                              not clear as to whether the 
                                              customary law or the common law 
                                              was applicable. If the former was 
                                              the applicable law in which case 
                                              slander is actionable per se, then 
                                              the decision would be right. The 
                                              issue for determination therefore 
                                              was whether the customary law or 
                                              the common law was applicable.</span></p>

                                              &quot;Clearly the district magistrate 
                                              may have misdescribed the award as 
                                              special damages instead of damages 
                                              simpliciter. But I think it will 
                                              be a travesty of justice if I were 
                                              to rest my decision on this 
                                              unworthy ground. If for this 
                                              obvious slip I were to allow the 
                                              appeal as counsel has urged me to

                                              thereafter to any sense of justice 
                                              and fair play. Surely such 
                                              bewildering technical notions of 
                                              law were buried long ago with 
                                              Maitland's Forms of Action. I will 
                                              certainly not be a party to 
                                              conjuring up their ghosts to rule

                                              which is between two natives.&quot; 
                                              Taylor rightly pointed out that

                                              birth of the First Republic went 
                                              the demise of the Courts 
                                              Ordinance, Cap 4 and its successor 
                                              in title, so to speak, became the 
                                              Courts Act, 1966 (CA 9), s 66 
                                              which was concerned primarily with

                                              At the district court, the guide 
                                              as to the choice of law provided 
                                              above was overlooked. It could be 
                                              noted that NLCD 84 came into 
                                              effect five years before Nkrumah v 
                                              Manu was decided. Yet the 
                                              determination of issues in civil 
                                              proceedings had gone on without 
                                              any serious advertence to these 
                                              rules as a guide to the choice of 
                                              law. However, Taylor took the bold 
                                              and unprecedented step in this 
                                              case to criticise the decision of 
                                              the Court of Appeal in Attiase v 
                                              Abobbtey7 in which the choice of 
                                              law rules were ignored. Taylor 
                                              pointed out that the principle 
                                              upon which that case was decided 
                                              amounted to the revival of the 
                                              principle which the legislature 
                                              had discarded by re-enacting 
                                              section 66 of the Courts Act, 1960 
                                              (CA 9) which became paragraph 64 
                                              of NLCD 84. Referring to the

                                              The learned High Court judge, 
                                              barely a year on the Bench then, 
                                              quoted the relevant wrong

                                              stop there. He proceeded to 
                                              demonstrate that one of the cases 
                                              relied upon by the Court of Appeal 
                                              in Attiase v Abobbtey, ie Ampong v 
                                              Aboraa9 was incorrectly applied. 
                                              He declared that Smith J did not 
                                              decide any such thing in Ampong v 
                                              Aboraa as the Court of Appeal 
                                              ascribed to him. If indeed he did, 
                                              he would have been right at that 
                                              time. After 1 July 1960, however, 
                                              that decision would not be good 
                                              law to be applicable to cases 
                                              commenced and decided after that 
                                              date. Consequently he argued, by 
                                              29 July 1969, the date of Attiase 
                                              v Abobbtey&nbsp; “ the new doctrine 
                                              enshrined in paragraph 64 of NLCD 
                                              84 was the new principle.&quot; Mr

                                              fact that the authority of the 
                                              Attiase case was binding on him. 
                                              But on the basis of his analysis 
                                              he thought that in so far as the 
                                              observation of Ollennu JA could be 
                                              interpreted as part of the ratio 
                                              decidendi and to mean that 
                                              paragraph 64 of NLCD 84 was not 
                                              the true rule and that it operated 
                                              side by side with the old 
                                              discarded rule contained in the 
                                              supposed ratio in Ampong v Aboraa, 
                                              then to the extent to which the 
                                              old rule was applied, that 
                                              decision was given per incuriam</span></p>

                                              Applying the new guide as

                                              nothing on record to show that the 
                                              plaintiff had claimed to have the 
                                              issue determined according to 
                                              customary law nor did she show 
                                              that she was subject to any system 
                                              of customary law. For this reason 
                                              the exception to Rule 6 of 
                                              paragraph 64(1) of NLCD 84 was 
                                              clearly inapplicable.</span></p>

                                              judgment of the Court of Appeal 
                                              which he concluded was given per

                                              unprecedented in the courts at the 
                                              lower hierarchy. But at the end of 
                                              it we have the most comprehensive 
                                              exposition of the choice of law 
                                              rules and an excellent explanation 
                                              of the customary law of slander in 
                                              a single case.</span></p>

                                              acclaims a decision as binding and 
                                              authoritative and yet subjects it 
                                              to criticism. The principle of 
                                              stare decisis as I understand it, 
                                              prohibits such public ventilation 
                                              of dissent sometimes dragged to 
                                              lengths of decrial . . . If this

                                              authority of a precedent may be 
                                              whittled away by gradual and 
                                              piecemeal judicial nibbling. The 
                                              judge's duty to allay doubts with 
                                              positive decisions would then have

                                              judicial hierarchy. The case of 
                                              Harlley v Ejura Farms (Ghana) 
                                              Ltd15 provides a classic example. 
                                              In 1977, while still a High Court 
                                              judge, he was invited to sit on 
                                              the full bench of the Court of 
                                              Appeal as an additional judge in 
                                              order to review a decision of the 
                                              ordinary bench of the Court of 
                                              Appeal. That was in Harlley v 
                                              Ejura Farms (Ghana) Ltd where one 
                                              of the technical grounds on which 
                                              the application for review was 
                                              opposed as not being properly 
                                              before the full bench was that the 
                                              applicant had failed to comply 
                                              with the Practice Direction of the 
                                              Chief Justice. The objection was 
                                              raised that the applicant had not 
                                              stated precisely the nature of the 
                                              miscarriage of justice complained 
                                              about and that the applicant had 
                                              failed to meet the test laid down 
                                              in A/S Norway Cement Export Ltd v

                                              which the respondents were relying 
                                              to oust the jurisdiction of the 
                                              court was stated by Apaloo JA (as 
                                              he then was) as follows:</span></p>

                                              committee made no rules to govern

                                              review. We think that the practice 
                                              directive issued by the Chief 
                                              Justice on 15 May 1973 in 
                                              consultation with his brother 
                                              justices should be deemed a 
                                              modification of rules 11 and 12 of 
                                              CI 13 by the court within the true 
                                              intendment of section 6 of the 
                                              Courts (Amendment) Decree, 1972. 
                                              It is not reasonable to hold that 
                                              the legislature intends that the 
                                              machinery of the courts should 
                                              grind to a halt, if the rules 
                                              committee, through inertia, 
                                              oversight or otherwise, omitted to 
                                              make rules to govern the conduct 
                                              of any particular legal 
                                              transaction. In such situations, 
                                              reason suggests that the court 
                                              should be enabled to formulate and 
                                              give directions as to its 
                                              procedure. Rule 38 of LI 218, 
                                              gives the court power to act in 
                                              such cases and this is repeated in

                                              applicants, an assumption of 
                                              legislative power by the Chief

                                              the same line of reasoning which 
                                              the Chief Justice had adopted. He 
                                              therefore set down in his own

                                              considerations, the first of which 
                                              is whether power given to the 
                                              court can be equated with power in 
                                              the Chief Justice exercisable in 
                                              consultation with his brother 
                                              judges. With the greatest respect, 
                                              I find it difficult to appreciate 
                                              how power exercised by the Chief 
                                              Justice in consultation with his 
                                              brother judges can be deemed to be 
                                              the exercise of a statutory power 
                                              vested in the court.</span></p>

                                              The second consideration is that 
                                              the Norway Cement case is a 
                                              decision of the full bench and by 
                                              virtue of the provisions of 
                                              article 109(3) of the 
                                              Constitution, 1969, the full bench 
                                              is in principle bound by its 
                                              previous decisions. What then is 
                                              the binding effect of a previous 
                                              decision of the full bench. In my 
                                              humble opinion, it is only the 
                                              principle or reason in a decision 
                                              which necessarily supports the 
                                              conclusion of the court that is 
                                              binding and not merely the 
                                              conclusion.”19</span></p>

                                              In other words, if the reasons do 
                                              not support the conclusion then 
                                              those reasons are not binding.</span></p>

                                              Here, once again as we saw in 
                                              Nkrumah v Manu, Taylor was at his 
                                              best. He took the opportunity to 
                                              place under scrutiny another 
                                              decision of the full bench of the 
                                              Court of Appeal and with such 
                                              force and lucidity that it became 
                                              apparent that the full bench was 
                                              wrong in its decision and Taylor, 
                                              the High Court judge, was right 
                                              although on this occasion he was 
                                              doing so as an additional judge of 
                                              the full bench. In concluding that 
                                              it is only where the reasons 
                                              support the conclusions that these 
                                              reasons could be binding on a 
                                              lower court and the full bench

                                              After further examination of other 
                                              respectable persuasive authorities 
                                              on the binding effect of a ratio 
                                              decidendi, he demonstrated that 
                                              the Practice Direction issued by 
                                              the Chief Justice on 15 May 1973 
                                              in consultation with his brother 
                                              justices and upon which the 
                                              respondent was relying to oust the 
                                              jurisdiction of the court could 
                                              not be deemed in law, as the full 
                                              court had decided, to have 
                                              modified rules 11 and 12 of CI 13 
                                              within the intendment of section 6 
                                              of the Courts Amendment Decree, 
                                              1972. On the basis of his analysis 
                                              and the authorities, he concluded 
                                              that in the Norway Cement case, 
                                              the principle which enabled a 
                                              power given to the court to be 
                                              exercised by another body was 
                                              never indicated or expressed; and 
                                              that in any case, the Norway 
                                              Cement case was a single and the 
                                              only case dealing with the 
                                              construction of statutory 
                                              provisions enabling the Supreme 
                                              Court Rules, 1970, to be modified. 
                                              In that circumstance it was 
                                              difficult to say that that case 
                                              laid down any principle on the 
                                              issue of the modification of the 
                                              Supreme Court Rules, 1970, which 
                                              could be said to be binding on a

                                              Mr Justice Taylor in his 
                                              characteristic thoroughness and 
                                              his exhaustive and meticulous 
                                              approach to judicial 
                                              decision-making would leave 
                                              nothing to chance. He concluded 
                                              this aspect of his judgment by 
                                              saying that even if the opinion he 
                                              had then expressed on the validity 
                                              of the Practice Direction was 
                                              wrong, and therefore the latter 
                                              was valid, nevertheless, it would 
                                              seem to him that the respondent 
                                              had misconceived the legal effect 
                                              of a failure to comply with the 
                                              Directive in regard to miscarriage 
                                              of justice. Taylor's view was that 
                                              having regard to section 3(2) of 
                                              NRCD 101, which clothed the full 
                                              bench with jurisdiction to review 
                                              and determine any decision of the 
                                              ordinary bench of the Court of 
                                              Appeal &quot;where it appears to a full 
                                              bench of such court that there has 
                                              been a miscarriage of justice,&quot;&nbsp; 
                                              the full bench could proceed to 
                                              review although the applicant did 
                                              not state that he was proceeding 
                                              on grounds of miscarriage of 
                                              justice nor did he indicate the 
                                              nature of the miscarriage of 
                                              justice. The reason for this 
                                              conclusion, he argued, was that 
                                              the Practice Direction could not 
                                              overrule the statutory provision

                                              portray him once again as a judge 
                                              with a sound logical acumen, a

                                              haunt some of our timorous judges 
                                              who appear to tremble at the feet

                                              Our discussion of Taylor's 
                                              attitude to the binding effect of 
                                              judicial precedent and

                                              Ankrah.22 Although a dissenting 
                                              judgment, it is perhaps one of his 
                                              best in terms of industry, 
                                              research and logical analysis. The 
                                              case concerned the scope and the 
                                              extent of the head of family's 
                                              immunity to account under 
                                              customary law. The case involved 
                                              the Mantse Ankrah family 
                                              comprising three branches, ie 
                                              Ankrah, Ayi and the Okanta 
                                              branches. They maintained an 
                                              account at the Ghana Commercial 
                                              Bank, High Street, Accra. It was 
                                              operated by the parties on the 
                                              mandate of the family. The first 
                                              respondent was the overall head of 
                                              the family. Any two of them could 
                                              operate the account. In 1977 an 
                                              amount of ¢15,968.98 received by 
                                              the family as compensation for 
                                              family land compulsorily acquired 
                                              by the government was paid into 
                                              the account. But the overall head 
                                              of the family paid into his 
                                              personal account and not into the 
                                              designated family account a 
                                              further sum of ¢160,547.40 
                                              received from the government on 
                                              behalf of the family. The two 
                                              appellants in their capacities as 
                                              heads of the Ankrah and the Okanta 
                                              branches, brought an action in the 
                                              High Court against the overall 
                                              head and the head of the Ayi 
                                              branch for an account of their 
                                              expenditure of the ¢15,968.95, 
                                              part of which they claimed the 
                                              respondents had spent on Homowo 
                                              festivities against their express 
                                              opposition. They also sought an 
                                              order for the ¢160,547.40 received 
                                              on behalf of the family to be paid 
                                              into the designated family bank 
                                              account. </span></p>

                                              The respondents raised a 
                                              preliminary objection to the 
                                              propriety of the action on the 
                                              grounds that they were not 
                                              accountable at customary law to 
                                              the appellants in court. The trial 
                                              judge overruled the objection and 
                                              ordered the respondents to pay the

                                              relied upon for their objection 
                                              was of questionable authority and 
                                              besides, was inapplicable because

                                              held, inter alia, that the first

                                              the Mantse Ankrah family, was not 
                                              accountable to the appellants and 
                                              therefore allowed the appeal and

                                              All students of the customary law 
                                              are familiar with the head of the 
                                              family unaccountability rule 
                                              supposedly established in Abude v 
                                              Onano and which is claimed to be 
                                              based on the interpretation of 
                                              Sarbah's statement of the law. The 
                                              rule is perhaps, the most 
                                              criticised aspect of the customary 
                                              law. Few modern commentators on 
                                              the subject have had anything to 
                                              commend it. The opportunity was 
                                              presented in Hansen v Ankrah for 
                                              the Supreme Court to jettison the 
                                              discredited doctrine, but it was 
                                              frustrated. However, Taylor and 
                                              Apaloo CJ would never be part of

                                              determination was whether or not 
                                              the trial High Court judge was 
                                              right in his view that Abude v 
                                              Onano was of questionable

                                              cases and that the courts have 
                                              been misinterpreting what Sarbah 
                                              had written of junior members of 
                                              the family's capacity to sue the

                                              Supreme Court, we are now obliged 
                                              by the fundamental law governing 
                                              our decisions to operate the 
                                              common law doctrine of judicial 
                                              precedent in a much more modern 
                                              discriminating manner, and 
                                              hopefully less rigidly than the 
                                              other courts in our judicial

                                              The task of the Supreme Court, as 
                                              Taylor pointed out, had been made 
                                              easier by the fact that the 
                                              Supreme Court had constitutional 
                                              authority to depart from a 
                                              previous decision &quot;when it appears 
                                              right to do so.&quot;26 But this was

                                              Surprisingly, the Supreme Court, 
                                              by a majority of three to two, per 
                                              Sowah JSC (as he then was), 
                                              Francois and Mensa Boison JJA (Apaloo 
                                              CJ and Taylor JSC dissenting), 
                                              confirmed and approved the family 
                                              head's unaccountability rule. In 
                                              doing so the majority failed to 
                                              take into account the 
                                              socio-economic conditions which 
                                              the rule reflected in Sarbah's day 
                                              and age when it was supposedly 
                                              formulated; and the Supreme Court 
                                              achieved this result by relying on 
                                              what it considered to be a long 
                                              line of authority that had 
                                              crystallised into the rule. The 
                                              Chief Justice, Mr Justice Apaloo 
                                              would not be part of it, and 
                                              Taylor JSC supported him ably. In 
                                              its decision, the Supreme Court, 
                                              per Sowah JSC, held that the 
                                              customary law rule that a head of 
                                              family, who symbolised the hopes 
                                              and aspirations of the family 
                                              which constituted the core of 
                                              Ghanaian society, was not 
                                              accountable in court to the writ 
                                              of a member of the family, whether 
                                              a principal or otherwise, while he 
                                              still held the status of a head. 
                                              This rule was reasonable and 
                                              justifiable because the head 
                                              should have the capacity to handle 
                                              the routine orders and disorders 
                                              of the family. The head of the 
                                              family was however, accountable to 
                                              the family at a family meeting for 
                                              his stewardship. Consequently, a 
                                              member of the family who 
                                              considered that an incumbent head 
                                              of family was incompetent, 
                                              irresponsible or frivolous in the 
                                              handling of family matters or was 
                                              dissipating family funds could 
                                              ventilate his grievances against 
                                              the head at a family meeting.</span></p>

                                              Before discussing the response of 
                                              the minority view we deem it 
                                              appropriate to point out some 
                                              logical fallacy in the reasoning 
                                              by which the conclusion was 
                                              reached in the majority judgment. 
                                              There would seem to be no logical 
                                              nexus between the family head’s 
                                              capacity “to handle the routine 
                                              orders and disorders of the 
                                              family” and his unaccountability 
                                              in court to the writ of a member 
                                              of the family. How does his 
                                              accountability affect his capacity 
                                              to handle the routine orders and 
                                              disorders? This has not been made 
                                              out by the Supreme Court. This 
                                              would seem to be a reductio ad

                                              of the issue in the light of

                                              discourse under his sub-heading of

                                              also examined his views, inter

                                              in his book.29 From the analysis 
                                              of the text, Taylor formulated 
                                              five principles governing the 
                                              duties, rights and privileges of 
                                              an Akan head of family. The 
                                              learned judge found it remarkable 
                                              that with the exception of the 
                                              admirable judgment of Amua-Sekyi J 
                                              (as he then was) in the case30 in 
                                              most of the judgments in which the 
                                              judges had had the occasion to 
                                              rely on Sarbah's statement to 
                                              elucidate the alleged immunity 
                                              rule, including the judgment of

                                              Sarbah meant had been emasculated

                                              What must be considered as 
                                              Taylor's contribution to our 
                                              correct appreciation of the 
                                              so-called immunity doctrine is his 
                                              lucid discussion of the issue of 
                                              the common law principle that a 
                                              claim for account cannot be made 
                                              against a person who is not an 
                                              accounting party. As he explained, 
                                              the principle is not peculiar to 
                                              our customary laws.&nbsp; &quot;It is in 
                                              fact nothing more than a trite 
                                              common law principle well known to 
                                              the jurisprudence of many nations, 
                                              ancient and modern.&quot; He did 
                                              explain that the head of family 
                                              was an accounting party to the 
                                              whole family or the senior 
                                              members, but he was not, without 
                                              more, an accounting party to the 
                                              junior members, consequently the 
                                              use of the word &quot;junior&quot; by Sarbah 
                                              was deliberate and understandable. 
                                              &quot;I will venture to think that if a 
                                              junior member can by virtue of the 
                                              lawful dealings with the family 
                                              property,&quot; he observed, &quot;brings 
                                              the head within the compass of an 
                                              accounting party, he can maintain 
                                              the supposed proscribed action for 
                                              account against the head.&quot; Indeed 
                                              if the majority had had a correct 
                                              appreciation of these views, they 
                                              would have recognised that there 
                                              was sufficient ground for 
                                              discarding the discreditable 
                                              doctrine. In the opinion of the

                                              unaccountability rule has had the 
                                              blessing of the superior courts of 
                                              the land, it was binding upon all 
                                              courts, except perhaps the Supreme 
                                              Court. In any event it had so 
                                              crystallised and solidified into a 
                                              rule of customary law that only

                                              by &quot;hallowed practice.&quot; This 
                                              should be the case even where the 
                                              precedent is demonstrably unjust 
                                              and does not mirror the 
                                              present-day social and economic 
                                              conditions. This is the sort of 
                                              conclusion that is totally 
                                              unacceptable to Mr Justice Kobina

                                              In Taylor's view, the operation of 
                                              such a rule as the Supreme Court 
                                              had thus confirmed would be 
                                              incompatible with national 
                                              aspirations inherent in the need 
                                              to infuse probity and 
                                              accountability into the public and 
                                              private lives of the populace as 
                                              well as the necessity to 
                                              discourage corrupt practices and 
                                              the abuse of power, whether 
                                              discretionary or mandatory as 
                                              would seem to be prescribed by 
                                              sections 1(1)(c) and 61 of PNDCL

                                              Taylor indorsed fully the view,

                                              honourably deprecates.&quot; We must 
                                              point out that in our humble 
                                              opinion, the position taken by 
                                              Apaloo CJ and Taylor JSC would 
                                              seem to be unimpeachable. The 
                                              majority decision of the Supreme 
                                              Court would seem to be based 
                                              entirely on the need to protect 
                                              the dignity and the integrity of 
                                              the head of family as the 
                                              &quot;fountain of honour.&quot; But that is 
                                              why the decision of the majority 
                                              is difficult to explain. When the 
                                              head of family is being sued for 
                                              an account, his integrity and 
                                              honour is called into question. 
                                              The court, as the independent 
                                              arbiter would seem to be the best 
                                              institution to restore that 
                                              dignity when an innocent head 
                                              would render a clean account to 
                                              clear his name and restore his 
                                              honour and dignity. For a head of 
                                              family to refuse to render 
                                              accounts to the family in court 
                                              and for the court to support and 
                                              protect him from submitting 
                                              himself to the judicial process is 
                                              to condone wrongly, moral 
                                              turpitude and dishonesty. Rather 
                                              than protect the family head’s 
                                              integrity, dignity and honour, it 
                                              would undermine it irreparably.

                                              It should be pointed out that the 
                                              unfortunate decision by the 
                                              Supreme Court in Hansen v Ankrah, 
                                              is a result of techno-juristic 
                                              approach to the treatment of the 
                                              issues involved in the case. At 
                                              that level of adjudication, a 
                                              dynamic and interstitial judicial 
                                              decision-making is called for. 
                                              Indeed, we deem it fit to 
                                              illuminate some of the factors 
                                              which the majority of the court 
                                              failed to take into account in 
                                              their decision. Importantly, the 
                                              judges failed to recognise that 
                                              accounting in the sense of a 
                                              formal record of the debits and 
                                              credits relating to the person 
                                              named at the head of the ledger 
                                              account, or a balance of a 
                                              specified period's receipts and 
                                              expenditure is an economic concept 
                                              denoting a certain historically 
                                              determined level of society's 
                                              socio-economic development. 
                                              Accounting in this formal sense 
                                              imports a highly organised and 
                                              complex social system of 
                                              production. Keeping records of 
                                              account or book-keeping has been 
                                              known to many organised societies 
                                              that preceded the capitalist age. 
                                              But it is under the latter system 
                                              that accounting as a legal and 
                                              economic concept attained maturity 
                                              reflecting the higher, more 
                                              complex nature of its

                                              subsistence economies. Under such

                                              Therefore when Sarbah's work is 
                                              relied upon today as the basis for 
                                              the proposition that under the 
                                              indigenous law the head of the 
                                              family cannot be sued for an 
                                              account, that could only be a 
                                              statement of principle reflecting 
                                              the social norms of Sarbah’s day

                                              anachronistic. The absurdity of 
                                              such a rule in the face of the 
                                              drastic metamorphosis that 
                                              Ghanaian societies have undergone 
                                              under the influence of Western 
                                              education and its supporting 
                                              capitalist ordering of society is 
                                              self-evident. It is gratifying 
                                              that Apaloo CJ and Taylor JSC 
                                              recognised this absurdity having 
                                              regard to socio-economic changes 
                                              over the last hundred years. That 
                                              is why Apaloo CJ points out that 
                                              afterall, &quot;the laws must adapt 
                                              itself to changing social 
                                              conditions and those precedents 
                                              are inapplicable to modern 
                                              conditions.&quot; The dissenting 
                                              judgment of Mr Justice Taylor once 
                                              more reveals and demonstrates his 
                                              aversion to slavish adherence to 
                                              authority as was shown early in 
                                              his career on the Bench in Nkrumah 
                                              v Manu (supra) and later in 
                                              Harlley v Ejura Farms (Ghana) Ltd 
                                              (supra). As he does point out 
                                              often, in its traditional setting, 
                                              it is not every pronouncement of 
                                              an appellate or higher court that 
                                              is binding on lower courts by 
                                              virtue of the doctrine of judicial 
                                              precedent. It is rather the ratio 
                                              decidendi of the case logically 
                                              and demonstrably supporting the 
                                              decision that is so binding on 
                                              subsequent lower courts. It is a 
                                              feather in their caps that the 
                                              correctness of the dissenting 
                                              opinions of Apaloo CJ and Taylor

                                              Mr Justice Kobina Taylor's 
                                              attitude to the doctrine of stare 
                                              decisis is largely influenced by 
                                              his burning desire to be fair and 
                                              just in the adjudicative process. 
                                              This seems to constitute the main 
                                              source of his inspiration to carry 
                                              out exhaustive, thorough and 
                                              critical examination of all cases. 
                                              That is why Taylor would always 
                                              find an &quot;interesting legal 
                                              proposition&quot; or an &quot;interesting 
                                              legal issue&quot; in every case. To him 
                                              no case is simple. They are all of 
                                              equal importance. It is simply a 
                                              question of degree. As we have 
                                              pointed out earlier, such traits 
                                              could be found in all the great 
                                              judges who have made monumental 
                                              and indelible marks on the 
                                              development of the law. Their 
                                              formative influence on the law has 
                                              been a result of their 
                                              characteristic boldness as of the 
                                              kind to be found in Kobina Taylor.

                                              It should be pointed out that it 
                                              is when a judge conceives of the 
                                              law in the adjudicative process as 
                                              does Justice Taylor, not merely as 
                                              juristic mensuration, but as a 
                                              purposive ordering of human 
                                              affairs, that he can play his role 
                                              meaningfully in the judicial 
                                              process. He would then be in a 
                                              position to make the “hard coin of 
                                              social facts,” and not mere “paper 
                                              legalities,” the cornerstone of 
                                              his judicial decision making. The 
                                              recognition of socio-economic 
                                              conditions as the determinants of 
                                              the essence and content of the law 
                                              and the realisation that they are 
                                              inter-dependent and do overlap are 
                                              crucial to sound and realistic 
                                              judgment. It is gratifying to note 
                                              that Kobina Taylor had proved 
                                              himself on the Bench to have come 
                                              to grips with the problems of 
                                              balancing social facts with legal 
                                              rules. Changing social conditions 
                                              did form the inarticulate major 
                                              premises of most of his decisions

                                              the demands of modern times. When 
                                              village communities were small and 
                                              the written word was unknown to 
                                              customary law, the only means of 
                                              social and commercial intercourse 
                                              was the spoken word .It was 
                                              therefore essential for the 
                                              preservation of the peace of those 
                                              small communities that idle 
                                              insults which ridicule and may 
                                              therefore ruin a person be 
                                              discouraged by the body politic. 
                                              With the very drastic changes 
                                              which modern civilisation has 
                                              imposed on community and rural 
                                              life throughout the country it 
                                              seems to me that the law has more 
                                              serious problems to tackle than 
                                              silly vituperation.&quot; </span></p>

                                              It is often said that a genius is 
                                              never born. About 90 per cent of 
                                              his making is the result of hard 
                                              work. Mr Justice Kobina Taylor’s 
                                              achievements provide a classic 
                                              example of the validity of that 
                                              statement. His early life was 
                                              characterised by a determined 
                                              struggle to succeed in life. That 
                                              determination to succeed and a 
                                              burning desire to get at the truth 
                                              have helped to develop in him a 
                                              spirit of inquiry. He has an 
                                              insatiable appetite for knowledge.</span></p>

                                              This constitutes the driving force 
                                              behind his impulse for hard work 
                                              and industry. This leads him on to 
                                              carry out thorough research on the 
                                              area of law concerned in every 
                                              case. Taylor would go on a voyage 
                                              of discovery throughout the common 
                                              law jurisdictions – from Africa to 
                                              Australia, United States of 
                                              America, the United Kingdom and

                                              statutes, textbooks and archival 
                                              materials are hardly overlooked by 
                                              him if they are relevant to the

                                              Having been transferred from 
                                              Kumasi to Tamale soon after his 
                                              decision in Nkrumah v Manu, Taylor 
                                              was soon to establish himself as 
                                              one of the most diligent and 
                                              industrious judges who no serious 
                                              student of the law could ignore. 
                                              This was confirmed in one of his 
                                              first but important judgments at 
                                              Tamale in Billa v Salifu. In that 
                                              case, a district magistrate in 
                                              Tamale had awarded the plaintiff 
                                              N¢260 in damages against the 
                                              defendant for adultery with the 
                                              plaintiff’s wife. In his statement 
                                              of claim at the district court, 
                                              the plaintiff claimed that the

                                              On appeal to the High Court, the 
                                              meticulous judge as Taylor was, he 
                                              did not assume that Dagomba 
                                              customary law was automatically 
                                              applicable. He drew attention to 
                                              the fact that as a condition for 
                                              its application, direct evidence 
                                              ought to be led in accordance with 
                                              paragraph 64(1), rule 6 of the 
                                              Courts Decree, 1966 (NLCD 84) 
                                              showing that the plaintiff was 
                                              subject to a particular system of 
                                              customary law and claimed to have 
                                              the issue determined according to 
                                              that particular system of law. 
                                              This set the stage for further 
                                              elaboration, explanation and 
                                              application of the choice of law 
                                              rules prescribed under NLCD 84. 
                                              Taylor satisfied himself that the 
                                              plaintiff was subject to Dagomba 
                                              customary law. The problem he 
                                              faced was, however, the 
                                              determination of the essence and 
                                              content of that law. Making an

                                              Thus for the first time since it 
                                              was enacted in 1966, Taylor became 
                                              the first judge to call into 
                                              service paragraph 65 of the Courts 
                                              Decree, 1966 (NLCD 84). By 
                                              resorting to that provision in 
                                              order to determine the relevant 
                                              Dagomba customary law, Taylor 
                                              brought together two of the key 
                                              elders of the Dagomba Traditional 
                                              Area supposed to be repositories 
                                              of Dagomba customary law. They 
                                              were the Wula-Na, the chief 
                                              linguist in the court of the 
                                              Gulkpe-Na who was the Dagomba 
                                              Chief of Tamale and the Zobogu-Na, 
                                              a Dagomba sectorial chief of 
                                              Tamale. Both men were made to 
                                              appear on subpoena to give their 
                                              opinions, inter alia, on the 
                                              nature of adultery under Dagomba 
                                              customary laws and the remedies or 
                                              penalties, if any, associated with 
                                              it. However, Taylor was not 
                                              content to rely on their evidence 
                                              alone for his decision. He 
                                              therefore in his characteristic, 
                                              meticulous and exhaustive manner 
                                              formulated, on the basis of the 
                                              traditional evidence they gave, 
                                              six sets of questionnaire which 
                                              were submitted to the Dagomba 
                                              Traditional Council for its 
                                              written opinion in accordance with 
                                              the proviso to paragraph 65(3)(b) 
                                              of NLCD 84. Yet that was not the 
                                              end of Taylor's voyage of 
                                              discovery.35 </span></p>

                                              Taylor also spent his time combing 
                                              the archives of Tamale. The end 
                                              result of the painstaking inquiry 
                                              is that for the first time in 
                                              Ghana we have recorded in a case, 
                                              a fairly comprehensive statement 
                                              of the law on an important aspect 
                                              of Dagomba family law. As a result 
                                              of this we now have the knowledge 
                                              that under Dagomba customary law, 
                                              until a mother's child has began 
                                              to walk after its delivery, it is 
                                              not permissible for the husband to 
                                              have sexual intercourse with his 
                                              wife. This is called bia naba 
                                              tuuba, meaning the child's feet 
                                              have come together, ie the child 
                                              is able to stand on his feet. When 
                                              the child begins to walk, the 
                                              first sexual intercourse which the 
                                              man has with his wife is called 
                                              bia zugu yagbu. The term is also 
                                              applicable to sexual intercourse 
                                              which an adulterer has with a 
                                              man's wife after she has delivered 
                                              and the baby is under age and the 
                                              husband has not yet had his bia 
                                              zugu yagbu. This is a taboo which 
                                              customarily dissolves the 
                                              marriage.</span></p>

                                              These are rules the details of 
                                              which we need not go into here. 
                                              They are contained in the judgment 
                                              to be read by all interested 
                                              persons. It is interesting to 
                                              observe however that the rules and 
                                              the social norms vividly reflect a 
                                              system of social regulations that 
                                              involve a mechanism for birth 
                                              control in Dagomba society. This 
                                              must be of considerable interest 
                                              to anthropologists, lawyers, 
                                              social and health workers alike. 
                                              But of considerable interest and 
                                              importance is also the discovery 
                                              that under Dagomba customary law 
                                              an adulterer is punished by the 
                                              chief and he is required to pay 
                                              what is called pan kobiga (vagina 
                                              money) which is an adultery fee. 
                                              This is in fact, as Taylor 
                                              discovered, a quasi-criminal 
                                              remedy. The idea of claiming 
                                              monetary compensation from an 
                                              adulterer is foreign to Dagombas. 
                                              Unless the husband is seeking 
                                              divorce as a result of the 
                                              adultery when the dowry would be 
                                              returned, no direct monetary 
                                              compensation is payable.36 His 
                                              lordship also referred to the bihi 
                                              koba wobu, the period which must 
                                              elapse before a husband should 
                                              have sexual intercourse with his 
                                              wife where the latter has had a 
                                              miscarriage or where the child 
                                              dies after birth.37</span></p>

                                              Taylor's monumental decisions that

                                              be matched by many of his peers.

                                              Mr Justice Kobina Taylor, 
                                              throughout his career as a 
                                              professional lawyer, has been in 
                                              close contact with the criminal 
                                              law. It is not surprising that he 
                                              rose through the senior grades, so 
                                              to speak, to the top post of 
                                              Director of Public Prosecutions in 
                                              the Criminal Division of the 
                                              Attorney-General’s Department. 
                                              That experience and his 
                                              jurisprudence have helped him to 
                                              recognise the potency of the 
                                              coercive machinery of the state 
                                              exemplified in the army, the 
                                              police force and other security 
                                              agencies and the judiciary itself. 
                                              He has the recognition that such a 
                                              formidable machinery ought to be 
                                              used cautiously lest it becomes an 
                                              instrument of oppression and 
                                              violation of fundamental human 
                                              rights. What it would seem 
                                              constitutes the basic 
                                              philosophical premises of Mr 
                                              Justice Taylor’s perception of the

                                              is not like a game of draughts. It 
                                              is rather comparable to a battle 
                                              between the accused and the state 
                                              in which the state with its almost 
                                              unlimited resources behind it, 
                                              enjoys an advantage that no 
                                              accused can ever hope to match. 
                                              For this reason&nbsp; we in the 
                                              traditional courts have been 
                                              obliged for over a century to 
                                              strain hard to uphold a balance 
                                              that will ensure that the accused 
                                              has justice and the state 
                                              apparatus is not used oppressively

                                              The evidence suggests that a 
                                              number of persons were allegedly

                                              been tried in absentia. The 
                                              plaintiff was listed as one of 
                                              twenty-five persons who were 
                                              sentenced to 25 years'

                                              It should be pointed out that none 
                                              of the three persons, Segbefia, J 
                                              J Rawlings or Mfojoh had any 
                                              personal knowledge of the facts 
                                              alleged as constituting the 
                                              judicial action or the purported 
                                              judicial action taken. Segbefia 
                                              never claimed that he saw the file 
                                              from which the charges were read. 
                                              He could not even recollect what 
                                              the charges were nor the 
                                              provisions under which the 
                                              plaintiff was charged. He said 
                                              there was a recording but he never 
                                              read any of the statements on the 
                                              record. Though the recording could 
                                              have been sent to the AFRC, it was 
                                              never produced. As far as J J 
                                              Rawlings' evidence was concerned 
                                              it was merely hypothetical. He 
                                              said if the accused person's name 
                                              was included in the list to be 
                                              confirmed, then he was tried. This 
                                              means he had no personal knowledge 
                                              of the trial either. He placed his 
                                              faith on the one who made the 
                                              list. But there could be an error 
                                              or a deliberate inclusion of his 
                                              name by a villain. The production 
                                              of the press release and the 
                                              warrant of commitment to prison do 
                                              not necessarily, in our opinion, 
                                              constitute a sufficient evidence 
                                              of a trial, let alone a purported 
                                              trial.</span></p>

                                              Yet surprisingly, the Supreme 
                                              Court, with a majority of 5-2 with 
                                              Taylor and Anin JJSC dissenting, 
                                              premised their decision on the 
                                              literal definition of the word 
                                              &quot;purported&quot; and held that a 
                                              judicial action taken within the 
                                              true intendment of section 15(2) 
                                              of the transitional provisions of 
                                              the Constitution, 1979, meant a 
                                              judicial action regularly and 
                                              lawfully taken, ie a judicial 
                                              action which satisfied the 
                                              requirements of the law both 
                                              substantive and procedural, while 
                                              by a &quot;judicial action purported to 
                                              have been taken&quot; was meant an 
                                              action which was not a judicial 
                                              action properly so-called but 
                                              which looked like, was intended to 
                                              be, or which had the outward 
                                              appearance of a judicial action. 
                                              Therefore a purported judicial 
                                              action was one whose claim to 
                                              regularity both procedurally and 
                                              substantively, was inaccurate but 
                                              whose intention to be a judicial 
                                              action was clear. Therefore on the 
                                              facts of the instant case, 
                                              although the evidence led by the 
                                              defendant did not establish or 
                                              prove any judicial action by the

                                              established a judicial action 
                                              purported to have been taken by 
                                              the special court, a body 
                                              authorised by the AFRC, against 
                                              the plaintiff.</span></p>

                                              Taylor was &quot;scandalised&quot; by what 
                                              he regarded as an unjust decision 
                                              of the majority. He would not be 
                                              part of it. In Taylor's dissenting 
                                              opinion, the evidence of the 
                                              defendant's own witnesses showed 
                                              that no evidence was led at all in 
                                              proof of any of the charges. Hence 
                                              the tribunal had no evidence at 
                                              all upon which they could ever 
                                              make findings so as to convict and 
                                              sentence the plaintiff. They only 
                                              proceeded to pass sentence without 
                                              a trial. In his opinion, what 
                                              constituted a trial or a purported 
                                              trial could be found in section 5 
                                              of AFRCD 3. That section provides, 
                                              inter alia, in mandatory terms 
                                              that the evidence of the 
                                              prosecution shall be presented to 
                                              the Court and that the Court shall 
                                              receive all relevant evidence on 
                                              oath or affirmation in proof of 
                                              the charges against an accused 
                                              person. It provides, inter alia, 
                                              that the Court shall be guided by 
                                              the rules of natural justice. 
                                              Evidence, Taylor observed was the 
                                              substance of which a trial was 
                                              made of and not a procedure in a 
                                              trial. By breaching the provisions 
                                              of section 5 of AFRCD 3 on the 
                                              need for calling of evidence, 
                                              there could have been no trial or 
                                              a purported trial. He declared:</span></p>

                                              evidence, a tribunal empowered to 
                                              try a case was in effect declining 
                                              to decide and is abandoning 
                                              jurisdiction. Whatever it does 
                                              without evidence is a nullity.&quot;</span></p>

                                              For this reason there was no trial 
                                              or purported trial as the 
                                              provision of section 5 of AFRCD 3 
                                              was blantantly ignored. It is 
                                              remarkable that while his 
                                              colleagues in the Supreme Court 
                                              were content to perceive the case 
                                              simply in terms of a literal 
                                              interpretation and application of 
                                              the meaning of&nbsp; “purported 
                                              judicial action,&quot; Taylor saw the 
                                              issues and their implications far 
                                              beyond the mechanical application 
                                              of the term within the context of 
                                              those provisions. He would seem to 
                                              continually bear in mind the 
                                              effect of the interpretation of

                                              It should be pointed out that the 
                                              crucial issue in this case is that 
                                              the fundamental human right of the 
                                              citizen is at stake here. As Sowah

                                              tribunal violated the procedural 
                                              rule in a manner which went to the 
                                              root of its jurisdiction.&quot; &quot;If 
                                              this was the end of the matter,&quot; 
                                              the learned judge rightly 
                                              observed, &quot;the course open to me 
                                              is clear. The trial, conviction

                                              AFRC was such that it went to the

                                              act done to be a nullity, the 
                                              inevitable conclusion can only be 
                                              that there was no action in

                                              is not a judicial act. It is

                                              executive act. The AFRC did not 
                                              authorise any such body to act. It 
                                              is plainly an illegal act and 
                                              section 15 in no way saves an 
                                              illegal act taken or purported to 
                                              have been taken ... this illegal

                                              there was before us no evidence 
                                              that the special court established

                                              Taylor did recognise that the 
                                              AFRCD (Special Courts) Decree, 
                                              1979 (AFRCD 3) was a respectable 
                                              Decree. That is why it set down in 
                                              comprehensive terms, dignified 
                                              conditions under which an accused 
                                              person was to be tried. It infused 
                                              into the criminal system, adequate 
                                              safeguards to protect persons 
                                              accused under it. To say as the 
                                              majority of the court would seem 
                                              to be saying that those elaborate 
                                              safeguards could capriciously be

                                              deliberately subverting justice.&quot; 
                                              Taylor could not believe that was

                                              For this reason, in Taylor's 
                                              opinion, it was necessary for the 
                                              Attorney-General, in order to 
                                              prove that the AFRC took or 
                                              purported to have taken judicial 
                                              action against the plaintiff, to 
                                              prove that the body which is 
                                              alleged to have sat was the AFRC 
                                              or an appointee of the AFRC or its 
                                              authorised agent. Taylor argued 
                                              that if the court that tried the 
                                              plaintiff claimed to be an AFRC 
                                              Special Court, then it had failed 
                                              to satisfy the provision of 
                                              section 1 of the Decree which 
                                              established such a court. There 
                                              was clear evidence, for instance, 
                                              as Taylor pointed out, that there 
                                              was no judge advocate, the 
                                              presence of which is a mandatory 
                                              statutory condition for the 
                                              composition of such a court. This 
                                              Taylor rightly pointed out, was 
                                              not a defect in composition, &quot;and 
                                              the AFRC (Special Courts) 
                                              (Amendment) Decree, 1979 (AFRCD 
                                              19) which saves defective 
                                              composition,&quot; Taylor declared, &quot;is 
                                              therefore inapplicable.&quot;</span></p>

                                              The logic of this reasoning can 
                                              hardly be faulted. If a court is 
                                              created by statute setting out 
                                              certain conditions precedent for 
                                              its composition, until these 
                                              conditions are met, the court 
                                              would not be constituted. So that, 
                                              for instance, as in the instant 
                                              case, where there was clear 
                                              evidence that there was no judge 
                                              advocate, it would not amount to a 
                                              mere defect in composition. And 
                                              Taylor was right in concluding 
                                              that under those circumstances the 
                                              alleged court was not constituted 
                                              as an AFRC Special Court. Hence it 
                                              could not have taken any action, 
                                              judicial or otherwise or purported 
                                              to have taken any action on behalf 
                                              of the AFRC. So convinced was 
                                              Taylor about the impropriety of 
                                              the majority decision and the 
                                              dangerous precedential

                                              property that he lamented as

                                              production of the record of 
                                              proceedings. This is the first 
                                              trial in the history of this

                                              Justice Taylor could not

                                              inevitable conclusion that a 
                                              &quot;blatant and outrageous injustice 
                                              of immense proportions&quot; had been 
                                              perpetrated against the plaintiff. 
                                              He rightly expressed his regret 
                                              and sadness that there could 
                                              possibly exist a rule of law which 
                                              welcomed injustice, and declared 
                                              that the majority decision was 
                                              wrong in law.</span></p>

                                              Taylor would never overlook a 
                                              wrongdoing. He would always spot 
                                              it and castigate it. He severely 
                                              admonished the Attorney-General's 
                                              role in the case. He expressed his 
                                              regret that the latter who 
                                              represented the government that 
                                              had sworn to protect the citizen 
                                              was in effect urging the 
                                              judiciary, the authority which was 
                                              the constitutional defender of the 
                                              rights of the people, to deny any 
                                              remedy to the plaintiff who had 
                                              overwhelmingly shown that his 
                                              legal and constitutional rights 
                                              had been violated. Taylor thought 
                                              that the joinder of forces by the 
                                              judiciary and the executive to 
                                              deny justice to a citizen exuded 
                                              an &quot;odious and intolerable smell 
                                              of the totalitarianism of the 
                                              Akoto and Amadu Baba syndrome of 
                                              the First Republic.&quot; Taylor did 
                                              not regard such curtailment of the 
                                              citizen's right in the interest of 
                                              state security justifiable because 
                                              the Constitution, 1979, and the 
                                              thrust of traditional legal 
                                              reasoning favoured a decision 
                                              vindicating freedom and justice. 
                                              These he considered to be potent 
                                              allies which should press the 
                                              judges &quot;to ride roughshod over the 
                                              fears and prejudices of the 
                                              unfortunate segment of our 
                                              society,&quot; undoubtedly a 
                                              significant but an unenlightened 
                                              segment, who because of their 
                                              economic woes and the collapse of 
                                              their living standards, would make 
                                              scapegoats of their fellow 
                                              citizens whose misconduct had not 
                                              in any lawful way been exposed for

                                              It must be said in support of 
                                              Taylor's position that there is no

                                              making references, with great 
                                              admiration, to the bold and 
                                              landmark decisions of some of the 
                                              great judges of the common law 
                                              world that blazed the trail such 
                                              as, for example, Chief Justice 
                                              Marshall in Marbury v Madison,42 
                                              Justice Frankfurter in Baker v

                                              Anderson44 and others, such as 
                                              Lords Denning, Mansfield CJ, Esher 
                                              MR and Chief Justice Coke himself, 
                                              praising their valour; but when 
                                              the opportunity is presented for 
                                              them to tread their path, then 
                                              they recoil into their shells. It 
                                              is to the credit of Taylor and a 
                                              mark of greatness that he has 
                                              never been found wanting on such

                                              grave concern of both the 
                                              legislature and the executive; and 
                                              in my view, they must in the

                                              duties, seek to ameliorate this 
                                              injustice by finding a solution to 
                                              this problem since the Supreme 
                                              Court has in effect declined to 
                                              interfere. They must do it because 
                                              any country that countenances 
                                              injustice may achieve some 
                                              temporary respite; but in my 
                                              humble opinion, such respite is 
                                              illusory and the nation is without 
                                              doubt poised on a path that may 
                                              lead to violence.&quot;</span></p>

                                              Mr Justice Taylor has any sympathy 
                                              for wrongdoers as such. He does 
                                              insist that whenever a man is 
                                              found guilty, particularly for 
                                              dishonesty and corruption, he must 
                                              not escape just punishment.&nbsp; This 
                                              view of the jurist is evident in 
                                              the Kwakye case itself. Taylor 
                                              made it clear in his judgment that 
                                              the executive of the AFRC era were 
                                              clearly intent on punishing the 
                                              criminals who had destroyed the 
                                              country.&nbsp; The future security of 
                                              the state in the enjoyment of&nbsp; a 
                                              sound economy demanded that 
                                              persons who had wreaked havoc with 
                                              the economy were not let loose on 
                                              our society.&nbsp; Therefore while 
                                              declaring the alleged trial, 
                                              conviction and sentence of Kwakye 
                                              to be illegal, null and void, he 
                                              declared and directed that if the 
                                              plaintiff were one of the 
                                              detractors, then by virtue of 
                                              section 17 of the transitional

                                              1979, his case would have been 
                                              pending before the special

                                              In such a case the plaintiff 
                                              should be tried before that 
                                              tribunal.</span></p>

                                              Indeed, Taylor found nothing wrong 
                                              with the tribunal, what he 
                                              deplored was the way in which the 
                                              elaborate safeguards provided by 
                                              the state were capriciously 
                                              ignored with impunity.&nbsp; For in

                                              criminals, Taylor points out, the 
                                              courts must balance the security 
                                              of the state as against the 
                                              individual's constitutional rights 
                                              and the courts must in the

                                              demanding and obtaining from two

                                              which confirmed the state of

                                              court had secured on commission. 
                                              The circuit court before which the

                                              him on the evidence produced. On 
                                              appeal to the High Court, the 
                                              appeal was allowed on the grounds 
                                              that the moneys had been paid into 
                                              the appellant's account by mistake 
                                              and that the prosecution had 
                                              failed to call Djaba and Owusu as 
                                              witnesses. The State appealed from 
                                              that decision to the Court of 
                                              Appeal which set aside the

                                              One of the key issues for 
                                              determination in the appeal was 
                                              the admissibility or otherwise of 
                                              the documentary evidence tendered 
                                              by the prosecution.&nbsp; In Taylor's 
                                              opinion, the ratio of the case was 
                                              a simple one. &quot;The case depends 
                                              entirely on the bank statements 
                                              and nothing else.&quot; In his opinion, 
                                              the trial judge was right in his 
                                              ruling that those documents 
                                              tendered were not being accepted

                                              Taylor points out, and in our 
                                              opinion rightly too, that with the 
                                              exception of the bank statement 
                                              and other documents obtained from 
                                              England by the prosecution there 
                                              was no evidence as to the contents 
                                              of these documents. Taylor in his

                                              offence. Objective readers of the 
                                              case would readily agree with 
                                              Taylor's observation that none of 
                                              the fifteen witnesses had any 
                                              personal knowledge at all of the 
                                              contents of the bank statement and 
                                              were therefore not in a better 
                                              position than the court to say 
                                              anything about their contents.&nbsp; 
                                              Taylor pointed out that the 
                                              original giro credits for £10,000 
                                              and £1,000&nbsp; respectively ought to 
                                              be with Owusu and Djaba. Similarly 
                                              the original cheques issued by the 
                                              appellant for £100 each, exhibits

                                              and no explanation was offered by 
                                              the prosecution; and indeed the

                                              possession of the appellant, his

                                              account cannot be controverted. 
                                              The evidence led by the

                                              apparently unknown stranger, and

                                              the basis of the evidence produced 
                                              by the prosecution the conviction 
                                              of the appellant would be 
                                              tantamount to a conviction of a 
                                              man with no mens rea being proved, 
                                              not even on his actus reus but 
                                              solely on another person's actus 
                                              reus. Arguing that the appellant 
                                              was never shown to have committed 
                                              any criminal act in Ghana he 
                                              warned that the implicit parallel 
                                              of the case with the substance of 
                                              the Kwakye case could not be 
                                              glossed over. &quot;Public officers

                                              On the question of the alleged 
                                              receipt of the money by the 
                                              appellant, Taylor raised, suo motu, 
                                              pertinent legal issues which the 
                                              majority opinion did not consider 
                                              at all. The question was whether 
                                              or not money paid into a 
                                              customer's account at a bank can 
                                              be said to have been obtained by 
                                              the customer. Taylor in his usual 
                                              exhaustive manner examined the 
                                              issue by reference to 
                                              authorities.45</span></p>

                                              The conclusion to be reached from 
                                              the examination of the cases shows 
                                              as Taylor found, that in the law 
                                              of banking, money paid into an 
                                              account is received by the bank 
                                              and it becomes at once the 
                                              property of the bank. The bank 
                                              becomes a debtor to the customer. 
                                              This is what it must be, because 
                                              the relationship between a banker 
                                              and its customer is that of a 
                                              debtor and a creditor. It is 
                                              therefore quite erroneous, as 
                                              Taylor rightly concluded, that 
                                              when the money had been paid to 
                                              the appellant's credit at the bank 
                                              in London, he could thereby be 
                                              said to have obtained that money. 
                                              Another issue which it would 
                                              appear the majority opinion did 
                                              not sufficiently address was the 
                                              affidavit evidence which the court 
                                              had secured from London on a 
                                              commission. The majority view was 
                                              that the securing of the affidavit 
                                              of the official of Barclays Bank 
                                              International, London, by the 
                                              trial circuit court was sanctioned 
                                              under sections 124-127 of the 
                                              Criminal Procedure Code, 1960 (Act 
                                              30). But according to Taylor no 
                                              matter how section 124 of Act 30 
                                              was read, it specifically applied 
                                              only to commissions issued by our 
                                              courts to inferior courts in Ghana 
                                              and not to any tribunal or court 
                                              exercising foreign jurisdiction. 
                                              That section he rightly points 
                                              out, in our opinion, &quot;gives power 
                                              to the High Court or circuit court 
                                              to issue commission to a 
                                              magistrate in Ghana&quot; and when 
                                              issued the magistrate was 
                                              mandatorily required to comply 
                                              with the terms of the commission. 
                                              Our High Courts and circuit 
                                              courts, he pointed out, had no 
                                              power to order any magistrate in a 
                                              foreign country to do anything.&nbsp; 
                                              Having regard to the fact that our 
                                              jurisdiction is territorial, it is 
                                              difficult to see how this argument 
                                              could be faulted.</span></p>

                                              The pity of this case, as Taylor 
                                              points out at the beginning of his 
                                              judgment, is that his judgment had 
                                              not been seen by his colleagues 
                                              and he had not seen theirs 
                                              either.46 This is unfortunate. At 
                                              this level of adjudication at the 
                                              court of last resort, where a case 
                                              as important as the present 
                                              involves the liberty of the 
                                              individual, not only would it have 
                                              been illuminating and rewarding 
                                              for written opinions to have been 
                                              exchanged, but in the interest of 
                                              justice and proper development of 
                                              the law, such exchange and 
                                              discussion of views would seem to 
                                              be a must. Whatever would have

                                              is difficult to say.</span></p>
