                                              Early in 1985 another great 
                                              judicial battle was fought over 
                                              the accountability at customary 
                                              law of the head of family. It was 
                                              won by the proponents of the 
                                              “immunity principle,” according to 
                                              which the head was immune from 
                                              actions for accounts. But the 
                                              opposition was not routed, and at 
                                              the end it seemed quite possible 
                                              that in subsequent litigation it 
                                              would rally, deny the conclusive 
                                              force of the judicial decision, 
                                              and fight again. Then later in the 
                                              year the legislature, a 
                                              peace-keeping force which (unlike 
                                              some) has peremptory and 
                                              irresistible authority, intervened 
                                              and concluded the contest by 
                                              abolishing the immunity principle.</span></p>

                                              In Hansen v Ankrah1 the plaintiffs 
                                              were the head of two of the three 
                                              sections of the Mantse Ankrah 
                                              family of Accra. The first 
                                              defendant was the head of the 
                                              entire family.&nbsp; He had received 
                                              two large sums of money on behalf 
                                              of the family. He had failed to 
                                              pay one of these into a designated 
                                              bank account to the credit of the 
                                              family as, the plaintiffs alleged, 
                                              the family meeting had instructed. 
                                              The other he had paid into this 
                                              account, but he had then, the 
                                              plaintiffs claimed, made 
                                              unauthorised disbursements from 
                                              it. The plaintiffs sued for: an 
                                              order that the head account for 
                                              all the sums he had received on 
                                              behalf of the family; an order 
                                              that he pay into the designated 
                                              family bank account such sum as 
                                              the accounts might reveal him to 
                                              have received for the family; and 
                                              a declaration that he was liable 
                                              to be removed from office for 
                                              breach of trust.&nbsp; Before the 
                                              hearing of the suit they applied 
                                              for interlocutory orders. These 
                                              were to require that the sum which 
                                              had not been paid into the family 
                                              bank account be paid in forthwith, 
                                              and to restrain until judgment any 
                                              disposition of family funds or 
                                              other property. The plaintiffs 
                                              claimed that these orders were 
                                              necessary to ensure the 
                                              preservation of the property 
                                              during the pendency of the action. 
                                              The interlocutory application was 
                                              opposed on the basis of a 
                                              preliminary defence objection to 
                                              the action on the ground that the 
                                              first defendant as head of family 
                                              could not be sued for an account 
                                              by the plaintiffs. The High Court 
                                              granted the plaintiffs’ 
                                              application. The Court of Appeal 
                                              unanimously upheld the defence 
                                              submission, set aside the 
                                              interlocutory orders, and, on the 
                                              ground that in consequence of this 
                                              holding the substantive action was 
                                              bound to fail, dismissed the 
                                              action. The Supreme Court 
                                              dismissed an appeal by the 
                                              plaintiffs, by a bare majority of 
                                              three (Sowah JSC and Francois and 
                                              Mensa Boison JJA) to two (Apaloo 
                                              CJ and Taylor JSC).2 This result 
                                              may not have been conclusive of 
                                              the law. Taylor JSC urged that the 
                                              Supreme Court when differently

                                              feel free to decide the question 
                                              differently, since 
                                              constitutionally the court was 
                                              empowered to depart from a 
                                              previous decision when it appeared 
                                              right to do so.3 This note 
                                              consists of a few comments on the 
                                              decision of the Supreme Court.</span></p>

                                              There were considerable and 
                                              detailed differences between the 
                                              members of the court regarding 
                                              both the effects of the 
                                              authorities and the policies to be 
                                              favoured. But there was a 
                                              consensus on a fairly precise 
                                              definition of the immunity 
                                              principle, the correctness of this 
                                              principle being the legal question 
                                              in issue. The general notion of 
                                              the principle as concerning the 
                                              accountability of the head of 
                                              family needs to be defined in five 
                                              respects.</span></p>

                                              Firstly, the issue concerned the 
                                              particular mode of accountability 
                                              by court order.</span></p>

                                              Even the judgments of the 
                                              majority, propounding the immunity 
                                              principle, accepted that a head of 
                                              family might be under a duty to 
                                              render accounts at a family 
                                              meeting. Thus Sowah JSC said: “In 
                                              our view, there is no question 
                                              that a head of family is 
                                              accountable to the family at a 
                                              family meeting for his 
                                              stewardship.”4 It was implied that 
                                              this undoubted duty was 
                                              enforceable by the further rule 
                                              that a head of family who failed 
                                              to perform the duties of the 
                                              position could be removed from 
                                              office by the family.5</span></p>

                                              Secondly, the issue did not 
                                              concern the liability generally of 
                                              the head to be sued by family 
                                              members. The minority showed, and 
                                              the majority did not question the 
                                              contention that, for example, the 
                                              head could be sued for a 
                                              declaration that a specified 
                                              property was family property and 
                                              not the head’s individual 
                                              property. The issue concerned the 
                                              liability to be sued for an 
                                              account.</span></p>

                                              Thirdly, the issue was not whether 
                                              a person who was a head of family 
                                              was in all circumstances immune to 
                                              an action to account. Strong 
                                              authority holds that a person who 
                                              is a head of family is so liable 
                                              in respect of property which he or 
                                              she holds on behalf of a person or 
                                              group other than the family of 
                                              which he or she is the head. For 
                                              example, property vested 
                                              exclusively in a certain family or 
                                              group may be placed in the custody 
                                              of the head of a wider lineage of 
                                              which the owning family or group 
                                              is a segment. The head of family 
                                              who is entrusted with such 
                                              property is not the head of the 
                                              owning family, nor even a member 
                                              of it, and has no discretion to 
                                              allocate to himself any benefit 
                                              thereof. Hence particular 
                                              restrictions and liabilities may 
                                              be imposed on him, including a 
                                              liability to be sued for an 
                                              account by those beneficially 
                                              entitled.6 Similarly a head of 
                                              family may be liable to be sued 
                                              for an account if the head or 
                                              family have bound themselves 
                                              contractually to pay a specific 
                                              proportion of family funds to any 
                                              person, such as the child of a 
                                              deceased male member of a 
                                              matrilineal family.7 While 
                                              authorities on these situations 
                                              were cited in the present case, it 
                                              is submitted that they were 
                                              relevant only as analogies. The 
                                              issue was limited to the possible 
                                              immunity of the head in respect of 
                                              property vested in that family of 
                                              which he or she was the head, and 
                                              apart from any liability under any 
                                              social contractual obligations.</span></p>

                                              Fourthly, the issue concerned an 
                                              action by principal members of the 
                                              family. It was generally accepted 
                                              that other members, ie junior 
                                              members, were not empowered to 
                                              sue. Thus Taylor JSC, while 
                                              arguing against the immunity 
                                              principle, stated that it would 
                                              not normally be open to junior 
                                              members to bring an action. On the 
                                              other hand, it appears that the 
                                              majority, in accepting the 
                                              immunity principle, would not have 
                                              restricted it to cases, such as 
                                              the present, where only a majority 
                                              of principal members sued. They 
                                              would have applied it also to bar 
                                              an action brought by the unanimous 
                                              consent of all the principal 
                                              members. This may be concluded 
                                              from the nature of the reasoning 
                                              which prevailed. For example, 
                                              Francois JA (as he then was) 
                                              stated approvingly: “Sarbah’s 
                                              statement of the customary law, 
                                              rules out entirely any legal suit 
                                              against a head for account while 
                                              in office.”</span></p>

                                              Fifthly, the issue concerned an

                                              indicated that they would not have 
                                              done so had they not been 
                                              satisfied that serious attempts 
                                              had first been made to settle the 
                                              dispute and secure a statement of 
                                              accounts within the family. Among 
                                              the majority, Francois JA 
                                              suggested that the immunity 
                                              principle would not extend to bar 
                                              an action if it was necessary to 
                                              preserve family property and 
                                              attempts to act within the family 
                                              had been obstructed; although the 
                                              other two members of the majority 
                                              gave no indication that they would 
                                              permit an action at any stage 
                                              prior to the removal of the head 
                                              from office. After deposition the 
                                              action is possible, it is 
                                              universally agreed, but of course 
                                              at this time it is no longer an 
                                              action against a head of family.</span></p>

                                              Thus the issue of the immunity 
                                              principle on which the Supreme 
                                              Court was divided, strictly 
                                              defined, was whether the head of 
                                              family was immune to a suit 
                                              brought by all or a majority of 
                                              the principal members of the 
                                              family for an order to present in

                                              respect of property vested in that

                                              failed. The arguments on this

                                              First, there was extensive and 
                                              detailed argument over the effect 
                                              of the authorities. Disagreement 
                                              was expressed as to which view was 
                                              supported by a preponderant weight 
                                              of authority, either for the 
                                              customary laws of particular 
                                              ethnic groups, or for Ghanaian 
                                              customary laws generally.8 It is 
                                              not possible to summarise here the 
                                              differing analysis of the many 
                                              cases and texts. The judgments 
                                              need to be read by any one wishing 
                                              to make a full appraisal of the 
                                              authorities.9 However, even if the 
                                              authorities had been unanimously 
                                              on one side, they could not have 
                                              absolutely bound the Supreme Court 
                                              to decide the issue in one way. 
                                              Statute provides: &quot;The Supreme 
                                              Court shall not be bound to follow 
                                              the decisions of any other

                                              Secondly, therefore, there was 
                                              argument as to the policies which 
                                              were appropriate for the judiciary 
                                              to follow in establishing the law. 
                                              All members of the majority 
                                              attached weight to the policy of 
                                              maintaining the authority of the 
                                              head of family on account of the 
                                              many socially important functions 
                                              of the head as representative of 
                                              the family. Thus Sowah JSC argued:</span></p>

                                              symbolises the hopes and

                                              routine orders and disorders of 
                                              the daily life of the family.”</span></p>

                                              Related to this was the policy of 
                                              ceding to the family a degree of 
                                              autonomy and self-government. 
                                              Francois JA applauded the

                                              Francois JA, who found near 
                                              unanimity in past authority for 
                                              the immunity principle, emphasised 
                                              the policy of maintaining

                                              The dissenting members of the 
                                              court advanced policy arguments 
                                              for rejecting the immunity rule. 
                                              Apaloo CJ, unlike Taylor JSC, 
                                              seems to have concluded that the 
                                              past authorities gave some support 
                                              to the rule. But they both argued 
                                              that the policy of maintaining 
                                              continuity in the law should carry 
                                              less weight than other policies 
                                              which supported the head’s 
                                              liability. Thus Apaloo CJ held: 
                                              “Refusing to follow an obviously 
                                              unjust precedent cannot rightly be 
                                              construed as judicial 
                                              legislation.” Noting that the 
                                              authorities from some ethnic 
                                              groups supported a principle of 
                                              liability to account, the minority 
                                              judgments adverted to the policy 
                                              of ensuring uniformity in the 
                                              various customary laws, implying 
                                              that this might require the 
                                              overruling of some which indorsed 
                                              the immunity principle.13 They 
                                              attached weight also to the policy 
                                              that no wrong, including a breach 
                                              of trust by a fiduciary, should be 
                                              without a judicial remedy; and to 
                                              the policy of infusing probity and 
                                              accountability into public and 
                                              private life.14</span></p>

                                              This Comment will not advance yet 
                                              another theory of the content and 
                                              rationale of the law on this 
                                              issue. But a suggestion may be put 
                                              as to the nature of the judicial 
                                              function in this case. Much 
                                              discussion, both practical and 
                                              academic, has assumed that the 
                                              function of the courts in the 
                                              determination of questions of 
                                              customary law consists of the 
                                              discovery, recognition and 
                                              application of the practised 
                                              customary law. Any divergence 
                                              between “practised customary law” 
                                              and “judicial customary law”15 is 
                                              avoidable and to be avoided. It is 
                                              suggested that this assumption is 
                                              based upon a fundamental 
                                              misconception of the process. 
                                              Customary rules which structure 
                                              social life outside the courts 
                                              cannot, by their very nature, be 
                                              “recognised” and “applied” by 
                                              courts without change, because 
                                              they are not rules for the 
                                              guidance of the courts. Thus in 
                                              the present instance the social 
                                              practices outside the courts 
                                              constituting the relations between 
                                              a head of family and the principal 
                                              members could not possibly, 
                                              because they existed only outside 
                                              the courts, include rules 
                                              determining the remedies to be 
                                              given by the court. At the most, 
                                              evidence of social practice, for 
                                              those communities in which 
                                              customary adjudicative tribunals 
                                              existed, might have shown whether 
                                              and in what circumstances such a 
                                              tribunal used its particular 
                                              powers and procedures to compel a 
                                              head to present a form of account. 
                                              But those tribunals, their 
                                              procedures and remedies were far 
                                              from identical with the state 
                                              courts and their peculiar powers, 
                                              procedures and remedies. It 
                                              follows that a state court, in 
                                              deciding an issue of customary law 
                                              such as whether it may issue an 
                                              order for accounts to a head of 
                                              family, necessarily creates a new 
                                              rule16a</span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
                                              <span style="font-family: Arial">
                                              It does not follow from this view 
                                              that the court has an unfettered 
                                              discretion to create any rule it 
                                              pleases. It is generally accepted 
                                              in the legal profession that the 
                                              customary law should be designed 
                                              to promote consistently a certain 
                                              body of accepted policies. Thus a 
                                              court engaged in the creation of a 
                                              rule may obtain firm guidance from 
                                              settled rules on related issues. 
                                              An examination of these will often 
                                              clarify the nature of the accepted 
                                              policies pursued in that area of 
                                              law. This was acknowledged in the 
                                              present case. The judgments 
                                              advocated various policies, but 
                                              all sought to show that those 
                                              policies were acceptable by 
                                              reference to authorities. Thus the 
                                              judgments mentioned established 
                                              rules on some of the issues which 
                                              were outside the scope of the 
                                              particular question in the case, 
                                              but concerned the liability of the 
                                              head of family in other respects. 
                                              The judgments which cited them 
                                              recognised that those authorities 
                                              were not directly applicable. The 
                                              implied argument was that the rule 
                                              to be formulated for the present 
                                              case should accord with 
                                              established underlying legal 
                                              principles, so that the law would 
                                              promote consistently the same 
                                              policies.</span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
                                              <span style="font-family: Arial">
                                              For example, the judgments noted 
                                              that by existing authority it was 
                                              clearly possible for accounts to 
                                              be ordered in some cases governed 
                                              by customary law. The implication 
                                              was that, if this had never 
                                              occurred, consistency would have 
                                              required at least that weight 
                                              should be given to the argument 
                                              that the remedy was excluded 
                                              altogether from customary law 
                                              cases. However, since the remedy 
                                              was sometimes available, the 
                                              policy of consistency required an 
                                              examination of the degree of 
                                              similarity between the present 
                                              issue and those of past decisions. 
                                              Thus, since there was authority on 
                                              the liability of a chief to be 
                                              sued for an account of stool 
                                              funds,16b it was thought relevant 
                                              to debate both the precise effect 
                                              of the authority and the closeness 
                                              of the analogy between a chief and 
                                              a head of family.17 So again the 
                                              need for general consistency of 
                                              principle was the basis of 
                                              argument when Apaloo CJ and Taylor 
                                              JSC contended, and Francois and 
                                              Mensa Boison JJA disputed that 
                                              weighty authority held the head to 
                                              be a fiduciary or even a trustee, 
                                              and that fiduciaries were 
                                              generally liable to be sued for 
                                              accounts. When arguments based on 
                                              such specific and relatively 
                                              similar issues emerged as 
                                              inconclusive, then the judgments 
                                              referred to broader and less 
                                              precise principles such as those 
                                              relating to accountability in 
                                              public life. But still the object 
                                              was to ensure consistency between 
                                              the new rule and existing law, not 
                                              to promote the judges' personal 
                                              policy preferences.</span></p>

                                              to be laid down eluded the court. 
                                              There seems to have been

                                              customary law at the present state 
                                              of their historical development. 
                                              There has been a transition from 
                                              an economic order in which the 
                                              lineage was the principal unit of 
                                              production and consumption to an 
                                              order in which the individual can 
                                              secure a monetary income by 
                                              individual effort, and the unit of 
                                              consumption is increasingly the 
                                              conjugal family. Consequently, a 
                                              lower proportion of property is 
                                              today held by families. This trend 
                                              is reflected in rules of customary 
                                              law developed by the courts. Thus 
                                              the presumption in favour of 
                                              family property is now relatively 
                                              weak, and newly acquired property 
                                              is more likely to be vested in the 
                                              individual or individuals who have 
                                              purchased it, and less likely to 
                                              be vested in their families.18 
                                              However, it is not certain how the 
                                              rules on accountability of the 
                                              head can best be constructed 
                                              consistently with policies related 
                                              to this trend. It can be argued 
                                              that, family property being less 
                                              significant today, no serious harm 
                                              will be done if the head is not 
                                              compelled to account for its use; 
                                              and that the cohesion of the 
                                              family will be better maintained 
                                              in the face of disintegrating 
                                              tendencies if the courts refrain 
                                              from intervention in internal 
                                              family matters. The latter 
                                              argument featured prominently in 
                                              the judgment of Francois JA. On 
                                              the other hand it can he argued 
                                              that there is a greater 
                                              probability today that a head will 
                                              have divided loyalties and will be 
                                              tempted to misuse family property 
                                              for the benefit of himself 
                                              personally, his conjugal family, 
                                              or a few individual family 
                                              members; and that family and 
                                              general social cohesion will be 
                                              maintained only by strict control 
                                              of the administration of family 
                                              property to ensure that all 
                                              benefit. The latter argument was 
                                              emphasised in the judgment of 
                                              Taylor JSC.</span></p>

                                              Later in 1985 the legislature 
                                              declared its own decision as to 
                                              the rule which current social 
                                              conditions required. The Head of 
                                              Family (Accountability) Law, 1985 
                                              (PNDCL 114) effectively reverses 
                                              the decision of the Supreme Court. 
                                              Section 2 provides that a family 
                                              member “may apply by motion to a 
                                              Court for an order compelling the 
                                              Head of family to render account .

                                              provides that “a Court shall have 
                                              jurisdiction to make an order 
                                              compelling the Head of family to

                                              The right to apply for an order is 
                                              limited by the condition that the 
                                              court be satisfied that the 
                                              applicant “had taken steps to 
                                              settle the matter within the 
                                              family and that all such attempts 
                                              had failed.” This condition was 
                                              attached by the minority of the 
                                              Supreme Court in Hansen v. Ankrah 
                                              to the rule they advocated of 
                                              liability to actions for accounts. 
                                              However, in another respect the 
                                              law imposes a wider liability than 
                                              had been contemplated even by the 
                                              minority. The application may be 
                                              brought by &quot;any member of the

                                              the property.” These words appear 
                                              to be comprehend every member of 
                                              the lineage in which the 
                                              beneficial enjoyment of the 
                                              property is vested, including 
                                              junior members.20 The law is not a 
                                              reaction to the Supreme Court 
                                              decision. A draft had been 
                                              published more than a year before, 
                                              and two judgments referred to 
                                              this, although not for crucial 
                                              purposes.21 The enacted version 
                                              differed from the draft in several 
                                              respects, but these all seem to 
                                              have been minor verbal matters.</span></p>

                                              One consequence of the law is that 
                                              the decision in Hansen v Ankrah is 
                                              no longer authority. It could be 
                                              argued that the case therefore 
                                              needs no attention, being at most 
                                              of historical interest. However, 
                                              history may provide lessons of 
                                              relevance to contemporary action. 
                                              From this case much may be 
                                              discovered about the judicial 
                                              function and the underlying 
                                              principles of the customary law of 
                                              the family.</span></p>

                                              decision does indeed appear to be 
                                              unprecedented. However, counsel 
                                              from time to time accept that a 
                                              decision on an interlocutory 
                                              application will necessarily 
                                              determine the sunstantive issue, 
                                              and so the parties agree to accept 
                                              the decision on that application 
                                              as decisive of the dispute. The 
                                              main action is then discontinued 
                                              or settled after the hearing.

                                              an additional problem in the

                                              The judgment in that case contains 
                                              some difficult dicta holding, 
                                              inter alia, that the head of 
                                              family might be equated to a 
                                              trustee, and that the equitable 
                                              and customary law principles on 
                                              the accountability of a head were 
                                              not in conflict. It seems 
                                              reasonable to interpret these as 
                                              meaning that customary law 
                                              includes rules on trusteeship and 
                                              accountability which are 
                                              equivalent in substance to those 
                                              of equity, although the procedures

                                              Boison JA was directed at 
                                              countering arguments which had 
                                              been advanced against the immunity

                                              presumption of the correctness of 
                                              the principle, primarily it would

                                              21. Sowah JSC noted with approval 
                                              that the law would require a head 
                                              to be “taken to task for his 
                                              default” in the forum of the 
                                              family before the permitted action 
                                              could be brought. Francois JA 
                                              referred to it to argue against 
                                              judicial abolition of the immunity 
                                              principle, saying that “where a 
                                              new law on the subject is already 
                                              on the draftman's desk, the courts 
                                              have no business to pre-empt the 
                                              law-maker.”</span></p>
