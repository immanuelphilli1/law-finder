                                              Whatever view of punishment we 
                                              hold, whether we think of it 
                                              primarily as the expurgation of a 
                                              stain incurred by a past act or as 
                                              only a means of the prevention of 
                                              social evils, whether we think 
                                              that its essence and only 
                                              justification is retribution, or 
                                              whether we refuse to allow any 
                                              argument for it that could be 
                                              accepted by the strictest 
                                              utilitrian, we still must in any 
                                              case admit that it may subserve 
                                              many purposes, and may have many 
                                              different consequences which are 
                                              advantageous to society. Even 
                                              though there may also be 
                                              corresponding drawbacks, a 
                                              reasonable system of punishment 
                                              certainly does further some good, 
                                              thus leading to some future gain. 
                                              In this paper, we are considering 
                                              the advantages which may be 
                                              attained by punishment, the ends 
                                              for which punishment may be used 
                                              as a means. Whether punishment is 
                                              good as an end in itself or not, 
                                              it is, if wisely inflicted, at any 
                                              rate good as a means to some end 
                                              other than itself. There is no 
                                              difficulty about something being 
                                              valuable both as an end in itself 
                                              and as a means to the realisation 
                                              of other ends; and we are now to 
                                              discuss the value of punishment as 
                                              means.</span></p>

                                              What are the advantages attainable 
                                              by punishment, the reasons for 
                                              which punishment appears socially 
                                              necessary or expedient? These 
                                              advantages or motives have been 
                                              roughly classified as deterrence, 
                                              expiation, restitution, 
                                              retribution, reformation, 
                                              prevention—some are punitive while 
                                              some are not. But we may take it 
                                              that punishment is needed for the 
                                              self-defence of society against 
                                              crime, just as physical force may 
                                              be needed for the self-defence of 
                                              the individual or the state when 
                                              assailed from outside. The 
                                              existence of society, or at any 
                                              rate of the state, depends on 
                                              laws, and a law that is not 
                                              enforced by punishment, if 
                                              necessary, will not be regarded as 
                                              a law in the present state of 
                                              moral development. A &quot;moral law,&quot; 
                                              indeed, does not depend on 
                                              punishment for its binding force, 
                                              it is binding simply because we 
                                              ought to obey it, but a law in the 
                                              political sense is neither the 
                                              same as a moral law (although its 
                                              content may be the same), nor is 
                                              it merely an expression of the 
                                              opinion of the governing body 
                                              about a moral law, it is something 
                                              &quot;enforced&quot; and the enforcing of it 
                                              involves a penalty for those who 
                                              do not obey it. We can, indeed, 
                                              imagine an ideal society in which 
                                              laws would never have to be 
                                              enforced by punishment but would 
                                              always be obeyed without 
                                              punishment, but in an imperfect 
                                              society where some people are 
                                              likely to disobey laws, law 
                                              implies coercion, and coercion 
                                              implies some form of punishment.</span></p>

                                              To make coercion effective we must 
                                              not only use physical force in the 
                                              literal sense, but also the 
                                              psychological resources at our 
                                              command. We must work on offenders 
                                              or possible offenders by 
                                              implanting in them a new motive 
                                              that will work against the motives 
                                              prompting them to crime, and this 
                                              is done by punishment, or rather 
                                              the threat of punishment. 
                                              Punishment is not coercion in the 
                                              literal sense, but it coerces in 
                                              the sense that it forces man to 
                                              choose between acting as the state 
                                              desires and suffering an 
                                              alternative which is intended 
                                              altogether to outweigh any loss 
                                              the individual may incur by 
                                              obeying the state's desires. 
                                              Recently King Fahd of Saudi Arabia 
                                              warned that people who attempt to

                                              punished according to Islamic law.</span></p>

                                              As legal obligations imply 
                                              penalties, so do legal rights, 
                                              since legal rights must be 
                                              protected against violation. As 
                                              Green says, the right to free life 
                                              on the part of associated men 
                                              implies the right on their part to 
                                              prevent such actions as interfere 
                                              with the possibility of free 
                                              action contributory to social 
                                              good. This constitutes the right 
                                              of punishment, the right so far to 
                                              use force upon a person as may be 
                                              necessary to save others from his 
                                              interference. Punishment is a 
                                              necessary incident in the carrying 
                                              out of a law, for it would not be 
                                              a law if its violation were 
                                              passively tolerated. &nbsp;The root of 
                                              punishment is thus the necessity 
                                              for self-defence. Let us now go 
                                              through its specialised functions.</span></p>

                                              Of the preventive function of 
                                              punishment I need say little. It 
                                              is too obvious to need elucidation 
                                              that certain types of punishment, 
                                              especially imprisonment, prevent a 
                                              man from committing crimes during 
                                              a given period in which he is 
                                              undergoing the punishment. The 
                                              direct preventive effect of 
                                              punishment is, however, limited in 
                                              time (except in the case of 
                                              life-long imprisonment and death), 
                                              and has the drawback that it 
                                              prevents the offender from doing 
                                              good as well as from doing evil.</span></p>

                                              By the deterrent effect of 
                                              punishment is meant its effect on 
                                              others other than the man punished 
                                              in making them abstain from 
                                              wrongful acts simply for fear of 
                                              the penalty. For this end to be 
                                              achieved it is necessary, in the 
                                              first place, that punishment 
                                              should be at least likely to 
                                              follow the crime. However severe 
                                              punishments were, their deterrent 
                                              effect would be comparatively 
                                              slight if the offender had, say a 
                                              10:1 chance of escaping 
                                              conviction, and, in general if it 
                                              is to deter effectively, 
                                              punishment must be increased in 
                                              proportion to the chance of 
                                              escape. Secondly, it is not 
                                              sufficient that punishment should 
                                              just counter-balance the gain 
                                              secured by the crime, for in that 
                                              case it would be to the criminal's 
                                              apparent material advantage to 
                                              commit crimes, because if not 
                                              caught he would gain, and even if 
                                              he were caught he would be no 
                                              worse off than he was before. It 
                                              would not, for instance, be 
                                              sufficient deterrence to make a 
                                              thief restore what he had taken 
                                              and give him no other punishment 
                                              beyond that. The penalty, in order 
                                              to fulfil the requirement of 
                                              deterrence, must, therefore, 
                                              exceed the gain of the crime, and 
                                              exceed it in so palpable a fashion 
                                              as to impress the imagination of 
                                              would-be criminals and make it 
                                              quite clear that if caught they 
                                              would lose far more than they 
                                              gained by the crime, and even then 
                                              they would gain if not caught. 
                                              Since punishment can never be 
                                              quite certain, the offender will 
                                              always be able to turn his 
                                              thoughts to the chance of escaping 
                                              scot-free and dwell on that. 
                                              People are notoriously ready to 
                                              think of the chance favourable to 
                                              themselves and ignore the opposite 
                                              possibility, and this would be 
                                              especially so with the 
                                              adventurous, irresponsible and 
                                              desire-controlled types which to a 
                                              large extent make up the criminal 
                                              class. So in fixing punishment for 
                                              deterrent reasons we should have 
                                              to take into account not merely 
                                              the real probability of escape, 
                                              but the probability as it is 
                                              likely to be felt by the offender. 
                                              Hence the punishment should deter 
                                              the culprit and deter others 
                                              inclined to crime, thus 
                                              encouraging a healthy respect for 
                                              the law.</span></p>

                                              There is another alleged good 
                                              gained by punishment, namely, the 
                                              feeling of pleasure experienced by 
                                              individuals at the thought that 
                                              the criminal has been brought to 
                                              justice, and especially by the 
                                              victim of the crime. This view 
                                              must not be confused with the 
                                              ordinary retributive view, because 
                                              it maintains not that punishment 
                                              is an end in itself, but that it 
                                              is valuable as a means to the 
                                              realisation of another end, 
                                              namely, vindictive pleasure. The 
                                              yells of the audience at the 
                                              tribunals when judgment is passed 
                                              prove this assertion.</span></p>

                                              The essence of the expiatory view 
                                              is that in suffering his 
                                              punishment, the offender has 
                                              purged his guilt; he &quot;paid for&quot; 
                                              his crime, and that his account 
                                              with society is therefore clear. 
                                              This is the attitude, for example, 
                                              which lies behind the commonly 
                                              expressed reluctance to hold a 
                                              man's record against him after his 
                                              discharge from prison. To pursue 
                                              him further would be vindictive.</span></p>

                                              With restitution, the rights of 
                                              the victim come into the picture. 
                                              In this view, the criminal should 
                                              make good the damage or the loss 
                                              he has inflicted upon his victim. 
                                              As comparative social anthropology 
                                              shows, compensation or revenge was 
                                              originally exacted by the victim 
                                              himself or his kin, but as 
                                              punishment became more and more a 
                                              public matter, so did the offence 
                                              take on more the character of the 
                                              offence against the community. The 
                                              victim, as he cannot be 
                                              recompensed, is to be revenged. 
                                              Like Shylock, he is entitled to 
                                              his pound of flesh. Margory Fry 
                                              suggests that if the culprit is 
                                              incapable of making proper 
                                              restitution to his victim, the 
                                              state should do so in his stead. 
                                              The state has, afterall, assumed 
                                              the responsibility of maintaining 
                                              public order, and having failed to 
                                              protect the citizen from the 
                                              criminal, should see that he 
                                              suffers no avoidable hardship as a 
                                              result. Nevertheless, the victim 
                                              ought to be compensated by the 
                                              offender if possible, and it is 
                                              both fairer to the latter and more 
                                              economical to treat the payment of 
                                              compensation as part of the 
                                              punishment. Some non-pecuniary 
                                              punishments might also be made 
                                              compensatory. It would be 
                                              possible, for instance, to punish 
                                              a man by making him work for the 
                                              benefit of his victim.</span></p>

                                              The motive of retribution is often 
                                              confused with expiation, with 
                                              which it certainly has much in 
                                              common. Like expiation, 
                                              retribution is concerned with 
                                              restoring the moral balance 
                                              disturbed by the criminal’s 
                                              behaviour. However, it has no 
                                              concern with the moral purgation 
                                              of the criminal himself. 
                                              Retribution is punishment in its 
                                              pristine form. No other motive is 
                                              involved than that of inflicting 
                                              pain or loss on the offender as 
                                              his just need. Among contemporary 
                                              jurists, Goodhart argues that 
                                              &quot;retribution in punishment is an 
                                              expression of the community's 
                                              disapproval of crime, and if this 
                                              retribution is not given 
                                              recognition then the disapproval 
                                              may also disappear. A community 
                                              which is too ready to forgive the 
                                              wrongdoer may end up by condoning 
                                              crime.&quot; Even our religious 
                                              teachers, the leaders of the 
                                              church who teach forgiveness as 
                                              the cardinal virtue, lend it their 
                                              support.</span></p>

                                              involving them in a variety of

                                              We have certain unique skills in 
                                              correctional work. Important among 
                                              these is that social workers are 
                                              trained to see clients as part of 
                                              a total social system that 
                                              contributes to both the problem 
                                              and the solution. Social workers 
                                              thus emphasise contacts with 
                                              employers, teachers, family 
                                              members in order to identify 
                                              problems and seek solutions. We 
                                              have always emphasised case 
                                              co-ordination. This is 
                                              particularly important in the 
                                              correctional field, where multiple 
                                              disciplines are brought together 
                                              and clients are usually 
                                              multi-problem individuals 
                                              requiring a multiplicity of 
                                              services. Social workers' skills 
                                              in using community resources and 
                                              making appropriate referrals are 
                                              also valuable in corrections, as 
                                              are our treatment techniques, 
                                              which uniquely qualify us to work 
                                              with the variety of clients 
                                              involved in the correctional

                                              are all useful in working with 
                                              correctional clients. As change 
                                              agents, social workers play a 
                                              keyrole in assisting the 
                                              correctional clients to identify 
                                              the need to change. This requires 
                                              establishing a helping and 
                                              meaningful relationship with the 
                                              client and making some form of 
                                              diagnosis. Although it is not 
                                              possible to diagnose clearly the 
                                              cause of any individual's criminal 
                                              behaviour, the social worker can 
                                              help inmates identify their 
                                              maladaptive behaviours and needs.
