                                              Public accountability is a 
                                              universal concept, but the 
                                              problems that arise in the course 
                                              of its application in particular 
                                              jurisdictions do stamp it with 
                                              unique characteristics.&nbsp; In the 
                                              treatment of this subject we wish 
                                              to stress that our contribution 
                                              necessarily deals with the concept 
                                              of public accountability as it 
                                              impinges on phases of Ghana's 
                                              constitutional history, touching 
                                              pre-colonial times, the colonial 
                                              era and the independence years. 
                                              The independence years cover our 
                                              experiences of spasmodic epochs or 
                                              periods of constitutional rules 
                                              and military regimes. I dare say 
                                              there are experiences which we 
                                              share in common with many of our 
                                              West African brethren.</span></p>

                                              In all the periods of our

                                              pre-colonial days to modern times,

                                              consequential problems posed by 
                                              these norms and cultural values is 
                                              the burden of our contribution.&nbsp; 
                                              Public accountability as a concept 
                                              is a principle which embraces the 
                                              examination of the conduct of 
                                              individuals, institutions and

                                              have not been in accordance with 
                                              the law.&nbsp; The purpose of the 
                                              examination is to subject 
                                              improper2 and indeed unlawful

                                              neutralise the further undesirable

                                              necessarily involves 
                                              accountability in public life and 
                                              under the law and consequently the 
                                              judiciary as the acknowledged 
                                              mouth-piece of the state with the 
                                              traditional responsibility in an 
                                              appropriate case of pronouncing on 
                                              the legality of the conduct of 
                                              every member of the society, is 
                                              the umpire and a key figure in the 
                                              concept of public accountability.&nbsp; 
                                              The judiciary is encouraged and

                                              procedural machinery devised for 
                                              the purpose.5</span></p>

                                              It is of some importance to note

                                              looking at the problem of the 
                                              ordering of society by means of 
                                              law. It raises questions which are 
                                              synonymous with the perennial 
                                              problem of the rule of law as 
                                              every state in the world sees it.&nbsp; 
                                              The ideal, I suppose, is attained 
                                              if every member of society no 
                                              matter his status in the political 
                                              or constitutional set up in the 
                                              country is publicly accountable in 
                                              all his actions on the premise of 
                                              complying with a priori criteria 
                                              specifically provided to 
                                              superintend all actions under the 
                                              law. As an ideal concept it 
                                              eschews anarchy and extols peace, 
                                              harmony, law and order.</span></p>

                                              This was a period in the 
                                              constitutional history of our 
                                              people, when the individual or 
                                              group able to organise or wield 
                                              naked force, controlled the lives 
                                              of men within the jurisdictional 
                                              area where the sword of the said 
                                              individual or group held sway.&nbsp; 
                                              The wielders of the sword were 
                                              publicly accountable to none but 
                                              themselves. Our ancestors in those 
                                              far off days were pawns in a 
                                              political configuration and 
                                              permutation which they hardly 
                                              grasped. Our past is not unique, 
                                              for almost every country has 
                                              passed through this phase.&nbsp; 
                                              History, it is said, repeats 
                                              itself; and the history and events 
                                              of the past three decades in Ghana 
                                              have such frightful resemblance to 
                                              our pre-colonial past as is 
                                              revealed by the writings of 
                                              Reindorf in his History of the 
                                              Gold Coast and Asante that we must 
                                              respect it; indeed the 
                                              pre-colonial period was truly an 
                                              era in the political and social 
                                              evolution of our people when as a

                                              dictated their conduct were 
                                              determined in the said period of 
                                              our forefathers by subtle and

                                              do not lend themselves easily to 
                                              any precise and accurate

                                              because the factual foundations 
                                              for their exposition has been 
                                              blurred and lost to us in the dim

                                              One significant feature of the 
                                              colonial era is the purposeful 
                                              thrust of the concept of public 
                                              accountability. It became a

                                              and it was fashioned and 
                                              calculated to advance the

                                              seems this theory is nothing but a 
                                              prescription for revolutions. The 
                                              second theory is the supremacy of 
                                              the Constitution confining all

                                              expounded by Chief Justice

                                              representing the cornerstone of

                                              dichotomy in the Ghanaian legal 
                                              order was fostered by incessant 
                                              imposition of military regimes on 
                                              the body-politic necessitating

                                              the criminal law.&nbsp; It is clearly

                                              constitutional theory which is

                                              seems to have sprung from the

                                              testimony that this is quite a 
                                              serious practical problem. At all 
                                              times when people have adopted a 
                                              constitution, they would seem to 
                                              prefer to limit legislative 
                                              sovereignty by constitutional 
                                              provisions. The judiciary however 
                                              does not seem to be structured

                                              challenge and legally react to the 
                                              novelty posed by such revolutions. 
                                              The pity of it all is that the

                                              such military coups are moulded

                                              cast dark shadows on the potential 
                                              capacity of the judiciary to

                                              justice as we have inherited it in 
                                              Ghana,27 the law is no respecter

                                              it, &quot;the idea of legal equality&quot;

                                              in his words that: &quot;every official

                                              It is, however, in our opinion not 
                                              very realistic at least in Ghana 
                                              to equate the &quot;ordinary citizens&quot; 
                                              responsibilities for their actions

                                              the executive for actions they 
                                              take in their executive capacities 
                                              as Dicey would seem to have 
                                              unwittingly done. Our experience 
                                              in Ghana in the years following 
                                              independence does falsify that 
                                              equation because the executive in 
                                              our country is in a really very 
                                              strong position in the 
                                              governmental power structure. 
                                              Dicey's rapturous pronouncement 
                                              therefore does not seem to apply 
                                              to our constitutional experiments 
                                              from independence to the present 
                                              time; it failed to draw the 
                                              necessary distinction between 
                                              public accountability of executive 
                                              acts under the law as our courts 
                                              have applied it since independence 
                                              and the public accountability of 
                                              the ordinary citizen during the 
                                              same period.&nbsp; With humorous 
                                              cynicism the average Ghanaian sees 
                                              the alleged executive equality as 
                                              more equal than the citizens.&nbsp; It 
                                              is the type of equality that

                                              51) officials acting in their 
                                              official capacities would seem to 
                                              be at times capable of avoiding

                                              Minister of the Interior issued 
                                              deportation orders against Wahabi 
                                              Balogun and three other men and

                                              On hearing counsel, the court 
                                              directed that notice of the motion

                                              persons, before the notices were 
                                              served on him on 31 October 1958.</span></p>

                                              This is quite consistent with the 
                                              English case of Bowles v Bank of 
                                              England58 where the English court 
                                              held that a resolution of one 
                                              House of Parliament could not 
                                              amount to law, because one House 
                                              acting alone did not constitute 
                                              the Parliament recognised by the 
                                              English courts. Thus in our own 
                                              local case of Mekkaoui v Minister

                                              Kwakye v Attorney-General61 where 
                                              a contrary conclusion was arrived 
                                              at by the Supreme Court on the 
                                              peculiar provision of&nbsp; the 
                                              transitional provision of the 
                                              Constitution, 1979 ousting the 
                                              jurisdiction of the court.62&nbsp; It 
                                              is often said that the judiciary 
                                              is the least powerful estate in 
                                              the realm. The legislature 
                                              controls the finances of the 
                                              Republic and the executive has the 
                                              coercive forces of the state at 
                                              its disposal. The court has 
                                              neither the purse nor the sword 
                                              and for this reason, the 
                                              conclusion, a non sequitur, is 
                                              drawn that it is the weakest in 
                                              the governmental power 
                                              structure.63&nbsp; I venture to think 
                                              that this view is a misconception.</span></p>
