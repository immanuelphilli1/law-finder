                                              simpliciter. The petitioning wife,

                                              in 1953.&nbsp; There were four children 
                                              of the marriage.&nbsp; In 1980 she 
                                              filed a petition for the

                                              together with a prayer for 
                                              financial provision.&nbsp; The petition 
                                              for divorce was uncontested and in 
                                              January 1981 she was granted a 
                                              decree of divorce by the High 
                                              Court.&nbsp; In March 1981, she 
                                              instituted proceedings for

                                              wife.&nbsp; In its view the disposition 
                                              of &quot;Haulage House&quot; to the second 
                                              wife was a hoax, in the sense that 
                                              even after the transfer the 
                                              appellant continued to have legal 
                                              dominion over it by receiving rent 
                                              income for his own use.&nbsp; The court 
                                              in its reasoning found much 
                                              support from a long line of 
                                              English authorities dating back to 
                                              the sixteenth century.6</span></p>

                                              Secondly, on the issue of the 
                                              manner in which the trial judge 
                                              exercised his discretion to award 
                                              financial provision, the Court of 
                                              Appeal rejected the appellant's 
                                              contention that financial 
                                              provision should be awarded on the 
                                              basis of the financial 
                                              contribution made by a spouse 
                                              towards the acquisition of the 
                                              property in question.&nbsp; In the view 
                                              of the court, the issue was not 
                                              whether or not a party to a 
                                              marriage made a substantial 
                                              financial contribution; it was 
                                              simply whether she was entitled to 
                                              be provided with a decent 
                                              accommodation as part of financial 
                                              provision. As the court explained, 
                                              &quot;it was a matter which included 
                                              the living standard of the 
                                              parties, their financial 
                                              circumstances and conduct before 
                                              and after the marriage.&quot; The court 
                                              added that the applicant-wife 
                                              devoted all her energy and life to 
                                              serve the appellant, looked after 
                                              the home and cared for the 
                                              children of the marriage and those 
                                              born outside wedlock during the 
                                              cohabitation period of 34 years.&nbsp; 
                                              There was ample evidence of the 
                                              appellant's properties which 
                                              included ten houses, one in the 
                                              United Kingdom, stocks and shares 
                                              and a printing press as compared 
                                              with nothing owned by his wife.&nbsp; 
                                              In view of all this, observed the 
                                              court, &quot;was it too much to ask the 
                                              appellant to accommodate such a 
                                              devoted wife-petitioner in just 
                                              one of the several houses . . .

                                              arguments relating to the powers

                                              citing the New Zealand case of 
                                              Hofman v Hofman,13 his lordship 
                                              went to great lengths to show that 
                                              &quot;unless specifically legislated 
                                              for, no court would consider loose 
                                              discretionary powers as conferring 
                                              a right to re-distribute a 
                                              spouse's property.&quot;&nbsp; Turning to 
                                              the instant case, his lordship 
                                              felt that it was clear &quot;that both 
                                              the law and the facts do not 
                                              confer any proprietary rights in 
                                              the wife of any legitimate claims 
                                              over her husband's properties.&quot;&nbsp; 
                                              Her request for one of her 
                                              husband's houses, he stated could 
                                              only in the context legitimately 
                                              refer to a request for adequate 
                                              &quot;financial provision.&quot;&nbsp; The thrust 
                                              of his lordship's judgment was 
                                              that the powers entrusted to the 
                                              court to award financial provision 
                                              in the event of divorce or nullity 
                                              of a marriage were limited to the 
                                              powers of making monetary award be 
                                              it a lump sum payment or 
                                              otherwise, for as he reasoned, 
                                              nowhere does Act 367 confer on the 
                                              court a power of selection in 
                                              order to identify and earmark a 
                                              particular house to meet a 
                                              spouse's prayer for financial 
                                              provision when such a spouse has 
                                              no &quot;title or an interest in that 
                                              property.&quot; ln his view, therefore, 
                                              both the High Court and the Court 
                                              of Appeal erred in the exercise of 
                                              their discretion. Firstly, on the 
                                              ground that no such legislation as 
                                              the English statutes culminating 
                                              in the Matrimonial Causes Act, 
                                              197314 exists here; yet it was 
                                              acknowledged by him that Ghana 
                                              inherited its matrimonial laws 
                                              from Britain and was bound by the 
                                              English matrimonial laws till 
                                              recently.&nbsp; Secondly, Mr Justice 
                                              François observed that &quot;Haulage 
                                              House&quot; was not a matrimonial home, 
                                              hence he did not see the 
                                              legitimacy behind the order of 
                                              rescission.&nbsp; His lordship said 
                                              that the courts below erred in 
                                              assuming that upon the breakdown 
                                              of a marriage the entire estate of 
                                              either party to a marriage came 
                                              under their scrutiny and 
                                              suzerainty.&nbsp; He questioned the 
                                              finding of the courts below that 
                                              there was evidence that the 
                                              appellant-husband disposed of 
                                              &quot;Haulage House&quot; with the intention 
                                              of defeating the course of 
                                              justice, adding that the line of 
                                              English authorities relied on was 
                                              inapposite since the appellant 
                                              never intended to render himself a 
                                              bankrupt.&nbsp; His lordship finally 
                                              said that in the instant case, &quot;a 
                                              lump sum award as indicated by 
                                              Lord Denning in Wachtel v 
                                              Wachtel15 would have been a 
                                              compelling solution in a situation 
                                              of this kind where the husband was 
                                              demonstrably 'affluent'.&quot;</span></p>

                                              The split decision of the Supreme

                                              1971 was enacted by Parliament on

                                              marriage after it &quot;has considered 
                                              the standard of living of the 
                                              parties and their circumstances.&quot;&nbsp; 
                                              It is, however, section 20 which 
                                              affords the courts the machinery 
                                              to that end.&nbsp; The expression 
                                              &quot;financial provision&quot; is defined 
                                              in section 43 to include 
                                              &quot;Maintenance and all other forms 
                                              of financial support to be 
                                              provided by one spouse to the 
                                              other or to any child of the 
                                              household.&quot;</span></p>

                                              There is no doubt that the duty 
                                              imposed on the court to exercise 
                                              its powers under section 19 
                                              &quot;whenever it thinks just and 
                                              equitable&quot; was to accord to it the 
                                              widest possible discretionary 
                                              powers to re-adjust the financial 
                                              position of the parties.&nbsp; The 
                                              scope of sections 19 and 20 was 
                                              intended to bring about a shift of 
                                              emphasis like the English statute, 
                                              from the old concept of 
                                              &quot;maintenance&quot; of the wife and 
                                              children by the husband to one of 
                                              re-distribution of assets and, 
                                              what might be called &quot;purchasing 
                                              power&quot;25; so that in dealing with 
                                              the spouses' assets the court no 
                                              longer asks: &quot;Whose is this&quot; but 
                                              rather &quot;To whom shall this be 
                                              given.&quot;26&nbsp; This approach is a 
                                              complete innovation.27 The shift 
                                              of emphasis had to be made with 
                                              the backing of legislation, 
                                              because it could not be done by 
                                              the evolutionary method of case 
                                              law as the speeches show in

                                              It must surely have contributed to 
                                              the split decision of the Supreme 
                                              Court.&nbsp; Judicial wisdom, however, 
                                              has warned against the dangers of 
                                              loose discretionary powers in a

                                              that the absence of guidance on

                                              power may be worse than any 
                                              conflict of precepts.&nbsp; In another 
                                              case, absolute discretion has been 
                                              called a ruthless master, more 
                                              destructive of freedom than any of 
                                              man's other inventions.29&nbsp; In a

                                              discretionary power, like &quot;public 
                                              policy,&quot; has been described as an

                                              However, in exercising that 
                                              discretion, the court would have 
                                              to be guided by law; the 
                                              discretion meant sound discretion 
                                              guided by law not vague, arbitrary

                                              of law.52 Lord Denning MR observed 
                                              in Wachtel v Wachtel53 that in 
                                              spite of criticism&quot;. . . it has 
                                              retained its attraction for a very 
                                              simple reason: those who have to 
                                              assess maintenance must have some 
                                              starting point.&nbsp; They cannot 
                                              operate in a void.&nbsp; No better 
                                              starting point has yet been 
                                              suggested than the one-third 
                                              rule.&quot;</span></p>

                                              The power of the court to order a 
                                              lump sum payment came into force 
                                              in Ghana in 1963.56&nbsp; It is unlike 
                                              periodical payment order which can 
                                              be rescinded or varied from time

                                              settlement has been executed, the 
                                              court shall not have the power to 
                                              review or vary the order 
                                              subsequently in the event of the

                                              explained in Ribeiro by Adade JSC

                                              under which it can be ordered are 
                                              various, in Wachtel v. Wachtel58 
                                              Lord Denning was able to restate a 
                                              few of the principles as follows:
                                              </span></p>
                                              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
                                              <span style="font-family: Arial">
                                              &quot;One thing is, however, obvious.&nbsp; 
                                              No order should be made for a lump 
                                              sum unless the husband has capital 
                                              assets out of which to pay it Ú 
                                              without crippling his earning 
                                              power. Another thing is this: when 
                                              the husband has available capital 
                                              assets sufficient for the purpose, 
                                              the court should not hesitate to 
                                              order a lump sum.&nbsp; The wife will 
                                              then be able to invest it and use 
                                              the income to live on. This will 
                                              reduce any periodical payments; or 
                                              make them unnecessary.&nbsp; It will 
                                              also help to remove the bitterness 
                                              which is so often attendant on 
                                              periodical payments.&nbsp; Once made, 
                                              the parties can regard the book as 
                                              closed.&nbsp; The third thing is that, 
                                              if a lump sum is awarded, it 
                                              should be made outright.&quot;</span></p>

                                              and it is not reduced because a 
                                              wife is likely to re-marry.&nbsp; But 
                                              it is not without its drawbacks

                                              recipient.&nbsp; For example it is an

                                              cannot be varied when 
                                              circumstances change.&nbsp; The payee 
                                              cannot go back to the court and 
                                              ask for more.&quot;</span></p>

                                              to order the transfer of the 
                                              property of either party to the

                                              From its wording and context, the

                                              section 21 should have to be 
                                              guided by legal principles which

                                              &quot;The procedure was devised as a 
                                              means of resolving a dispute or a 
                                              question as to title rather than 
                                              as a means of giving some title 
                                              not previously existing.&nbsp; One of 
                                              the main purposes of the Act of

                                              for the property rights of the

                                              entirely separate. There was no 
                                              suggestion that the status of 
                                              marriage was to result in any

                                              enabling the court to pass 
                                              property rights from one spouse to

                                              title to property the question for 
                                              the court was—'Whose is this' and 
                                              not—'To whom shall this be 
                                              given'.&quot; </span></p>

                                              This was the line of approach 
                                              adopted in the dissenting speeches 
                                              of François and Wuaku JJSC in 
                                              Ribeiro.&nbsp; It has to be remembered 
                                              that the wife-petitioner in that 
                                              case did not make a claim of title 
                                              to any property.&nbsp; She asked for 
                                              financial provision and 
                                              accommodation.&nbsp; So the court did 
                                              not have to ask itself the 
                                              question &quot;Whose is it&quot; but rather 
                                              &quot;To whom shall this be given.&quot;</span></p>

                                              Under section 26(1) of Act 367 the 
                                              court has power to restrain either

                                              the power of the court on any 
                                              asset of either spouse.&nbsp; 
                                              Consequently, it can make any

                                              obvious that any attempt by a

                                              power of the court would be 
                                              rightly interpreted as a step 
                                              intended to usurp the power of the

                                              that a husband had procured the 
                                              execution of mortgage to a bank in 
                                              order to defeat a financial claim 
                                              by the wife, he observed that the 
                                              bank knew of that design and was 
                                              therefore not entitled to 
                                              possession.&nbsp; It is submitted that 
                                              the majority judgment of the

                                              controversy would have been 
                                              avoided if an application for the

                                              The scope of the powers given to 
                                              the court under Act 367 to award

                                              of a breakdown of a marriage is 
                                              wide and far-reaching.&nbsp; The 
                                              supporting provisions were enacted 
                                              to ensure an equitable

                                              partners in marriage in much the 
                                              same way as the freedom of 
                                              testamentary disposition has been 
                                              cut down by section 13 of the 
                                              Wills Act, 1971 (Act 360) and the

                                              111).&nbsp; It is now regarded as a 
                                              question of a fundamental human 
                                              right; this is why the 1979 
                                              Republican Constitution ordered 
                                              that &quot;No spouse may be deprived of

                                              estate be testate or 
                                              intestate.&quot;67&nbsp; The matrimonial

                                              achieved by means of further

                                              is a matter which calls for
