  "caseTitle": "OKANTEY VERSUS KWADDEY.",
  "summary": "In Okantey v. Kwaddhey, the plaintiff claimed title to a plot of stool land in Osu, Accra, based on a 1939 customary grant, but the land had already been conveyed to the Government in September 1939 under a deed that included a clause for possible re-conveyance if no longer needed. The plaintiff argued he acquired a contingent reversionary interest under that clause. However, the court held that such a future interest violated the rule against perpetuities because vesting was not guaranteed within 21 years of a life in being. Furthermore, the Accra Town (Lands) Ordinance, effective October 1940, vested the land absolutely and indefeasibly in the government, extinguishing any residual interest. Since no divestment order had been issued before the plaintiff filed suit in March 1956, he held no enforceable interest. The defendant, though possibly holding defective title, was in possession and not counterclaiming, so the plaintiff’s claim failed. Judgment was entered for the defendant.",

    "The plaintiff could not succeed based on weakness in the defendant's title; he had to prove his own valid claim, which he failed to do.",
    "No divestment under s. 2(2) of the Ordinance had occurred before the action was filed, so no interest could pass to the plaintiff."
