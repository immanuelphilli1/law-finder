  "caseTitle": "AND OTHERS VERSUS N'JIE AND ANOTHER.",
  "summary": "In this 1956 Gambian Supreme Court case, the plaintiffs sought revocation of letters of administration granted to Mustapha N'Jie for the estate of Machimban N'Jie, who died in 1910. A will dated 1903, discovered only after the death of the last surviving beneficiary in 1953, bequeathed property to joint tenants, with the survivor acquiring full interest. The court held that despite the delayed production and lack of external evidence, the legal maxim 'omnia praesumuntur rite esse acta' applied, presuming proper execution. The will was deemed valid under English law, even though the testator was a Mohammedan, as it was formally executed in English form. The grant of letters of administration was revoked in favor of the will's beneficiaries.",
