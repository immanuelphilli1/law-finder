  "caseTitle": "YAKUBU SEIDU v . K. ADAMA",
  "summary": "This is a chieftaincy appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana concerning the succession to the Wa skin following the death of Wa Na Boudiri Momori II in 1998. The petitioner, Yakubu Seidu, a prince from the Nakpaha gate and holder of the Guli-Na title, claimed he was validly elected by the kingmakers at an election held on 20th April 1998. The election involved seven kingmakers representing four divisional gates (Yijihi, Najeri, Jonyuobi, Nakpaha), the Froko, Tendaana, and Yeri Na. The petitioner alleged that he received votes from the Tendaana, Yeri Na, Froko, and his own Nakpaha gate, making him the majority choice. However, the second respondent, B.K. Adama (later substituted by Alhaji Issah Bukari), announced that the Busa Na had been elected and transferred his election to the first respondent, who was then proclaimed as Wa Na. The petitioner challenged this, asserting the Busa Na was not a candidate and the process was invalid. The Judicial Committee of the Upper West Regional House of Chiefs ruled in favor of the petitioner, declaring him duly elected and that it was Nakpaha gate's turn under a rotational system established in 1951. The National House of Chiefs upheld this decision. On appeal to the Supreme Court, the appellant argued misdirection in law, reliance on hearsay, and incorrect application of the rotational system. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' concurrent findings of fact, emphasizing the presumption of correctness in such findings and the absence of compelling reasons to overturn them. It held that the rotational system included all four gates and that Nakpaha's turn had come, thereby validating the petitioner's election and the injunction against the installation of the first respondent.",
