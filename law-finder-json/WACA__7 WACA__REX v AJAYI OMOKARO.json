  "caseTitle": "R. v. Sykes",
  "summary": "The appellant, Ajayi Omokaro, was convicted of murder based entirely on his confessions, one of which was made before a European Assistant Commissioner of Police. On appeal, the sole issue was whether a conviction could stand on such a basis. The West Africa Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, citing R. v. Sykes as authority that a conviction solely on confessional evidence is valid if the confessions are proven genuine. The trial judge had carefully examined the circumstances and found the confessions authentic. The appeal was dismissed.",
