  "caseTitle": "REX v AGUMAGU NWAOKE .",
  "summary": "The appellant, Agumagu Nwaoku, was convicted of manslaughter for causing the death of his former wife, Nwoacha, after invoking a 'juju' called 'Onye Uku' and threatening her when she refused to repay marriage money. The trial judge held that the juju created a well-grounded apprehension of inevitable harm in the native mind, analogizing it to cases where fear causes immediate life-endangering acts. However, the West Africa Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, finding no evidence that the specific juju had ever led to suicide or that the accused knew it was reasonably likely to cause her to take her own life. The court emphasized that the deceased's suicide, occurring six days later and requiring significant deliberation, was not an immediate or inevitable consequence of the threat. The court distinguished this from cases where fear directly causes impulsive acts (e.g., jumping from a window). Without proof of reasonable likelihood or direct causation, section 310 of the Criminal Code did not apply. The conviction and sentence were quashed.",
