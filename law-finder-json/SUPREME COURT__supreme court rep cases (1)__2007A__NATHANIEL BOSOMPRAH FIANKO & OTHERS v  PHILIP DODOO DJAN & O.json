  "caseTitle": "NATHANIEL BOSOMPRAH FIANKO & OTHERS v PHILIP DODOO DJAN & O",
  "summary": "In this civil appeal before the Ghanaian Supreme Court, the appellants challenged the lower courts' determination that the co-respondent, Daniel Tawiah Akotuah Addo, was the beneficial owner of property H/No. B 565/6, Abossey Okai, Accra, despite a registered title deed (Exhibit B) and other documents being in the name of their late father, Nathaniel Fianko Akotuah. The lower courts consistently found that the co-respondent provided the purchase money and had collected rents without challenge, establishing beneficial ownership. The appellants argued errors in the application of estoppel, conclusive presumptions under Sections 25 and 26 of the Evidence Decree, and misappreciation of documentary evidence. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, affirming that concurrent findings of fact by lower courts are not disturbed absent a clear blunder or miscarriage of justice. It held that estoppel did not apply as the co-respondent was not a party to the deed, and equitable principles allow the true purchaser to prove beneficial ownership despite legal title being in another's name. The Court found no misapplication of law or evidence warranting interference.",
