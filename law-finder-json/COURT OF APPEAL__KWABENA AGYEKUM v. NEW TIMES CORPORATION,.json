  "caseTitle": "KWABENA AGYEKUM v. NEW TIMES CORPORATION, CIVIL APPEAL",
  "summary": "Kwabena Agyekum, a former supervisor at New Times Corporation, was dismissed in 1978 following his arrest by a state action unit. He filed a civil action in 1985 seeking reinstatement, damages for wrongful dismissal, specific performance for end-of-service benefits, return of his seized vehicle (AG 1195), and release of alleged illegal profits from the car's sale. The trial court dismissed his claims, and he appealed to the Court of Appeal. The appellate court held that the claims for wrongful dismissal, trespass, and related reliefs were statute-barred under NRCD 54 (Limitation Decree 1972), as more than six years had elapsed between the cause of action and the filing of the suit. The court found no evidence of fraud or concealment to justify the delay. The equitable claims for specific performance regarding end-of-service benefits, return of the vehicle, and illegal profits were also dismissed, as damages would be an adequate remedy and the plaintiff had unreasonably delayed. The appeal was accordingly dismissed.",
