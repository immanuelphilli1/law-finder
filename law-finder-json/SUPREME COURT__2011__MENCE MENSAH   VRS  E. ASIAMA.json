  "summary": "This is a civil land dispute appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana, Mence Mensah v E. Asiama (J4/14/2007, 20th July 2011). The appellant claimed title to land based on a 1959 grant from the Oshilanaa quarter of Labadi, while the respondent traced his title to a 1957 auction sale to E.A. Quarcoo under a court order in John Adeoje v C.S. Commey, evidenced by a certificate of purchase. The High Court and Court of Appeal both found for the respondent, holding that C.S. Commey had lost ownership prior to 1959 and thus could not validly convey title. The Supreme Court upheld these concurrent findings, emphasizing that it would not disturb factual conclusions absent clear error. The appellant challenged the authenticity of the certificate of purchase, alleging forgery due to lack of suit number and signature by a magistrate instead of a High Court judge. The Court rejected this, ruling that forgery must be pleaded and proven beyond reasonable doubt under Order 19 r.16 and Section 13(1) of N.R.C.D. 323, and that failure to raise the issue at trial or in cross-examination precluded appellate consideration. Searches from the national archives were disregarded as improperly introduced fresh evidence. The appeal was dismissed.",
