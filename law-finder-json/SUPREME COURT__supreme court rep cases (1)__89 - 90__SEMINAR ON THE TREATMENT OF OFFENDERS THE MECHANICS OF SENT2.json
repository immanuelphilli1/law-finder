  "caseTitle": "SEMINAR ON THE TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS THE MECHANICS OF SENT2",
  "summary": "This 1989-90 seminar paper analyzes the mechanics of sentencing in Ghana, focusing on the role of public tribunals established under PNDCL 24 and later PNDCL 78. It outlines three dominant theories of punishment—retributive, deterrent/preventive, and reformative—and observes that judicial discretion in sentencing is broad, especially in tribunals. The paper notes that while tribunals were created to democratize justice and respond to rising crime rates—including white-collar crime, drug trafficking, and timber fraud—sentencing practices have largely favored deterrence, resulting in high incarceration rates. Critically, the author highlights prison overcrowding, the ineffectiveness of reform, and the risk of judicial bias, such as sentencing based on personal experiences or guilty pleas. Special provisions for juveniles and alternatives like communal labor are discussed, but the overall policy is seen as overly reliant on custodial sentences, undermining rehabilitation and straining resources.",
