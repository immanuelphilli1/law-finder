  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case, decided on 31st March 2004, involved a property dispute over House No. O.T.77A in Kumasi. The appellant, Madam Akosua Agyentoa, purchased the entire house from Elizabeth Victoria Mensah, who had inherited her brother Daniel Owusu's share after his 1959 intestate death under pre-1985 customary law. The respondents, Daniel Owusu's children, had occupied two rooms rent-free since 1975. The District and High Courts ruled in favor of the appellant, but the Court of Appeal partially reversed, recognizing the children's inheritance rights under PNDC Law 111 (1985). The Supreme Court affirmed that the will created a tenancy in common, and PNDC Law 111, which grants inheritance rights to children, applied retroactively to this pending case. Thus, the respondents were entitled to their father's half-share, making the appellant's ownership limited to the other half. The appeal was dismissed in part and succeeded in part.",
