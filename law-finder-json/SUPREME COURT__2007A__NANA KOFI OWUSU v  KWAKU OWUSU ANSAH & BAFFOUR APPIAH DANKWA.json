  "caseTitle": "NANA KOFI OWUSU v KWAKU OWUSU ANSAH & BAFFOUR APPIAH DANKWA",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision concerns a civil appeal over the grant of an interim injunction in a land dispute between Nana Kofi Owusu (plaintiff/appellant/respondent) and Kwaku Owusu Ansah and Baffour Appiah Dankwa (defendant and co-defendant/appellant). The land, located in Twedie and designated as durbar grounds, was claimed by both parties through their respective traditional authorities: the Toasehene and the Anantahene. The co-defendant, claiming as Odikro of Twedie under the Anantahene, obtained an interim injunction from the High Court to prevent the plaintiff from allocating plots. The Court of Appeal set aside the injunction, finding the plaintiff had a better claim based on historical arbitration awards (1946, 1999) affirming Toasehene's ownership. The Supreme Court upheld the appellate decision, ruling that the trial judge misapprehended facts—particularly the existence of pending litigation—and failed to properly consider the pleadings and affidavits. It emphasized that interim injunctions require a serious question to be tried and that the balance of hardship favored the plaintiff, especially given the public interest in preserving community durbar grounds. The court also noted a revenue-sharing agreement, undermining the co-defendant's claim of financial loss.",
