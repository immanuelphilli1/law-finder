  "caseTitle": "CHIEF JOSEPH WOBO AND NINE ORS v THE ATTORNEY- GENERAL",
  "summary": "In this West African Court of Appeal case, Chief Joseph Wobo and nine others appealed a trial court decision dismissing their claim for a declaration of ownership over land in Port Harcourt and cancellation of two agreements (1913 and 1928) with the colonial government. The appellants argued the agreements were not valid sales, the parties were not ad idem, and the government had abandoned the 1913 agreement due to non-payment of the £2,000 consideration. The court held that the parties were ad idem, evidenced by oaths of proof, interpretation, and receipt of the revised 1928 payment. The 1913 agreement was not abandoned, as the government had taken possession of part of the land, and the 1928 agreement explicitly incorporated and varied the first. The 1928 agreement, providing £7,500 upfront and £500 annually in perpetuity, was not void for uncertainty regarding price or land area (which was defined by a plan and confirmed by a surveyor). The court rejected the argument that this constituted payment by installments leaving the government as tenants at will. The appellants' later petition acknowledging the 1928 agreement and requesting a higher annual payment further confirmed its validity. The appeal was dismissed.",
