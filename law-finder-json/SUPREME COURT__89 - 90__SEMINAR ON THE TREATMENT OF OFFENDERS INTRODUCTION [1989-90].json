  "caseTitle": "SEMINAR ON THE TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS INTRODUCTION [1989-90]",
  "summary": "The 1989-1990 Judicial Service seminar on the Treatment of Offenders in Ghana addressed severe prison overcrowding, prolonged pre-trial detention, poor conditions in police custody, and the high fiscal and human cost of incarceration. Organized by the Judicial Council under the leadership of Chief Justice E.N.P. Sowah, the seminar brought together key stakeholders including judges, police, social workers, and legal experts to examine custodial conditions, alternatives to imprisonment, and human rights standards. The discussions highlighted systemic inefficiencies in case processing and the dehumanizing treatment of suspects, prompting calls for reform in offender treatment and prison decongestion.",
