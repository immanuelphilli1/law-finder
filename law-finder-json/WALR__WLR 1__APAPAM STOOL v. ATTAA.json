  "caseTitle": "STOOL VERSUS ATTAA",
  "summary": "The Apapam Stool appealed a Land Court decision that had reversed a Native Court judgment granting it a declaration of title to land occupied by Attaa, successor to Agya Mfodjo. The Native Court had recognized the stool's ownership and ordered compensation to the defendant for improvements. The Land Court dismissed the claim, citing estoppel due to the stool's 20-year failure to demand tribute (a sheep annually). The West African Court of Appeal held that non-demand for customary tribute did not constitute estoppel, as it did not amount to fraudulent encouragement. It emphasized that customary tenancy allows cultivation and improvements without transferring ownership. The appeal was allowed, the Land Court's judgment set aside, and the Native Court's decision restored.",
