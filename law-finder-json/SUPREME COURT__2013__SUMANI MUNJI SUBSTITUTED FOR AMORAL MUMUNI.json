  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an appeal concerning the High Court's jurisdiction to extend time for filing an appeal three years after the decision. The appellant had filed an appeal in 2003, which was dismissed in 2006 as a nullity. The High Court later granted an extension of time, but this order was vacated by the same court using its review jurisdiction under Order 42 of C.I. 47, on the grounds that the application was filed beyond the six-month statutory limit under Rule 9(7) of C.I. 19. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeal's decision, holding that the original extension order was void for lack of jurisdiction and could be set aside under the court's inherent or review powers, citing Mosi v Bagyina and Network Computers Ltd. v Intelstat Global Sales & Marketing Ltd. as authority.",
