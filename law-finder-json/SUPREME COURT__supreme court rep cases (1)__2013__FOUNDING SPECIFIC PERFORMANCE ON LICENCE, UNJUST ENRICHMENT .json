  "caseTitle": "FOUNDING SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE ON LICENCE, UNJUST ENRICHMENT",
  "summary": "The article critically examines the Ghanaian case Quagraine v. Adams, where the plaintiff, informally adopted by the defendant's mother, was denied specific performance of a promise to convey land despite building a six-bedroom house on it in reliance. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial court’s finding of no enforceable contract but awarded compensation based on doctrines of licence, unjust enrichment, and proprietary estoppel. The author argues that equitable principles, particularly equitable licence supported by consideration, should have justified specific performance. The discussion explores the nature of licences, distinguishing bare, contractual, and irrevocable forms, and references English and Australian jurisprudence to highlight tensions between common law and equity, especially in cases involving payment for access or use of land. The plaintiff’s reliance and substantial expenditure warranted stronger equitable protection than mere damages.",
