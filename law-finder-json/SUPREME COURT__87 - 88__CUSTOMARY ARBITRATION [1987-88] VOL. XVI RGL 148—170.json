  "summary": "This legal commentary examines the doctrine of customary arbitration in Ghana, a traditional method of dispute resolution preserved under Ghanaian law and recognized by the courts since 1883. It outlines the five essential characteristics of valid customary arbitration as established in Budu II v Caesar: (i) voluntary submission of the dispute, (ii) prior agreement to accept the award, (iii) a non-arbitrary decision reached after hearing both sides judicially, (iv) adherence to local Native Court procedures, and (v) publication of the award. The article analyzes key judicial decisions, particularly from the 1950s and 1960s, that shaped the understanding of 'voluntary submission,' resolving earlier conflicts between rulings in Yaw v Amobie and Tanor v Dapomah. The Supreme Court ultimately held in Donkor v Isifu that mere attendance at a meeting does not constitute consent; there must be clear evidence that parties understood and agreed to arbitration. The piece emphasizes that while 'customary arbitration' shares the broad concept of third-party dispute resolution with statutory arbitration, it is distinct in form and procedure, rooted in indigenous practice and not governed by English arbitration law. The commentary also notes the continued legal recognition of customary arbitration under various statutes and constitutions, despite the absence of codification.",
