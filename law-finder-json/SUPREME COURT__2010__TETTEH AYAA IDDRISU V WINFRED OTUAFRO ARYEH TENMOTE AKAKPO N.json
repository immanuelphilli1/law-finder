  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision arose from a civil appeal concerning a land dispute between the plaintiff, Iddrisu Ayaa Tetteh, representing the Ayaa Kwabla family, and defendants Winfred Otuafro Aryeh and Tenmote Akakpo. The case centered on the enforcement of a prior judgment (Suit No. 1/2001) where the trial court had ordered the defendants to pay GH¢2,000 per acre for 200 acres of land and to compensate for additional occupied plots following a survey. The plaintiff, after four years of inaction, filed a new suit seeking an upward review of the ground rent and compensation for extra land at current market value. The Supreme Court held that the plaintiff's failure to execute the original judgment rendered the new claim for rent review an abuse of court process, citing the principle that a party cannot benefit from their own wrong. The Court emphasized that judgments declare pre-existing liabilities and must be enforced through proper execution mechanisms. While the appeal challenged the compensation award of GH¢50 million per acre for additional plots, the Supreme Court upheld it, finding no error in the trial court's exercise of judicial discretion. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the need for finality in litigation.",
