  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC v. THE HIGH COURT, ACCRA EX-PARTE CONTINENTAL C",
  "summary": "The Republic applied for certiorari to quash a High Court judgment in a commercial dispute between two foreign parties, arguing the court lacked jurisdiction. The Supreme Court dismissed the application as out of time, holding that despite claims of jurisdictional nullity, Rule 62 of C.I. 16 mandates filing within 90 days of the impugned decision. The court emphasized that even allegedly void judgments require compliance with statutory procedures to be challenged and that failure to meet the time limit extinguishes the right to relief. The preliminary objection was upheld, affirming procedural rigor over substantive claims of jurisdictional defect.",
