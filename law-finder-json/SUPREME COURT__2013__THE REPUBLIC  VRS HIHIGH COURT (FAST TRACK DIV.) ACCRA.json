  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC VRS HIHIGH COURT (FAST TRACK DIV.) ACCRA",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana addressed whether public funds and government property can be attached in execution of a judgment debt against the State. The case centered on the interpretation of Article 293 of the 1992 Constitution, which allows claims against the Government without requiring a fiat or petition of right, making the State liable in tort and contract similarly to a private person. The applicant argued that while the State could be held liable, courts lacked jurisdiction to attach public funds for enforcement. The Court rejected this, emphasizing that the constitutional framework ensures accountability and equal subjection of the State to the law. It distinguished Ghana’s position from outdated common law doctrines, citing the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 (UK) and jurisprudence from Australia, particularly New South Wales v Bardolph, to affirm that valid contracts with the State are enforceable even without specific parliamentary appropriation, provided they fall within authorized government administration. The ruling upheld the principle that the rule of law requires the State to be answerable to court judgments, reinforcing judicial authority to enforce execution against public funds where appropriate.",
