  "caseTitle": "SEMINAR ON THE TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS TYPES OF PUNISHMENT [1",
  "summary": "This academic paper by Senah K A examines the historical evolution of punishment across societies, from early tribal systems to modern institutions. It highlights how punishment has been shaped by societal beliefs about crime, collective responsibility, and supernatural forces. In early societies, public crimes like taboo violations and witchcraft were punished severely, often by execution or ostracism, to protect the group from spiritual harm. Private crimes triggered blood feuds based on lex talionis. Early modern societies retained brutal methods such as flogging, mutilation, branding, and public humiliation. Over time, imprisonment became the dominant institutionalised punishment, though many penal practices remain inhumane. The paper critiques ongoing harsh conditions in prisons, including in Ghana, and advocates for a shift toward reformative and rehabilitative justice in line with modern humanistic penology.",
