  "caseTitle": "J. J. OCQUAYE",
  "summary": "The West African Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal in J. J. Ocquaye v. L. Quarshie & Ors. (1937) because the appellant failed to pay costs awarded by a Native Tribunal and did not obtain proper leave to appeal. The court held that the Provincial Commissioner's Court lacked authority under section 77(2) of the Native Administration Ordinance to grant leave, and the proviso did not empower the appellate court to intervene. In a separate case, Mensah Nyaku & Ors. v. Otoo Pabi, the court allowed an appeal challenging the joinder of parties and causes of action, ruling that combining a land ownership claim—within the jurisdiction of a Native Tribunal—with claims involving interpretation of English-form legal documents created procedural unfairness. The writ was struck out without prejudice to re-filing in appropriate forums.",
