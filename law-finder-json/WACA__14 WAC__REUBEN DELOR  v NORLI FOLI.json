  "caseTitle": "REUBEN DELOR v NORLI FOLI",
  "summary": "The case Reuben Delor v Norli Foli (1952) arose from a loan agreement where Foli borrowed £360 from Delor, secured by his lorry, and granted Delor the right to seize the lorry upon default. After Foli defaulted, Delor took possession without opposition. Foli sued for trespass and damages, while Delor sought the lorry's documents. The trial court ruled the seizure a trespass and awarded damages to Foli. On appeal, the West Africa Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, holding that a party may lawfully authorise another to seize a chattel for debt under a contractual licence, distinguishing real property mortgages requiring court intervention. The seizure was lawful, and Foli was ordered to transfer the lorry to Delor.",
