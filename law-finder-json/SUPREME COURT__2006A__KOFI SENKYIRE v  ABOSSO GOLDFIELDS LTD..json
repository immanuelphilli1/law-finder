  "caseTitle": "KOFI SENKYIRE v ABOSSO GOLDFIELDS LTD.",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana reviewed an appeal in Kofi Senkyire v. Abosso Goldfields Ltd., concerning the wrongful dismissal of a foreman in the sampling department. The plaintiff was summarily dismissed after being found with gold-bearing rocks at a security gate, which the company alleged was an attempt to steal. A disciplinary committee investigated, found the evidence largely circumstantial and insufficient to prove theft beyond reasonable doubt, yet recommended termination due to perceived malicious intent, while advising payment of entitlements. The Circuit Court initially ruled for the plaintiff, awarding damages for wrongful dismissal, but the Court of Appeal reversed it. The Supreme Court ultimately held that the employer failed to meet the high standard of proof required for dismissal on grounds of gross misconduct, particularly dishonesty, and reinstated the plaintiff's claim. The court emphasized that while trust is paramount in the gold mining industry, termination must be grounded in procedurally sound and evidentially sufficient findings, which were lacking here.",
