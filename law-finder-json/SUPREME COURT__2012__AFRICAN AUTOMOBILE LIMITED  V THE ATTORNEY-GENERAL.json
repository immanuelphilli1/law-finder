  "caseTitle": "AFRICAN AUTOMOBILE LIMITED V THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana upheld the lower courts' decision that no valid contract existed between African Automobile Limited and the Attorney-General (representing the Ministry of Information) regarding credit terms for vehicle servicing. The plaintiff claimed a debt with compound interest based on Exhibits A and B, but the court found Exhibit A—an offer letter—required a specific form of acceptance (signed, dated, stamped copy), which was not met. Exhibit B, purportedly accepting the terms, was undated, unsigned, and not on official letterhead, and thus insufficient to form a binding agreement. The court affirmed that the plaintiff proved the principal debt for services rendered between 1994 and 1998, but without a valid contract, compound interest could not apply. Instead, interest was properly awarded at the prevailing commercial banking rate from April 1999, as authorized by CI 52. The Supreme Court found no error in the Court of Appeal's affirmation of the trial court's judgment, emphasizing that contract formation is a legal determination for the court, not a referee, and that findings of fact supported by evidence cannot be overturned on appeal.",
