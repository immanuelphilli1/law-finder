  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal considered an objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal of the Paramount Chief of Akwapim in a case involving the succession to property of a deceased person domiciled in Akwapim but owning land in Dodowa, outside the chief's territorial jurisdiction. The court held that under Section 43(1)(g) of the Native Administration Ordinance, the tribunal had jurisdiction to determine succession matters where the deceased was domiciled within its state, regardless of the location of the land. The court distinguished this case from prior rulings where the central issue was land ownership. Since the primary issue here was succession under customary law, and expert evidence on Guan succession practices was presented, the objection was overruled.",
