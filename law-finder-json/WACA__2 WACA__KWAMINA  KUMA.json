  "caseTitle": "KWAMINA KUMA",
  "summary": "This 1934 West Africa Court of Appeal decision involved a land dispute between Kwamina Kuma (plaintiff-respondent) and Kofi Kuma (defendant-appellant) over a parcel known as Tenkyirem. The plaintiff sought a declaration of title and an injunction but failed to provide sufficient evidence to meet the burden of proof. The court held that the plaintiff should have been non-suited at trial due to inadequate proof of ownership. The defendant successfully demonstrated continuous, unchallenged occupation of the land for six generations through ancestral lineage from Kweku Andoh, a sub-captain of the Abura tribe. The plaintiff's claims of ownership, including alleged permissions granted to others and interference with a land sale, were deemed unconvincing. The appeal was allowed, the lower court's judgment reversed, and a judgment of non-suit entered in favor of the defendant with costs.",
