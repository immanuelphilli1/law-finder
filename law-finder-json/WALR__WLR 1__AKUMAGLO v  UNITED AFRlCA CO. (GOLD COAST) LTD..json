  "caseTitle": "AKUMAGLO VERSUS UNITED AFR",
  "summary": "In Akumaglo v. United Africa Co. (Gold Coast) Ltd., the plaintiff's lorry was lost when it rolled backwards off a ferry pontoon into the Volta River after the pontoon made contact with the riverbank. The plaintiff alleged negligence, claiming the impact caused the accident. The court found that the evidence showed the jolt was not severe and would have propelled the vehicle forward, not backward. With no evidence of pontoon tilting, brake failure, or other negligence, and no support for res ipsa loquitur, the plaintiff failed to discharge the burden of proof. Judgment was entered for the defendants, as the plaintiff did not establish that the loss was due to the defendant's negligence.",
