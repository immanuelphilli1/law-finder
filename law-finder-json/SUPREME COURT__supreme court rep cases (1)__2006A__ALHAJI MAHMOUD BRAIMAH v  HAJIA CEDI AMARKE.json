  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision from 11th November 2006 concerns a property dispute over house E.47/12 in Nima, Accra, formerly owned by the late Alhaji Mahmoud Mustapha Ali. Upon his death, the property was inherited by his children, both natural and adopted. The property was allegedly sold to the respondent by the deceased's eldest son and two uterine sisters without the knowledge or consent of two adopted brothers, Abubakar Laye and Laye Broke. The court found the sale invalid due to lack of consent from all rightful heirs and failure by the purchaser to conduct due diligence. The principle in Boateng v. Dwinfo (1979) GLR 360 was applied, holding that a prudent purchaser must investigate apparent encumbrances. The appeal by the defendant was dismissed, affirming that the sale could not be upheld in equity.",
