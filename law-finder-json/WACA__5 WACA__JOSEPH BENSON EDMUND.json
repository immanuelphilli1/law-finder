  "caseTitle": "JOSEPH BENSON EDMUND",
  "summary": "This 1939 West African Court of Appeal decision in Joseph Benson Edmund v. G. F. Ferguson and Emmanuel Mensah concerned a declaration of title to land at Royal Lane, Cape Coast. The court held that the property was family property under native law and custom, originally owned by William Duncan and passed to his descendants without individual inheritance rights. The mortgage by Samuel William Ferguson Duncan to George F. Ferguson was invalid due to lack of family consent. The court rejected the lower court's implication of acquiescence, noting the family promptly objected upon discovery through legal representation and filed suit immediately after the mortgage was advertised. The appeal was allowed, the lower judgment set aside, and judgment entered for the plaintiff, affirming family ownership and rejecting the mortgage's validity.",
