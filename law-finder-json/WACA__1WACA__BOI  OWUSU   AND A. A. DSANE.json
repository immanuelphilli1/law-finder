  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF LAND AT NKWANTAMANG REQUIRED FOR THE SERVICE OF THE GOLD COAST COLONY AND IN THE MATTER OF THE PUBLIC LANDS ORDINANCE",
  "summary": "This 1933 West African Court of Appeal case involved a dispute over compensation for land acquired by the Gold Coast government near Nkwantanang. The appellants, C. Boi Owusu and A. A. Dsane, claimed ownership based on four generations of uninterrupted possession by their ancestor Kotei Amli, asserting the land was unoccupied when first settled. The respondent, the Manche of Labadi Stool, argued the land was originally acquired by conquest and formed part of the Labadi Stool lands, with the appellants merely enjoying customary use as subjects. The Court upheld the lower court's decision in favor of the Stool, holding that long user alone does not extinguish Stool title under native custom. Constructive occupation through shifting cultivation was acknowledged, but deemed not adverse to the Stool. Alleged acts of ownership—toll collection and a land grant to the Basel Mission—were rejected as insufficient proof of title. The judgment affirmed that compensation should be received by the Stool, with appellants entitled to a share under customary distribution.",
