  "caseTitle": "PURCHASE BY A HUSBAND IN THE NAME OF HIS WIFE DEVIOUSNESS OR",
  "summary": "In Ramia v. Ramia, the plaintiff purchased land and had it conveyed to his wife, the defendant, and later constructed a building in her name. He sued to have the property transferred to him, claiming a resulting trust. The High Court and Court of Appeal ruled against him, upholding the presumption of advancement in favour of a lawful wife, which was not rebutted by evidence of contrary intention. The courts held that post-conveyance conduct, such as the husband's management of the property, could not be used to establish a resulting trust. The case confirmed the applicability of English common law doctrines in Ghana, including the presumption of advancement in marriages under customary and Moslem law, provided the parties intended common law to govern. However, where customary law governs the marital relationship, common law doctrines like resulting trusts may not apply. The decision emphasized that intention is determined at the time of conveyance and that local practices, such as a husband managing his wife's property, should not automatically imply beneficial ownership.",
