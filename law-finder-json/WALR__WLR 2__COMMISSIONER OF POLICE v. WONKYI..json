  "caseTitle": "COMMISSIONER OF POLICE VERSUS WONKYI.",
  "summary": "The case Commissioner of Police v. Wonkyi (1956) involved an unregistered medical practitioner convicted under the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Ordinance, c. 69, s. 20, for falsely assuming the title of a medical practitioner and receiving payment for medical practice, along with a charge of fraud by false pretence under the Criminal Code, s. 293. The Supreme Court of the Gold Coast quashed the convictions due to duplicity in the charges and the trial magistrate's failure to assess the appellant's mens rea or honest belief in his right to use the title 'Doctor of Naturopathy'. The court emphasized that the offence of assuming a medical title requires wilful and false intent, which must be proven as a question of fact. The acquittal was ordered, but the judgment cautioned against future misuse of medical titles.",
