  "caseTitle": "COMPTROLLER OF CUSTOMS v MICHAEL NTIERO EFFIOM",
  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal addressed four legal questions arising from a customs prosecution in Ghana. It held that the trial judge correctly refused to allow the Comptroller of Customs to amend charges after trial began, as the application amounted to a prohibited substitution of charges. The court also affirmed that amending particulars was improper because they described smuggling rather than the charged offence of possession of prohibited imports. The refusal to convict on an uncharged offence—possession of twelve tierce of tobacco—was upheld, as the proven offence was not part of the original charge. Finally, the court ruled that the trial judge misinterpreted Regulation 6 of the Customs Ordinance Cap. 130 by applying it to territorial waters (Man-of-War Bay), when it only applies to inland waters, rendering the seizure unlawful.",
