  "caseTitle": "JAAS CO. LIMITED VRS EDWARD APAU",
  "summary": "In this civil land dispute, JAAS Co. Limited and Togbe Hornomenu (Appellants) claimed ownership of a parcel of land in North Odorkor, asserting they had purchased it from the 2nd Appellant, who previously won title in Civil Appeal No. 25/80. The Respondents, Edward Apau and Madam Akua Achempomaa, counterclaimed, asserting ownership through purchase from the Asere Stool. The High Court dismissed the Appellants' claims and granted judgment to the Respondents on their counterclaim, a decision upheld by the majority of the Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court affirmed that the Appellants failed to establish title, particularly because the 2nd Appellant disowned Exhibit B (the site plan), which was central to proving the transaction. The Court held that no useful purpose would be served by ordering a retrial, as the Appellants' case collapsed on its own merits. The Respondents had established a prima facie case through valid deeds and evidence of customary consent.",
