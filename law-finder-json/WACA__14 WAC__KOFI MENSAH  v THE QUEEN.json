  "caseTitle": "KOFI MENSAH v THE QUEEN",
  "summary": "Kofi Mensah was convicted of murder for shooting Akua Gyinae, a woman with whom he had been cohabiting and hoped to marry, after she disappointed his marital expectations. He claimed he consumed gin and palm wine, became intoxicated, and had no recollection of the shooting until he found himself beside her, covered in blood. The trial judge dismissed the possibility of a manslaughter verdict and refused to consider intoxication as negating intent, convicting him of murder. On appeal, the West Africa Court of Appeal held that the appellant's conduct did not support a finding of preconceived intent to kill and that the trial judge committed a serious misdirection by failing to consider whether intoxication negated the requisite intent for murder. Citing R. v. Kweku Kotoro and R. v. Kwabena Bio, the court quashed the murder conviction, substituted a conviction for manslaughter, and sentenced the appellant to ten years' imprisonment with hard labour.",
