  "summary": "This book review by Dr. Kwame Frimpong critically examines A. N. E. Amissah's work on the role of courts in government in Ghana and other Commonwealth African countries between 1981–82. The review discusses the evolution of judicial independence from the colonial era through post-independence regimes, focusing on Ghana’s experience under Nkrumah, military rule, and the Busia government. It highlights key cases such as Re Akoto, the Second Treason Trial, Salifu, and Sallah, illustrating the judiciary's struggles with executive overreach. While Amissah acknowledges the formal legality of actions taken by the Nkrumah regime—such as judicial removals and preventive detention—the reviewer critiques this 'legal punctilio' as insufficient justification for authoritarian practices. The review emphasizes that true judicial independence requires more than procedural legality; it demands substantive commitment to individual rights and impartiality. It also questions whether political considerations in judicial appointments can ever guarantee desired outcomes, citing Lord Denning’s view that judges must discard politics upon appointment. Ultimately, the reviewer argues that courts must protect citizens from state abuse, even when such rulings conflict with executive interests, and warns against dismissing constitutional safeguards as mere 'legal technicalities.'",

  "verdict": "The review concludes that while Amissah provides a comprehensive analysis of the judiciary's role, his ambivalence toward the Nkrumah regime's use of legal forms to justify authoritarianism is problematic. True judicial legitimacy lies in protecting individual rights, not merely adhering to formal legality.",
