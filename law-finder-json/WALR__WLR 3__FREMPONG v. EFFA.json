  "caseTitle": "FREMPONG VERSUS EFFA",
  "summary": "In Frempong v. Effa, the High Court addressed a land dispute stemming from a prior action where the Aperade Stool's claim to ownership was dismissed, resulting in a nonsuit in favor of the Tarkwa Stool, later confirmed by the Privy Council. In a subsequent suit, the Tarkwahene (Frempong) sought recovery of possession from Effa, a farmer on the land, and damages for trespass, alleging Effa's failure to attorn tenant. The court held that the prior judgment barred the Aperade Stool and its subjects (including Effa) from asserting ownership due to estoppel per rem judicatum, despite the Tarkwa Stool's failure to counterclaim. It affirmed the customary principle requiring occupants to attorn tenant to the declared owner, and upheld the Native Court's judgment. However, a later appeal to the Ghana Court of Appeal set aside the decision due to insufficient evidence linking the disputed land to the prior judgment, emphasizing the need for production of the relevant plan.",
