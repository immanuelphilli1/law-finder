  "summary": "In FKA Company Ltd v Effah Sarkodie, the Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed the appellant's appeal challenging the lower courts' rulings in favor of the respondent in a land dispute. The plaintiff, FKA Company Ltd, claimed title to approximately 95.194 acres at New Weija-Accra, acquired via customary grant in 1980 by its managing director from the Weija Stool, with formal documentation updated in 1998 when the company was incorporated. The defendant claimed ownership through grants from the Ngleshie Amanfro Stool and later the Weija Stool. The court found that the plaintiff’s prior customary acquisition divested the Weija Stool of any further interest, rendering subsequent grants invalid under the principle of nemo dat quod non habet. Crucially, an independent surveyor confirmed that 85% of the land claimed by the defendant fell within the plaintiff’s cadastral plan. The court also relied on prior unchallenged judgments affirming the plaintiff’s title and a letter of consent to sublet signed by Weija authorities. The defendant’s arguments, including alleged inconsistencies in testimony and the corporate entity distinction under Salomon v Salomon, were rejected. The Supreme Court upheld the findings of the lower courts, affirming that the plaintiff had established title by preponderance of probabilities.",
