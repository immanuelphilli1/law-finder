  "caseTitle": "AMBROSE DOTSE KLAH V PHOENIX INSURANCE CO. CIVIL APP",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision from 2012 concerns the appeal by Ambrose Dotse Klah against the Court of Appeal's reversal of a severance award granted by the High Court. The appellant, formerly Chief Accountant at Phoenix Insurance Company, was summarily dismissed in 2005 and subsequently filed a claim for wrongful dismissal, defamation, and severance benefits totaling GH¢701,128,000. The High Court ruled in his favor, awarding severance and general damages, but the Court of Appeal upheld the wrongful dismissal finding while quashing the severance award due to lack of evidentiary proof. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeal’s decision, holding that despite the claim being pleaded, the appellant failed to discharge the burden of proof under the Evidence Act, 1975 (sections 10 and 11), as no evidence was led to substantiate the severance amount. The court emphasized that pleadings alone cannot substitute for evidence, especially when denied by the opposing party, and that technical adherence to procedural rules is essential for justice according to law.",
