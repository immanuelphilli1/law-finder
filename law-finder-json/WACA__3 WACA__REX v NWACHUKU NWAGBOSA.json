  "caseTitle": "REX v NWACHUKU NWAGBOSA",
  "summary": "This 1937 West Africa Court of Appeal decision involved an application by Nwachuku Nwagbosa, convicted of murder in 1933 and sentenced to death (later commuted to life imprisonment), seeking extension of time and leave to appeal under Section 13(1) of Ordinance No. 47 of 1933. The Crown opposed the application. The Court dismissed the application, following the precedent in Rex v. Twynham, and directed that similar future applications should not be listed without prior judicial review for exclusion. The appellant appeared in person, with Ivor Brace representing the Crown.",
