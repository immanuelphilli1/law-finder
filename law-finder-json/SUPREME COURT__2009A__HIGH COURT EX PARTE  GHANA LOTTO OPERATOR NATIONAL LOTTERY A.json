  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana ruling addresses the validity of a case transfer conducted without a formal written order from the Chief Justice under section 104 of the Courts Act, 1993 (Act 459). The applicant, Ghana Lotto Operators Association, sought to quash proceedings and a ruling by Justice Ofori-Atta in Fast Track 2 High Court, arguing he lacked jurisdiction because no official transfer order existed from Justice Asante, who had previously handled the matter. The court examined the scope of the Chief Justice’s transfer powers, referencing prior cases like Osei v. The Republic (1968) and Akainyah v. The Republic. While one line of authority held that a judge is only 'seised' upon commencement of hearing, the court rejected this, affirming that a judge becomes seised once a case is listed. However, it emphasized that any transfer by telephonic or electronic means must be immediately confirmed in writing per s.104(3), otherwise it is void. As there was no evidence of such authorization or exceptional urgency, the proceedings before Ofori-Atta J were deemed without jurisdiction. The application for certiorari was granted, quashing the impugned rulings due to lack of proper transfer under the law.",
