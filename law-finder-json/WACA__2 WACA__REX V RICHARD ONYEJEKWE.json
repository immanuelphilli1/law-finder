  "caseTitle": "REX V RICHARD ONYEJEKWE",
  "summary": "The appellant, Richard Onyejekwe, was convicted in the High Court of Enugu on two counts: stealing by a clerk or servant under Section 390(6) of the Criminal Code and fraudulent false accounting under Section 438(b). On appeal to the West Africa Court of Appeal, it was held that the High Court improperly revived the stealing charge, which had been dismissed by the Magistrate after preliminary investigation. The appellate court ruled that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to reintroduce a charge not included in the committal order. Regarding the false accounting charge, the court found no evidentiary basis, as the cash balance entry in question accurately reflected the accounting liability between the accused and his employer, Messrs. John Holt & Company, despite a discrepancy in physical cash on hand. The conviction was therefore quashed. Additionally, the restitution order was invalidated due to lack of evidence that the accused possessed the funds and because it effectively imposed a civil debt with criminal penalties. Both convictions and the restitution order were quashed, and the accused was discharged.",
