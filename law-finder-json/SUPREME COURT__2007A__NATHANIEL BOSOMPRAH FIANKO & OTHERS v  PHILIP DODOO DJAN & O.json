  "caseTitle": "NATHANIEL BOSOMPRAH FIANKO & OTHERS v PHILIP DODOO DJAN & O",
  "summary": "In this civil appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana, the appellants challenged the lower courts' determination that the co-respondent, Daniel Tawiah Akotuah Addo, was the beneficial owner of property at H/No. B 565/6, Abossey Okai, Accra, despite a registered title deed (Exhibit 'B') in the name of their late father, Nathaniel Fianko Akotuah. The District Court, High Court, and Court of Appeal had all found in favor of the co-respondent based on evidence that he provided the purchase money and had collected rents without challenge. The Supreme Court upheld these concurrent findings, applying the principle that the person who advances the purchase money holds the beneficial interest in equity, citing Dyer v. Dyer (1788). It rejected the appellants' argument of estoppel under Sections 25 and 26 of the Evidence Decree, noting the co-respondent was not a party to the deed and that equitable truths cannot be barred by estoppel. The Court emphasized that the appellants failed to demonstrate a clear error in the face of crucial evidence or a misapplication of legal principles that would justify overturning the lower courts' factual conclusions.",
