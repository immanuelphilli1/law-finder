  "caseTitle": "COMMISSIONER OF POLICE VERSUS MENSAH.",
  "summary": "In Commissioner of Police v. Mensah, the appellant was convicted of unlawfully possessing goods reasonably suspected of being stolen under section 108 of the Criminal Code. He appealed, arguing that the prosecution's cross-examination about a previous conviction violated section 129(f) of the Criminal Procedure Code, which protects accused persons from questions about bad character unless they open the door. The High Court held that the appellant had waived this protection by (1) asserting a defence of lawful acquisition through honest work, thereby putting his good character in issue, and (2) accusing a police witness of destroying a statement, which constituted an attack on the witness's character. The court further ruled that even if the questioning were improper, no miscarriage of justice occurred given the strength of the evidence and the magistrate's experience. On sentencing, the court rejected the argument that only one prior conviction counted, holding that eight prior convictions for stealing were 'similar offences' to unlawful possession under section 80 of the Criminal Code, as both fall under Title II. Thus, the appellant's twelve-month sentence was upheld, though it was ordered to run from the date of original conviction due to appellate delays.",
