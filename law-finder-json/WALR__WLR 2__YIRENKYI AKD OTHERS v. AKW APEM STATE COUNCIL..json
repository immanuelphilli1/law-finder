  "caseTitle": "AKD OTHERS VERSUS AKW APEM STATE COUNCIL.",
  "summary": "The applicants sought an order of prohibition to prevent the Akwapem State Council from hearing a claim concerning the ownership of land. The court held that the jurisdiction of State Councils under the State Councils (Colony and Southern Togoland) Ordinance, c. 8 of 1952, section 5, is limited to constitutional matters, and a dispute over land ownership does not fall within this scope. The hearing notices clearly indicated that title to land was in issue, which is beyond the Council's authority. Therefore, the court granted the order of prohibition to restrain the Council from proceeding, emphasizing that the Council could initiate fresh proceedings if the matter fell within its constitutional jurisdiction. Costs were awarded to the applicants.",
