  "caseTitle": "OSCAR H. REYNARD",
  "summary": "This 1934 West African Court of Appeal decision in Accra involved a dispute between Oscar H. Reynard (plaintiff-appellant) and William P. Allan (defendant-respondent) over a financial arrangement concerning land development in Upper Wassaw. The plaintiff claimed repayment of £800 17s. 8d., part of a total advance of £945 17s. 8d., which the defendant admitted owing only £145 of, arguing the remainder was a failed partnership investment. The trial judge ruled for the defendant, but the appellate court allowed the appeal, finding overwhelming documentary evidence—receipts and account statements—showing the funds were loans, not partnership contributions. The court emphasized that the defendant’s own signed receipts described payments as 'loans' and that the plaintiff received half the produce as interest, consistent with a loan agreement. The appellate court rejected the trial judge’s skepticism about the lack of oral corroboration, noting the strength of written admissions, and found the defendant’s version of a partnership implausible and commercially unreasonable. Judgment was entered for the plaintiff on the full claim.",
