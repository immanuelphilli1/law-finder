  "caseTitle": "RIGHT TO STATE APPOINTED COUNSEL IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE ADMINIS",
  "summary": "This legal analysis examines the right to state-appointed counsel in Ghana's criminal justice system under the 1992 Constitution. It argues that despite constitutional guarantees—particularly Article 14(2), Article 19(2), and the mandatory legal aid provision in Article 294—Ghanaian courts have maintained a conservative, colonial-era approach that limits access to counsel for indigent accused persons, except in capital cases like murder. The paper highlights that the right to counsel during pre-trial custody is essential for a fair trial and should be guaranteed regardless of an individual's economic status. It references landmark cases such as Okorie v The Republic, Republic v Akosah, and Marhaba v The Republic, where breaches of the right to counsel affected admissibility of confessions. The author asserts that failure to assign state-appointed counsel in cases involving constitutional rights renders proceedings a nullity, and calls for judicial recognition of international democratic principles from U.S. and U.K. jurisprudence to uphold human dignity and fair trial rights.",
