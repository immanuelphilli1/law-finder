  "caseTitle": "C. BRANDFORD - NETTEY",
  "summary": "This 1936 West Africa Court of Appeal decision arose from an interpleader action concerning land attached in execution of a judgment against C. B. Nettey. Akai Kofi Nettey claimed to represent the surviving children of Nii Nettey Quarshie, asserting an interest in the property. The lower court released the property, finding the children had an interest. The appellate court reversed, holding that the claimant lacked locus standi, as he was not a son but a nephew of Nii Nettey Quarshie, and had falsely sworn otherwise. It was admitted the property was not family property, and no other legal interest was established under native or general law. The claim was deemed a 'barefaced attempt to impose upon the Court' due to lack of transparency and contradictory arguments. The court found the judgment-debtor held absolute ownership, the interpleader claim failed, and ordered the property reattached.",
