  "summary": "In this West African Court of Appeal case, the respondent sued in a Native Court for an injunction to prevent trespass on a stream and for �100 in damages. The Native Court granted the injunction and awarded �50 in damages. As a Grade C Court, its jurisdiction for damages was limited to �50. The appellants sought certiorari to quash the proceedings, arguing lack of jurisdiction due to the original damages claim exceeding the limit. The Supreme Court upheld the injunction but quashed the damages award. On appeal, the West African Court of Appeal held that the claims were distinct, with the injunction being the primary relief sought to determine exclusive user rights, while damages were ancillary. It affirmed that the Native Court had jurisdiction to hear the matter and grant the injunction, dismissing the appeal.",
