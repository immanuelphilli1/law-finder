  "caseTitle": "SOLOMON JONAH",
  "summary": "This 1937 West Africa Court of Appeal case arose from a boundary-related dispute in Gomoa Assin, Ghana, where the plaintiff sought damages after being prevented by the defendant from accessing forest land where farms were located. The initial native tribunal awarded damages, but the native appellate tribunal reversed, finding the claim unclear and noting it was customary for the defendant to restrict access until boundaries were jointly agreed. The Provincial Commissioner then overturned the native appellate decision, treating the matter as a land ownership dispute. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that the original issue was not about land title, possession, or occupation, but about whether the defendant could lawfully restrict access pending a joint boundary agreement. It ruled that the Provincial Commissioner lacked jurisdiction because the dispute did not fall under land ownership claims, which are subject to different procedural rules. The court emphasized the importance of clarity in claims before native tribunals to determine proper jurisdiction and appeal pathways. The appeal was allowed, costs awarded, and the native appellate tribunal's judgment was restored, with counsel waiving enforcement of the �5 pacification order.",
