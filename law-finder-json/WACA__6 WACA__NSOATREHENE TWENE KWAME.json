  "caseTitle": "NSOATREHENE TWENE KWAME",
  "summary": "This 1940 West Africa Court of Appeal decision involved a land ownership dispute over Kotafo, a small but significant burial site, between Nsoatrehene Twene Kwame and Berekumhene Kojo Barnier. The Asantehene's Court 'A' originally ruled in favor of the plaintiff, confining its judgment to the specific parcel in dispute. On appeal, the Chief Commissioner's Court expanded the scope by amending the claim to include much larger surrounding areas, despite the original issue being limited to Kotafo. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that this amendment was ultra vires, rendering subsequent proceedings void due to lack of jurisdiction. The court emphasized that appellate jurisdiction could not be used to try a new and broader case not presented originally. The judgment of the Chief Commissioner's Court was set aside, and the matter was remitted for rehearing strictly on the original issue of ownership of Kotafo land. The court also affirmed the importance of clearly defining the boundaries of the disputed land through survey.",
