  "caseTitle": "INDIVIDUALISATION OF INTERESTS UNDER THE CUSTOMARY LAND LAW",
  "summary": "The article examines the judicial trend in Ghana's customary land law toward individualisation of land interests, focusing on the influential case of Lokko v. Konklofi. The Chief Justice, Sir W. Brandford Griffith, held that prolonged and uninterrupted occupation of stool land, coupled with permanent cultivation and development, could transform a subject's user right into an absolute proprietary interest, deeming such land no longer stool property but the individual's own. This decision, while grounded in socio-economic changes like perennial crop farming, mischaracterised customary tenure by conflating a valuable individual interest with full ownership. The article critiques the judgment for misunderstanding the nature of stool land, where reversionary title remains with the stool, and warns that judicial promotion of individualisation risks undermining communal landholding systems without due regard for socio-political implications.",
