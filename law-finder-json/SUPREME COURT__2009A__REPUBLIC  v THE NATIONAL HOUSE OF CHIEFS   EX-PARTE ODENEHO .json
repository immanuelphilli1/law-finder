  "caseTitle": "REPUBLIC v THE NATIONAL HOUSE OF CHIEFS EX-PARTE ODENEHO",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision arose from a chieftaincy dispute involving Odeneho Akrofa Krukoko II, who claimed rightful status as Omanhene of the Wassa Fiase Traditional Area. After multiple legal battles, including contempt convictions later overturned, his name was removed from the National Register of Chiefs and replaced with Osagyefo Kwamena Enimil VI. Odeneho sought mandamus to compel the National House of Chiefs to reinstate his name. The High Court granted leave, but the Court of Appeal dismissed the application, citing procedural defects and res judicata from a prior dismissed motion. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, clarifying that mandamus is founded on demand and refusal, with the limitation period starting from refusal. It held that interlocutory rulings do not bar subsequent actions unless they resolve the merits, and that the Court of Appeal's prior decision in Ex Parte Faibil III was per incuriam. The Court emphasized that Order 59 r.3 applied only to certiorari, not mandamus, and reversed the Court of Appeal’s judgment.",
