  "summary": "In Rex v. William Oledima, the West Africa Court of Appeal heard an appeal against a manslaughter conviction. The prosecution alleged that the appellant caused the death of Joseph Anyanwu by injecting him in the buttock, leading to a fatal infection. The medical evidence from the post-mortem indicated advanced gas gangrene and suggested that an unsterile injection could have caused the infection. However, the court held that to secure a conviction, it must be proven that the act actually caused death, not merely that it could have. Since the possibility of other causes of the gangrenous condition was not excluded, the evidence was deemed insufficient. The appeal was allowed, the conviction and sentence were quashed, and an acquittal was entered.",
