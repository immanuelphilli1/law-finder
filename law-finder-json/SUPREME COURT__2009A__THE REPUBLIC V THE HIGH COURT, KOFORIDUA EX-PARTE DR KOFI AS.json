  "caseTitle": "REPUBLIC VRS HIGH COURT, KOFORIDUA",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana ruled on an application by Dr. Kofi Asare, the New Patriotic Party's parliamentary candidate for Akwatia, who sought to quash a High Court ruling that allowed an election petition to proceed before the official declaration and gazetting of election results. The petition, filed by National Democratic Congress and independent candidates, alleged electoral malpractices and sought a rerun. The Supreme Court held that an election petition cannot be filed before results are declared, as the legal basis for such petitions—specifically, challenging 'the person whose election is questioned'—requires a declared winner. The Court emphasized that while courts can intervene in electoral matters pre-declaration under constitutional enforcement jurisdiction (e.g., to prevent illegal acts), a premature election petition under PNDCL 284 is jurisdictionally invalid. The ruling clarified the interpretation of 'election' in electoral law and reaffirmed the supremacy of the Constitution.",
