  "caseTitle": "GABRIEL KWAO BOSO VRS THE REPUBLIC",
  "summary": "In Gabriel Kwao Boso v. The Republic (2009), the Supreme Court of Ghana upheld the Court of Appeal's substitution of a murder conviction with manslaughter, affirming that the appellant caused the death of Debora Bigoor through administering dangerous drugs, though intent to kill was not proven. The Court emphasized that circumstantial evidence, including the appellant's disposal of the body and destruction of vital organs, supported the manslaughter conviction. The sentence was enhanced from 15 to 21 years with hard labour, effective from the date of arrest, in compliance with Article 14(6) of the 1992 Constitution. The Court relied on R v. Onufrejczyk and The Queen v Sharmpal Singh to affirm that death and causation can be established circumstantially even without a body or complete autopsy.",
