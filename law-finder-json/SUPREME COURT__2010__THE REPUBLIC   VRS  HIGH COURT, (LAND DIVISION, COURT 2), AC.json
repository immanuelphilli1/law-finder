  "caseTitle": "REPUBLIC VRS HIGH",
  "summary": "The Republic, on ex-parte application by Al-Hassan Limited, sought certiorari and prohibition from the Supreme Court to quash a High Court (Land Division) ruling that set aside a supplementary affidavit filed in support of an interlocutory injunction application in a land dispute against Thaddeus Sory. The applicant alleged breach of natural justice, particularly audi alteram partem, and judicial bias. The Supreme Court dismissed the application, holding that both parties were heard before the High Court's decision, which fell within judicial discretion under Order 81 of C.I. 47. The Court emphasized that certiorari is not a substitute for appeal and is only available for fundamental or jurisdictional errors, not mere disagreements with discretionary rulings. It reaffirmed that supervisory jurisdiction is exercised sparingly and only where there is a clear breach of natural justice or fundamental error. The applicant retained the right to be heard on the pending injunction motion through other procedural means, and no actual bias was demonstrated. The distinction between appeal and certiorari was underscored as essential to proper judicial process.",
