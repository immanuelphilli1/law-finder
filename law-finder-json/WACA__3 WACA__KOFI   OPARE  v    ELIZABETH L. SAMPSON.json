  "summary": "This appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal at Accra on 21st April 1937 concerned the reversal by a Provincial Commissioner of a native tribunal's judgment in a land dispute. The appellant, Kofi Opare, challenged the reversal, arguing that the Provincial Commissioner overstepped his authority. The Court held that under colonial legislation, native tribunals have exclusive original jurisdiction over land held under native tenure, and their factual findings—especially on matters within their specialized knowledge—should not be disturbed unless clearly wrong. Relying on the Privy Council's decision in Abakah Nthah v. Anguah Bennieh, the Court found no such clear error and ruled that the Provincial Commissioner erred in reversing the native tribunal's decision based merely on a differing assessment of the evidence. The appeal was allowed, the Provincial Commissioner's judgment was set aside, and the original judgment of the Omanhene of Akyem Abuakwa was restored. Costs were awarded to the appellant.",
