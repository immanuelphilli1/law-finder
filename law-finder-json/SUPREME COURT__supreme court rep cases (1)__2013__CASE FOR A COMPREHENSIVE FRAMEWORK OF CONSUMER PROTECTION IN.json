  "caseTitle": "CASE FOR A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK OF CONSUMER PROTECTION IN",
  "summary": "This academic article analyzes the state of consumer protection law in Ghana, focusing on the Price Control Decree, 1974. It highlights the persistence of unfair trading practices such as profiteering and hoarding despite legislative efforts. The author argues that while criminal sanctions exist to deter violations—such as selling above controlled prices or hoarding essential goods—the legal framework fails to provide adequate civil remedies for consumers. Although Section 4(b) of the Decree mandates that convicted traders pay double the overcharged amount to affected buyers, this compensation is treated as a windfall rather than an enforceable right. The article concludes that existing laws are insufficient and calls for a comprehensive consumer protection framework to ensure fair pricing, product quality, and the exclusion of dishonest traders from the market.",
