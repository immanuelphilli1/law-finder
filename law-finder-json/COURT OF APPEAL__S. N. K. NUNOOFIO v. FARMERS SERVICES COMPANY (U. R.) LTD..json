  "summary": "In S. N. K. Nunoo Fio v. Farmers Services Company (U.R.) Ltd., the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's ruling that the respondent's demotion and subsequent termination were wrongful. The demotion from Commercial Manager to Area Commercial Officer, cited as being due to poor performance and internal conflict, constituted a disciplinary action under the Senior Staff Conditions of Service (Exhibit A, section 54(E)), which required formal charges and an opportunity for the employee to defend himself—procedures that were not followed. The termination letter, while citing section 63 (allowing termination with two months’ notice or pay in lieu), also assigned condemnatory reasons related to the employee's conduct, effectively treating it as a disciplinary dismissal without due process. The court held that such an action violated procedural fairness, particularly paragraph (e) of section 54(E), which voids any adverse action where the employee is denied a hearing. The appeal was dismissed, affirming that both demotion and termination were null and void.",
