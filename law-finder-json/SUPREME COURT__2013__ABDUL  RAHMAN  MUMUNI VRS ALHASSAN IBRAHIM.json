  "summary": "In this civil appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana, the court identified evidence of a negotiated settlement in the record where the plaintiff proposed dividing a property into two parts for peaceful resolution, which the defendant had agreed to. Although the settlement was not formally pleaded, the court invoked the doctrine of estoppel and the principle of interest rei publicae ut sit finis litium to uphold the agreement. The court amended the plaintiff's writ to include a claim for enforcement of the settlement and ordered the division of the property: the plaintiff received three uncompleted buildings and four completed ones (including a hall and chamber), while the respondent received the remaining seven completed rooms (also including a hall and chamber). Rents paid into court were to be distributed equally. The decision reflects judicial support for amicable dispute resolution under customary law.",
