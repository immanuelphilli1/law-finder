  "caseTitle": "COMPLICITY UNDER THE CRIMINAL CODE OF GHANA UNDER THE CRIMIN",
  "summary": "This academic analysis by Mensa-Bonsu examines complicity under Ghana's Criminal Code, 1960 (Act 29), focusing on sections 20 and 21. It explains that 'abetment' encompasses various forms of participation in crime—such as instigating, commanding, counseling, procuring, or facilitating—and eliminates traditional common law distinctions between types of accomplices. The article emphasizes that abetment must occur before or during the commission of the crime, citing Commissioner of Police v Sarpey and Nyamekye to illustrate that post-commission assistance does not attract liability under Act 29. It further discusses the legislative intent behind the broad terminology, arguing that each term in the list carries distinct meaning. The analysis also highlights the moral and legal rationale for holding abettors criminally liable, particularly to deter indirect encouragement of crime. Despite limited judicial discussion in Ghana, the piece calls for greater appreciation and application of complicity laws in criminal prosecutions.",
