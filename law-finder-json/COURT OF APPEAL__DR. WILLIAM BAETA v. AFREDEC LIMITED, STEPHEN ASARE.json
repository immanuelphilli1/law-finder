  "caseTitle": "WILLIAM BAETA v. AFREDEC LIMITED, STEPHEN ASARE",
  "summary": "In this Court of Appeal decision, Dr. William Baeta, the judgment creditor, sought enforcement of a 1994 judgment against Afredec Limited, the judgment debtor. The property in dispute, House Number J.856/5 Mile 11, Nungua, Accra, was attached in May 1997. Stephen Asare, the applicant, claimed ownership through a 1997 agreement with Mrs. Clocanus Mensah, the company's Managing Director, supported by Exhibit 2(A), which referenced two cheques dated August 1997 for payment. However, the court found the agreement invalid because the cheques were issued after the May 1997 attachment, and no specific property details or site plan were included, failing to meet conveyancing requirements under NRCD 175. The court also dismissed a later claim of purchase from the Nungua Stool in 1998 as an afterthought. The transactions were deemed fraudulent attempts to obstruct execution. The applicant failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on appeal, and thus the application for stay of execution was dismissed.",
