  "caseTitle": "REPUBLIC v. OPANYIN EKRA KWAME & ANOR",
  "summary": "This Court of Appeal case from Ghana addressed whether the appellants, Opanyin Ekra Kwame and another, were rightly convicted of contempt for failing to surrender the 'black stool' and all 'Bombae drums' of Kwesimintim to the Western Regional House of Chiefs. The High Court had convicted them based solely on affidavits, particularly one from the Registrar of the House of Chiefs, who claimed the surrendered stool was a kitchen stool and only three of six drums were returned. The appellants protested at the hearing that they had fully complied. The Court of Appeal held that contempt being quasi-criminal requires proof beyond reasonable doubt, and it was erroneous to base conviction solely on untested affidavit evidence without oral testimony or cross-examination, especially when material facts were disputed. The trial judge’s reliance on the Registrar’s unchallenged affidavit was deemed inappropriate, as the appellants had orally contested the claims. The appeal was allowed, and the conviction quashed due to procedural unfairness and failure to meet the required standard of proof.",
