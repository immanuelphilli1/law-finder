  "summary": "This legal commentary examines the doctrine of customary arbitration in Ghana, tracing its development through judicial decisions from 1883 to 1962. It emphasizes that customary arbitration is a recognized mode of dispute resolution under Ghanaian law, preserved by statutes such as the Chieftaincy Act, 1961, and protected under constitutional and common law principles. The article outlines five essential characteristics of valid customary arbitration: (i) voluntary submission with informed consent, (ii) prior agreement to accept the award, (iii) a non-arbitrary decision reached judicially after hearing both sides, (iv) adherence to local Native Court procedures, and (v) publication of the award. Key cases like Budu II v Caesar, Asare v Donkor, Paul v Kokoo, and Donkor v Isifu clarify that mere attendance at a meeting does not constitute submission, and full understanding of the arbitration process is required. The Supreme Court resolved earlier conflicts in jurisprudence, affirming that customary arbitration, while distinct from statutory arbitration, remains a legitimate and enforceable method of adjudication in Ghana.",
