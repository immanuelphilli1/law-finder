  "summary": "In Janet Naakarley Amegatcher v. The Attorney-General & The Electoral Commission (Supreme Court, Writ No. J1/8/2012, 26th July 2012), the plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of sections of the Local Government Act, 1993 (Act 462), particularly provisions empowering the President to create districts by executive instrument. The plaintiff argued that under Article 241(2) and Article 106(1) of the 1992 Constitution, only Parliament has the authority to create or reconstitute districts through legislation, not the President via executive action. The Supreme Court, applying constitutional interpretation principles, held that the power to create districts resides with Parliament, and thus section 1(2) of Act 462, which allows the President to declare areas as districts, is inconsistent with the Constitution and void. The Court emphasized that district creation involves significant governance and political implications, necessitating parliamentary oversight to prevent abuse for partisan purposes.",
