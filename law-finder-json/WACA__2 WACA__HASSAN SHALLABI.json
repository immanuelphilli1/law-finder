  "caseTitle": "HASSAN SHALLABI",
  "summary": "In this 1935 West African Court of Appeal case from Accra, Ghana, appellants Hassan Shallabi and Adib Sabih were convicted of stealing and conspiracy under sections 276 and 49(1) of the Criminal Code. The convictions were quashed due to a material error in the charge: the information cited section 276, but no evidence supported any of its specific subsections, and the trial judge failed to explain the legal requirements under that section to the jury. The court found this constituted a serious misdirection. Additionally, the prosecution's suggestion that section 275 was intended was rejected as a substantial drafting error, not a clerical one, and non-compliance with section 202 of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance was noted. The conspiracy conviction was invalidated as dependent on the principal offence. The sentence was also flawed for not imposing separate terms per count, creating ambiguity regarding fines and default imprisonment. The appeals were allowed, and both convictions and sentences were annulled.",
