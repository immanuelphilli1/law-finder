  "caseTitle": "ANKOBRA GOLDFIELDS LTD. v. JAMES ANDERSON & OR.",
  "summary": "The Court of Appeal of Ghana set aside a summary judgment entered by the Circuit Court in favor of Royal Ankobra Goldfields Ltd. against James Anderson and others, ruling that the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case due to the claim's value exceeding its statutory limit of GHS 10,000,000. The plaintiff had sought specific performance of a contract for the sale of 100kg of gold valued at $730,000, with a balance of $670,000 unpaid. Despite a jurisdictional objection raised by the defendant, the trial judge failed to address it or follow the statutory procedure under Section 41 of the Courts Act, 1993 (Act 459), which requires either referral to the High Court or obtaining the parties' agreement to proceed. The appellate court held that the trial court’s assumption of jurisdiction rendered the entire proceedings a nullity, making it unnecessary to consider other grounds of appeal. The appeal was allowed solely on jurisdictional grounds.",
