  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF JAMES TAYLOR, DECEASED",
  "summary": "The appellant, David Osagbudo Okadike, was convicted in the High Court for preparation to coin gold and silver under section 148(3)(c) of the Criminal Code, following evidence related solely to the production of pennies. The West African Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and sentence, and ordered an acquittal. The court held that since the statutory offense required preparation to coin gold or silver (including high-value mixed-metal coins), and the evidence showed only activity concerning low-denomination copper pennies, the conviction could not stand. The court considered substituting a conviction under section 154(2) for counterfeiting nickel coins but declined, as the exhibits were not suitable for that purpose. The appeal was allowed due to a fatal mismatch between the charge and the evidence.",
