  "summary": "This 2011 Supreme Court of Ghana case involved a land dispute between Kwadwo Sasu Bamfo (Appellant) and Kwesi Sintim (Respondent) over a parcel of land at North Taifa, Accra. The Appellant claimed title via a 1990 lease agreement with Numo Kpanie Mensah, head of the Neefu family, while the Respondent denied the lease's validity, alleging forgery, and counterclaimed based on a 2005 lease from a different family representative. The Appellant presented a witness who testified to the 1990 execution and authenticity of the lease (Ex 'A'), including identifying the lessor's thumbprint and his own signature as a witness. However, the witness admitted the lessor died in 1993, raising questions about the document's date. The Respondent argued the lease was forged and executed after the lessor's death. The court ultimately found the Appellant's evidence unconvincing, particularly due to inconsistencies in the execution date and lack of credible authentication, and ruled in favor of the Respondent, upholding the trial court's decision to dismiss the Appellant's claim and grant the Respondent's counterclaim for title, possession, and damages.",
