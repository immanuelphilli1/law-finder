  "caseTitle": "REX V P. H. BRAVO JONES",
  "summary": "The appellant, P. H. Bravo Jones, was charged with forcible entry under 5 Ric. II c. 7 in Sierra Leone's Supreme Court. After the defense closed, the court amended the charge to 21 Jac. 1 c. 15 without requiring a new plea or allowing further defense. The jury convicted, and a fine or imprisonment was imposed. On appeal, the West African Court of Appeal held that amending the charge after the defense closed—especially to a substantively different offense—constituted a serious injustice. The court emphasized that such an amendment altered the nature of the charge and denied the appellant a fair opportunity to respond. The conviction and sentence were quashed, and an acquittal was entered.",
