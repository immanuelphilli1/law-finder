  "caseTitle": "LT GN S.EDMUND MENSAH VRS THE REPUBLIC",
  "summary": "Lieutenant (GN) S. Edmund Mensah, a commissioned officer in the Ghana Armed Forces, was convicted by a General Court Martial on three counts under Section 54(1) of the Armed Forces Act, 1962 (Act 105), following his guilty plea. The charges stemmed from his marriage to a female other rank, AB1 Dosu Theresa, on 13 July 2008, without her obtaining prior approval for release from service as required by CSIP Vol. 3, Section 1, Article 1.179. The prosecution established that the marriage occurred while both parties were in active service, constituting an act prejudicial to good order and discipline. The appellant initially pleaded not guilty but later changed his plea to guilty after counsel advised him to do so. He was sentenced to dismissal from the Armed Forces under Section 78(1)(e) of Act 105. On appeal, the appellant challenged the harshness of the sentence, the legality of the conviction, and the constitutionality of the regulation, arguing it was discriminatory and a colonial relic. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that the right to amend grounds of appeal was not barred, the conviction was lawful, and the regulation served legitimate disciplinary objectives. The court affirmed the sentence, emphasizing the necessity of discipline in military institutions.",
