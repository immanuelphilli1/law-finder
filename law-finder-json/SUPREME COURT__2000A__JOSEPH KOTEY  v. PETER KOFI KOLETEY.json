  "caseTitle": "KOTEY v. PETER KOFI KOLETEY",
  "summary": "In Joseph Kotey v. Peter Kofi Koletey, the Supreme Court of Ghana considered an application for special leave to appeal under Article 131(2) of the 1992 Constitution, filed out of time after the applicant missed the 14-day window to seek leave from the Court of Appeal. The applicant attributed the delay to his lawyer's failure to timely apply for leave, having instead pursued a stay of execution. The Court reaffirmed its unfettered discretion under Article 131(2) and Rule 7(4) of C.I. 16 to grant special leave despite procedural delays, citing the need to prevent a failure of justice. Relying on Dolphyne v. Speedline Stevedoring, the Court emphasized that special leave may be granted where there is a prima facie error, a novel legal issue, or public interest. It held that while finality in litigation is important, litigants should not be unduly penalized for counsel's mistakes, especially when justice so requires. The application was granted based on the merits and equitable considerations.",
