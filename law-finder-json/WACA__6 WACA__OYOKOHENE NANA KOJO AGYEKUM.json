  "summary": "This civil appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal concerned a land boundary dispute between the stools of Acherensua and Kwesiasi in Ashanti, Ghana. The plaintiffs claimed damages for trespass and a declaration of ownership over land in Ahafo, asserting that the boundary was the Kosu River as determined by an executive decision of Chief Commissioner Sir Francis Fuller in 1913. The defendants argued the decision established only a political boundary between the Ahafos and Odumasis. The Court examined Exhibit D, the validated executive decision, and held it clearly resolved a land ownership dispute between Acherensua and Kwesiasi, with the Kosu River as the boundary. The Court found the trespass occurred on Acherensua land and affirmed the Chief Commissioner’s Court judgment, dismissing the appeal. It also allowed an amendment to the writ to include a declaration of ownership and awarded costs.",
