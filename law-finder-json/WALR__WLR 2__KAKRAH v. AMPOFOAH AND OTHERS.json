  "caseTitle": "KAKRAH VERSUS AMPOFOAH",
  "summary": "The Nyakrom Stool had granted a usufructuary interest in stool land to James Obodai, a stranger, who paid an annual rent of \u0002. Upon his death intestate, his estate was apportioned by the legally appointed successor, Mr. Forster, who allocated the disputed land to Obodai's children. The stool later demanded a financial contribution toward an unrelated stool debt and sought to increase the annual rent to \u00012, both of which the children refused. The stool sued to compel a new agreement and to reclaim portions of the land. The Supreme Court held that the stool could not impose fines for debts unconnected to the land or unilaterally vary the original rent. The children, having been duly allotted the land under native law and custom, succeeded to their father's rights and obligations as of right. The court affirmed that the land did not revert to the stool upon Obodai's death and that the children were the proper parties to sue. The appeal was dismissed with costs to the defendants.",
