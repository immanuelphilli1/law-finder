  "summary": "This legal commentary by Mills J.E.A. examines the development, structure, and judicial interpretation of Ghana's Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179). It traces the historical evolution from the outdated 1907 Companies Ordinance to the modernized Code drafted under Professor LCB Gower’s leadership. The article highlights the Code’s innovative features—such as the introduction of one-man companies, the fusion of Memorandum and Articles into 'Regulations', no-par value shares, and the mitigation of the ultra vires doctrine—and emphasizes its role in promoting business continuity and accountability. While rooted in English common law principles, the Code is not a mere replica but a tailored legal framework designed for Ghanaian socio-economic conditions. The courts are tasked with interpreting and developing the Code, thereby providing the 'flesh' to its 'skeleton'. Gower’s Final Report, though not binding, is recognized as a crucial interpretive aid in understanding the Code’s objectives and provisions.",
