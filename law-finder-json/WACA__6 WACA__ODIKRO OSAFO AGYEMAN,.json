  "summary": "This 1940 decision by the West Africa Court of Appeal (WACA) addressed a claim for rent and tribute related to cocoa farms in the Adansi area of Ghana. The court held that the Divisional Court lacked jurisdiction, as the matter fell under the authority of Adansi Native Court 'B' per the Native Courts (Confederacy) Order. The appeal was allowed, lower court proceedings were stayed, and the parties were referred to the competent Native Court. The appellant, who had raised the jurisdictional issue early, was awarded costs in both courts.",
