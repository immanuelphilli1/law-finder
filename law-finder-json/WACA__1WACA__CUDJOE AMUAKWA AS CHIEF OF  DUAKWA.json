  "summary": "This 1932 West African Court of Appeal case involved a boundary dispute between two divisional chiefs, Ohene Appoh Ababio of Assenta and Ohene Doku Kanga of Kickam, both under the Omanhene of Eastern Nzima in Ghana. The dispute centered on the Agona lands near the Biale River, specifically whether the boundary ran westward to the sea or southward from a bridge to the Bobloma creek. The lower tribunals dismissed the claim based on res judicata from a prior case, Anopoley v. Athunli, which had settled the same boundary. The Court of Appeal held that res judicata did not apply because the plaintiff was neither a party nor a privy in the earlier suit. However, the prior judgment was deemed admissible as evidence of customary land ownership. The court found ample evidence supporting the lower courts' decision and dismissed the appeal with costs, affirming the boundary as defined in the earlier ruling.",
