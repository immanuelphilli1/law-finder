  "caseTitle": "ALAN WILLIAM HODGSON V THE REPUBLIC",
  "summary": "Alan William Hodgson appealed his conviction and 20-year sentence for criminal conspiracy and unlawful possession of 588.33 kilograms of cocaine under the Narcotic Drugs (Control, Enforcement and Sanctions) Law, P.N.D.C. L 236. He challenged the charges as defective for failing to specify the type of narcotic drug involved and argued there was insufficient evidence to link him to the offence, claiming his presence at the scene was coincidental. The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed the appeal, holding that the charges provided reasonable information under Section 112(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code and that the defect did not amount to a substantial miscarriage of justice under Section 31(2) of the Courts Act, 1993. The Court found credible evidence connecting the appellant to the conspiracy, including his alleged role in transporting the drugs from Prampram to Tema. It distinguished this case from John David Logan & Anor v The Republic, where appeals were allowed due to lack of evidence, noting stronger proof here. The Court also upheld the 20-year sentence as proportionate to the severity of the crime. Constitutional challenges under Article 19(2) were rejected, affirming both the trial and appellate courts' decisions.",
