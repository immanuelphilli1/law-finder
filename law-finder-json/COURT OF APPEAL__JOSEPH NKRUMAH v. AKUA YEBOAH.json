  "caseTitle": "JOSEPH NKRUMAH v. AKUA YEBOAH",
  "summary": "This Court of Appeal decision from Ghana, delivered on 28th May 2004, concerns a land dispute between Joseph Nkrumah (plaintiff/respondent) and Akua Yeboah (defendant/appellant) over customary land in Sayerano, Sefwi. The plaintiff claimed title as the customary successor to his uncle, with the land included in a 1995 family property inventory (Exhibit 'B'). The defendant contested this, asserting her father independently owned the land and was not part of the plaintiff’s family, thus rejecting claims of inheritance. Two customary arbitrations before the Sayerano chief and elders ruled in favor of the plaintiff, with the second award being deemed valid and binding by the trial judge. The Circuit Court granted the plaintiff all reliefs, including a declaration of title and GH¢1 million in trespass damages. The defendant appealed, arguing the trial judge failed to assess the legal effect of customary arbitration, distinguish enforcement from resubmission, and differentiate arbitration from adjudication. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial court’s findings, affirming that a valid customary arbitration award has res judicata effect and is binding, dismissing the appeal due to lack of merit and procedural deficiencies in the grounds raised.",
