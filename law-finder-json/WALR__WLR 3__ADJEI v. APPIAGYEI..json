  "summary": "In Adjei v. Appiagyei (1958) W.A.L.R. 3, the Court of Appeal of Ghana set aside a lower court's decision to cancel a 1951 mortgage of family land, holding that the plaintiff failed to meet the legal burden required to rescind such a transaction. The plaintiff, claiming to represent the family of Kofi Attim, alleged fraud and lack of family consent, particularly challenging the status of Yaw Kunadu as family head and signatory to the mortgage deed. However, the court found that the plaintiff did not prove his own standing, failed to plead or prove fraud with sufficient particularity, and did not demonstrate that the family had not acquiesced, had acted timeously, or that the defendant could be restored to his pre-transaction position. The court emphasized that a transaction by a family head without family consent is voidable, not void, and that the burden lies on the plaintiff to establish non-acquiescence, due diligence, and restitutio in integrum. The defendant, a successor to the original mortgagee, was protected as a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, especially given the Asantehene’s prior written consent and proper title searches. The appeal was allowed, and the cancellation order was reversed.",
