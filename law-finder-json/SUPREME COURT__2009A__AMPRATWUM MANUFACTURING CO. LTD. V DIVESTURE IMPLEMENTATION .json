  "caseTitle": "AMPRATWUM MANUFACTURING CO. LTD. V DIVESTURE IMPLEMENTATION",
  "summary": "The case involved Ampatwum Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (Appellant) seeking compensation of 436 million old Ghana cedis for structural improvements made to a warehouse leased from GIHOC Footwear Company Limited, which was later divested by the Divestiture Implementation Committee (DIC). The High Court initially ruled for the Appellant, but the Court of Appeal set aside the judgment, holding that the DIC was not the proper defendant. The Supreme Court upheld this procedural point but found the Court of Appeal should have substituted the Attorney-General as the proper party under Order 4 Rule 5 of CI 47. On the merits, the Supreme Court dismissed the claim, ruling no unjust enrichment occurred because the improvements were for the tenant’s benefit, did not increase rent, and the property was sold as a cloakroom without valuation uplift. The appellant failed to offset improvement costs against rent or claim compensation earlier.",

    "Order 4 Rule 5 of CI 47 allows substitution of parties; Court of Appeal erred in dismissing rather than substituting the Attorney-General.",
    "No unjust enrichment: improvements were for tenant’s benefit, did not increase rent, and were not claimed during tenancy.",
    "The property was valued and sold as a cloakroom (26 million cedis each), not reflecting any uplift from the temporary structures.",
    "Equitable claims require clean hands; the tenant enjoyed six years of benefit without compensation claims or rent offsets.",
    "The tenant failed to demand compensation earlier or negotiate rent reduction, weakening its claim.",
    "Improvements may have diminished property value, requiring new owner to reconvert the space.",
    "The advisory role of DIC in divestiture does not create liability for tenant claims."
