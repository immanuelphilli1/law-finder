  "caseTitle": "CHOU SEN LIN v TONADO ENTERPRISES LTD , T. A. ASIAMAH",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case involved a land dispute between Chou Sen Lin (plaintiff/appellant) and Tonado Enterprises Ltd and T. A. Asiamah (defendants/respondents) over three plots (LI 1, 2, 3) in Tema. The land was originally leased by the Tema Development Corporation (TDC) to W. C. Tandoh in 1974, who later sold his interest to the plaintiff. The plaintiff developed two plots and sought to protect the third from encroachment by the defendants, who claimed to have acquired plot LI 3 in 1976. The Circuit Court initially ruled for the defendants, but the Court of Appeal reversed, declaring title in favor of the plaintiff. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision, finding that the plaintiff’s title, traced to 1974, predated the defendants’ claim. The TDC’s own witness (DW2) admitted the allocation to the defendants was an error. The Court rejected arguments based on ground rent payments and registration, noting they do not override prior valid possession and transfer. The judgment emphasized that corroborated evidence, including from the defendants’ witness, supported the plaintiff’s claim, and reaffirmed the principle of nemo dat quod non habet.",
