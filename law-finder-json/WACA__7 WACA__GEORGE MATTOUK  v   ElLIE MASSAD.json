  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF JAMES TAYLOR, DECEASED",
  "summary": "In this 1941 West Africa Court of Appeal case, George Mattouk sued Elie Massad for damages arising from the alleged seduction and carnal knowledge of Mattouk's daughter, Mary, who was nearly seventeen at the time. The Kumasi Divisional Court awarded Mattouk £1,200 in damages, which Massad appealed. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, finding that the trial judge erred in accepting the uncorroborated testimony of the girl, whose account of two rapes was deemed manifestly incredible and lacking in any corroborative evidence. The appellate court emphasized that while demeanor is important, it cannot override the implausibility of the testimony when no other circumstances support credibility. The judgment criticized the trial judge for failing to analyze the details of the girl’s story and for substituting an unsupported finding of seduction despite the plaintiff’s case being based solely on allegations of rape.",
