  "caseTitle": "UNITED AFRA CO.,LTD v JAMES EGGAY TAYLOR",
  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal allowed an appeal concerning ownership of land in Kumasi, Ghana, previously leased under an agreement dated 25 November 1927 between the Government of Ashanti and Chief Kwadjo Apaw, Omanhene of Agona. The respondent claimed the land as stool property, but the court held that the lease was taken by Apaw in his individual capacity, not on behalf of the Agona Stool, because neither the elders nor the linguist joined in the agreement, as required by Ashanti native law and custom. The court emphasized that Apaw, being illiterate and unable to understand English, could not be presumed to have understood the document, but he did not claim mistake, and it was clear he intended to bind himself personally. The agreement, being in English form, was governed by English law. A subsequent indenture from May 1928 involving construction of a stool house, though consented to by elders, did not alter the original lease's character. The court concluded that Apaw was the sole lessee, and thus his interest could be lawfully seized in execution. The lower court’s judgment was set aside, the claim dismissed, and costs awarded to appellants.",
