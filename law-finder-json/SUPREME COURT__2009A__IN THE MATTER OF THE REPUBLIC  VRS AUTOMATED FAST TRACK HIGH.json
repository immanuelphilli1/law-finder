  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an application for certiorari seeking to quash a Fast Track High Court judgment that awarded GHC100,000.00 to an employee after her wrongful dismissal. The applicant, State Housing Company Ltd, argued that the trial judge became functus officio after her October 25, 2007 ruling and lacked jurisdiction to receive further evidence on February 6, 2008, and issue a final judgment on March 20, 2008, without notice. The Supreme Court held that the October 25 ruling was interlocutory, as it explicitly suspended the final award pending further evidence, and thus the trial court retained jurisdiction. It also found that the applicant waived its right to be heard by refusing to participate in the February 6 hearing. Although the Court agreed that the grounds for the application arose on March 20, 2008, it dismissed the motion as it was filed one day beyond the 90-day limit prescribed by Supreme Court Rule 62, rendering it time-barred.",
