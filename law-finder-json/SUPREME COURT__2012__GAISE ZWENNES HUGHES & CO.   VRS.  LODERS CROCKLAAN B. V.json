  "caseTitle": "GAISE ZWENNES HUGHES & CO. VRS. LODERS CROCKLAAN B. V",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision from 2012 concerns a legal fee dispute between law firm Gaise Zwennes Hughes & Co. (plaintiff/appellant) and its client Loders Crocklaan B.V. (defendant/respondent). The law firm had recovered a US$3.56 million settlement for the client in a commercial dispute but sought to recover US$44,500 in fees based on their retainer agreement. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal because the firm failed to comply with Section 30(1) of the Legal Profession Act, 1960 (Act 32), which mandates that a bill of fees must be served on the client at least one month before commencing legal action to recover fees. Despite the client not raising this procedural defect in lower courts, the Court held that non-compliance with this statutory requirement rendered the action fundamentally invalid, as it is a mandatory precondition for suit. The Court emphasized its authority under Rule 6(7)(b) of CI 16 to raise such jurisdictional issues sua sponte to uphold the rule of law, citing Nartey v Gati [2010] SCGLR 745 and Ayarna & Anor v Agyemang & Ors [1976] 1 GLR 306 as binding precedents.",
