  "caseTitle": "SAMUEL ABENGOWE",
  "summary": "Samuel Abengowe was convicted of manslaughter for allegedly causing the death of Nwantu Oriaku through an injection administered without medical qualification. The deceased, who had long-standing syphilis and sores, died shortly after receiving an injection from Abengowe. A post-mortem could not determine the cause of death due to decomposition. The prosecution failed to specify the exact nature of the alleged negligence—whether due to a dirty needle, contaminated liquid, or overdose of poison. The trial court wrongly excluded the Government Analyst's report, which could have clarified whether poison was present. The appellate court held that there was insufficient evidence to establish that the injection caused or accelerated death, and that the conviction could not be sustained on speculative grounds. The appeal was allowed, the conviction quashed, and an acquittal entered.",
