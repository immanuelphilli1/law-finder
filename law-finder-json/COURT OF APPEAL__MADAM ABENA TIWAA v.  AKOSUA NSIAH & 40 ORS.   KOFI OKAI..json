  "caseTitle": "ABENA TIWAA v. AKOSUA NSIAH & 40 ORS. KOFI OKAI.",
  "summary": "In this civil appeal before the Ghana Court of Appeal, the respondent (Madam Abena Tiwaa) had obtained a judgment in the High Court, Kumasi, declaring her title to a parcel of land at Asokori on Asokore Stool lands, bounded by properties of Kwasi Owusu, Kwasi Dadaa, Yaw Darkwa, and the Mununkum and Yamoah Naama streams, and was granted a perpetual injunction and damages. The appellants challenged the judgment primarily on the ground that the land description was vague and insufficient. The Court of Appeal upheld the lower court's decision, holding that the description—though lacking precise measurements or a survey plan—was adequate, as it included identifiable boundary markers and adjacent landowners. The court relied on the principle in Anane v Donkor that land must be clearly identifiable for enforcement and res judicata, but found the description sufficient in this case. Additionally, the court applied estoppel by conduct under NRCD 323 s 26, noting the appellants' silence during key testimony. The unchallenged evidence of trespass by the respondent's star witness (PW3), who admitted crossing a known boundary, further corroborated the respondent's title. The appeal was dismissed in its entirety.",
