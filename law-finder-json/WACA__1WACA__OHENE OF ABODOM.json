  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF ORDER No",
  "summary": "The appellant, Ohene of Abodom, sought a writ of certiorari to quash Order No. 30 of 1932 made by the Governor under section 121 of the Native Administration Ordinance, which dealt with the constitutional relationship between a Divisional Chief and the Paramount Chief under native customary law. The West African Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that the Governor was acting in an executive capacity, not a judicial one, and thus certiorari was not available. Furthermore, the court affirmed that section 35 of the Ordinance expressly barred judicial review of such matters, preserving the separation between customary political structures and judicial oversight.",
