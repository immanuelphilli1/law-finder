  "caseTitle": "ATTORNEY GENERAL & ANOR. v APAADE LODGE LIMITED",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an application by Apaade Lodge Limited for a stay of execution of a High Court default judgment from 4 April 2006. The applicant had failed to appeal the judgment directly and instead appealed a later decision by the Court of Appeal. The Court held that under Article 129(4) of the 1992 Constitution and Rule 20 of the Supreme Court Rules (C.I. 16), it could only grant a stay of execution on an appeal against an executable judgment, which was not the case here. The Court emphasized that inherent jurisdiction cannot create appellate jurisdiction where none exists and reaffirmed that procedural rules must be followed strictly to prevent abuse of process and ensure legal certainty.",
