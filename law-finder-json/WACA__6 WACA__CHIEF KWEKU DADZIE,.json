  "caseTitle": "CHIEF KWEKU DADZIE,",
  "summary": "This 1940 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Accra involved Chief Kwaku Dadzie, representing the Anona Stool and Family of Breman, who sought a declaration of title to Eborhu land, an account of rents, and an injunction against defendants Atta Kojo and Kojo Appeanya. The Native Tribunal initially ruled in favor of the plaintiff, but the Provincial Commissioner reversed the decision, primarily due to the defendant's Certificate of Purchase from a Fi. Fa. sale and the plaintiff's 12-year delay. The appellate court reinstated the Native Tribunal's judgment, holding that ownership rights under native law are not extinguished by lapse of time and that sufficient evidence supported the finding that the defendant only acquired a tenant's interest. The claim for an account of rents was withdrawn on appeal.",
