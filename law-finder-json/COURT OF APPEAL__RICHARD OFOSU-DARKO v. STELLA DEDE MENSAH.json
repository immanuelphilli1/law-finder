  "caseTitle": "RICHARD OFOSU-DARKO v. STELLA DEDE MENSAH",
  "summary": "In Richard Ofosu-Darko v. Stella Dede Mensah, a 2003 Court of Appeal decision in Ghana, the appellant, Stella Dede Mensah, appealed the trial court's judgment in favor of the respondent, Richard Ofosu-Darko, who had established ownership and possession of a disputed property. The respondent proved title through documentary evidence, including a Land Certificate (Exhibit 'J'), and corroborated oral testimony from witnesses. The appellant failed to call key witnesses who granted her title and could not prove possession or direct documentary linkage to the land. Although a court-appointed surveyor noted minor discrepancies in the plans, these did not undermine the conclusion that both parties referred to the same parcel of land. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial court’s finding that possession coupled with better title entitled the respondent to judgment. The appeal was dismissed, and the appellant was ordered to pay ₵3 million in costs.",
