  "caseTitle": "JOHN ONI AKERELE v THE KING",
  "summary": "Dr. John Oni Akerele, a qualified medical practitioner in Nigeria, was convicted of manslaughter for the death of a child, Kalu Ibe, following administration of Sobita (sodium bismuth tartrate) during a public health campaign for yaws. The West African Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, finding that the doctor had criminally negligently prepared an overly concentrated solution, leading to bismuth poisoning. The Privy Council affirmed that evidence of nine other children's deaths and illnesses was properly admitted to demonstrate that the reaction was not due to individual idiosyncrasy but to a dangerously strong mixture. The key issue was whether the negligence amounted to a criminal degree, with the court emphasizing that criminal negligence must go beyond mere civil fault and show a gross disregard for life. The appeal against conviction was dismissed, affirming the standard that gross negligence in medical practice can constitute manslaughter.",
