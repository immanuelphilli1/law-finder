  "summary": "In Merchant Bank Ghana Ltd. v. Similar Ways Ltd., the Supreme Court of Ghana considered an application for an interim injunction to restrain enforcement of a High Court judgment delivered on 8th January 2009, which the appellant claimed was irregular due to lack of service of the hearing notice. The appellant had previously sought to set aside the judgment and obtain a stay of execution at the High Court and Court of Appeal, all of which were dismissed. The Court of Appeal held that the appeal was not properly premised as it did not challenge the substantive judgment. The Supreme Court emphasized that courts possess inherent and residual powers under Article 126(2) of the 1992 Constitution and rules such as CI 16 r.5 and CI 19 r.7 to grant interlocutory relief, including injunctions, even where not explicitly provided. Relying on In Re Yendi Skin Affairs, the Court affirmed that interim remedies may be granted to protect a party's interest pending appeal, particularly where a court default could cause irreparable harm. The Court recognized the power to suspend the entry of judgment to prevent execution when justice so requires, preserving the appellant’s right to effective appeal.",
