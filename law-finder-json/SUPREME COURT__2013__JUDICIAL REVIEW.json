  "summary": "This 2013 Supreme Court of Ghana judgment concerns a chieftaincy dispute over the succession to the Omanhene stool of Kenyasi No. 1 following the death of the previous chief. The Queenmother, Nana Yaa Adutwumwaa, nominated Osei Kofi Abiri as successor, but Nana Antwi Bosiako, a royal claimant, invoked the Great Oath of Otumfuo (Ntamkese) challenging both the nominee's lineage and the Queenmother's authority. The dispute was referred to Otumfuo Osei Tutu II and the Asanteman Council, which upheld the Queenmother's customary right to nominate, affirmed the nominee's royal status, and ruled that invoking the Great Oath in such circumstances was reckless. Both parties were found guilty of reckless oath-taking and required to perform atonement rites. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, affirming the decisions of the lower courts and reinforcing the constitutional recognition of customary law in chieftaincy matters.",
