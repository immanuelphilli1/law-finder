  "caseTitle": "JOHN DOMINIC OWUSU V AKUA AKOMAH",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed the appeal in *John Dominic Owusu v Akua Akomah*, affirming the Court of Appeal's judgment. The plaintiff had claimed specific performance and declarations based on a 1987 written deed of assignment, which the trial court found was not executed by the defendant and was procured in fraud. The defendant counterclaimed, asserting an oral agreement from 1986 requiring full payment within three months, which the plaintiff failed to meet. The Supreme Court held that no valid contract existed for enforcement, as the written deed was void and the oral agreement was denied by the plaintiff. It emphasized that time was of the essence due to high inflation, making the plaintiff's delayed payment unacceptable. The Court also reaffirmed that specific performance, being an equitable remedy, requires clean hands, which the plaintiff lacked. It further stressed that courts must adjudicate only on issues raised in pleadings, and cannot speculate beyond them. Consequently, the trial court's order for specific performance was overturned.",
