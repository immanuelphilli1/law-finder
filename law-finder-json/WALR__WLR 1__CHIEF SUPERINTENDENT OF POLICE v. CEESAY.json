  "summary": "The appellant, Ceasay, was convicted by a magistrate of theft by a clerk or servant under sections 251 and 257 of the Criminal Code. On appeal, the Supreme Court of the Colony of the Gambia held that the conviction must be quashed because the magistrate failed to allow the accused an opportunity to present a defense, as required by section 169(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. Although this procedural irregularity was fatal to the conviction, it did not render the trial a nullity because the error would not have been apparent on the formal record of the trial—particularly if, as in England, the record did not include evidence. Since the appellant had been in jeopardy, the principle of autrefois convict barred a retrial. The appeal was allowed, the conviction quashed, the sentence set aside, and the appellant ordered to be released immediately.",
