  "caseTitle": "MISCELLANY-AT-LAW SEMINAR FOR CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES AND AN IN",
  "summary": "This document compiles lectures delivered at a 1987 judicial seminar for circuit court judges and newly appointed magistrates in Ghana. Chief Justice Sowah emphasizes that writing judgments is the most critical function of a judge, requiring clarity, brevity, and accuracy. He stresses the importance of mastering the English language, adopting a clear and effective writing style, and properly settling issues before trial to avoid irrelevant cross-examination. Judges are reminded to base findings on credible evidence, apply binding precedents correctly, and avoid verbosity. The document also includes illustrative personal injury awards from 1987–1988, showing how damages were calculated in fatal and non-fatal road accident cases.",
