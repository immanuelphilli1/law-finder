  "caseTitle": "MISCELLANY-AT-LAW APPOINTMENT OF SENIOR ADVOATES OF GHANA [1",
  "summary": "The 1987–1988 Review of Ghana Law documents the historic appointment of the first nine Senior Advocates of Ghana (SAG) by the General Council of the Ghana Bar Association in December 1988. The appointment, based on criteria including professional competence, integrity, and at least 15 years of legal practice, marked a milestone in the development of Ghana’s legal profession. The ceremony, held at the Ghana Law School on 23 December 1988 and attended by high-ranking judicial and government officials, featured speeches by Chief Justice E.N.P. Sowah and GBA President Bannerman-Williams. The Chief Justice emphasized the moral responsibilities of SAGs, particularly in advancing legal aid and mentoring young lawyers, cautioning against elitism. Notably, Mrs. Joyce A. Bamford-Addo became the first Ghanaian woman appointed as SAG, and Mr. Seth Y. Bimpong-Buta the first locally trained and youngest appointee.",
