  "summary": "In this appeal from a High Court conviction, the West African Court of Appeal considered whether the appellant's killing of Sambo during a clan affray amounted to murder or manslaughter. The incident occurred during a fight between the Ediene clan (deceased's clan) and the Minya clan (appellant's clan), where the Ediene clan was the aggressor. The appellant was wounded by an arrow and, after the deceased was felled by a machete, retaliated by inflicting a fatal wound. The trial judge convicted of murder, reasoning that the deceased personally did not provoke the appellant. The appellate court disagreed, holding that the provocation stemmed from the collective attack by the Ediene clan, of which the deceased was a part. Applying section 318 of the Criminal Code on provocation, the court found the appellant acted in the heat of passion and substituted a conviction for manslaughter. The death sentence was set aside and replaced with two years' imprisonment with hard labour.",
