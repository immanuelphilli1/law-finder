  "caseTitle": "NORTEY VERSUS DUNCAN.",
  "summary": "This consolidated land dispute before the High Court, Eastern Judicial Division, involved rival claims to Osu Stool land based on deeds of gift executed by individuals claiming authority as mankralo. The plaintiffs relied on deeds from Narh Yeboah, who styled himself as acting mankralo in 1949. The defendant's deed was executed in 1951 by Nii Nortey Afriyea II, recognized as the substantive mankralo following a 1948 Ga State Council decision that resolved a dual appointment dispute. The court held that Narh Yeboah's authority ceased after the valid enstoolment of Afriyea II in 1948, rendering the plaintiffs' deeds void. The court affirmed that while sub-stools (like the Mankralo Stool) manage and may grant determinable estates in stool land without superior stool concurrence, only a validly installed occupant can execute such grants. Superior stool consent cannot cure a defect in the grantor's authority. Even if the Osu Stool had consented to the plaintiffs' grants, such concurrence would be ineffective where the grantor lacked authority. The defendant's deed, executed by the duly recognized mankralo, was upheld as valid. The court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims, emphasizing the principle that only the rightful occupant of a stool can convey interests in stool land.",
