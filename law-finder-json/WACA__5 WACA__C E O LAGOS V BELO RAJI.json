  "caseTitle": "C E O LAGOS V BELO RAJI",
  "summary": "This appeal concerned a restrictive covenant in a lease stipulating that the land be used for 'residential purposes only.' The appellant, the Chairman of the Lagos Executive Development Board, alleged that the respondent, Belo Raji, breached this covenant by using part of the premises as a mosque. The trial judge dismissed the claim, finding that the use of the house for prayers by invited family and friends did not constitute a breach. The West Africa Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, holding that the trial judge misdirected himself on key factual issues: first, in asserting that residential use was clearly established despite evidence that the main hall was primarily used for prayers and sleeping arrangements were confined to two rooms; second, in concluding that only invitees attended, when evidence showed that any Muslim could attend and gatherings regularly included 30\u001340 people, with one instance of 200 attendees. The court emphasized that a mosque is simply a place of worship for Muslims, requiring no formal dedication or registration. Given the scale and nature of the use, the appellate court held that the property was being used substantially for non-residential purposes, constituting a breach of the covenant. The case was remitted for the defence to be heard or for re-hearing.",
