  "summary": "In this landmark decision by the Supreme Court of Ghana, the court addressed the enforcement of fundamental constitutional rights following a petition by Christiana Edith Agyakwa Aboah. The case centered on alleged violations of her right to fair hearing and freedom of expression by state actors. The Court held that the actions complained of were inconsistent with the 1992 Constitution, particularly Articles 12, 16, and 17, which protect human dignity, due process, and equality. The judgment reaffirmed the judiciary's role in upholding constitutionalism and provided remedies for the breach of fundamental rights. The decision underscores the importance of judicial review in maintaining the rule of law.",
