  "caseTitle": "MICHAEL PHARES v JOSEPH ABDALLAH",
  "summary": "The plaintiff, Michael Phares, sued the defendant, Joseph Abdallah, for �343 4s 6d, comprising a balance on a promissory note, interest, and expenses incurred on the defendant's behalf. The trial court awarded �186 on the note and interest, and �34 1s 4d on the third claim. The defendant appealed, later abandoning the appeal on the smaller sum. The grounds of appeal challenged the validity of the action post-indorsement, limitation, a prior receipt for �450, and sufficiency of evidence. The West Africa Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. It held that the defendant's 1936 letters admitting liability reset the limitation period, rendering the claim timely. The court also found that the onus of proving settlement lay with the defendant, who failed to discharge it, especially given the inconsistency of his later admissions with the claim of prior settlement. The appellate court upheld the trial court's factual findings and dismissed the appeal with costs.",
