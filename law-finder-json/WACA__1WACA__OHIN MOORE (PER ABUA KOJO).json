  "caseTitle": "OHIN MOORE (PER ABUA KOJO)",
  "summary": "This 1932 West African Court of Appeal decision from Ghana (then Gold Coast Colony) centered on whether an appeal could proceed when the appellant failed to pay court-ordered costs before obtaining leave to appeal. The Native Tribunal had ruled in favor of the defendant and ordered the plaintiff to pay costs. The plaintiff obtained leave to appeal without having paid those costs, contrary to section 77(2) of the Native Administration Ordinance. The Provincial Commissioner allowed the appeal after the costs were later paid, setting aside the Tribunal’s judgment. The West African Court of Appeal, by majority, held that non-compliance with the statutory precondition rendered the appeal a nullity, as leave granted without payment of costs was ultra vires. The appeal was upheld, the Provincial Commissioner’s judgment set aside, and the original Tribunal decision restored.",
