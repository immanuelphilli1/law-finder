  "caseTitle": "ABINABINA STOOL VERSUS NKASAWURA STOOL",
  "summary": "The case of Abinabina Stool v. Nkasawura Stool, heard by the West African Court of Appeal in 1956, involved a dispute over land title between two stools in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). The plaintiff sought a declaration of title and damages for trespass, asserting that their predecessors first occupied the land and granted it to the defendant's predecessors under a tribute agreement. The trial court dismissed the claim, finding insufficient evidence to support the plaintiff's traditional account and noting the defendant's long, undisputed possession. On appeal, the court upheld the decision, ruling that payment of tribute alone does not establish ownership and that the plaintiff failed to discharge the burden of proof. The court also rejected reliance on prior litigation not involving the defendant, holding it inadmissible for estoppel or proof of title. The judgment emphasized that a plaintiff must prove their own title, not rely on the defendant's weakness.",
