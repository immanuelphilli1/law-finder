  "caseTitle": "BINORTSOR VERSUS NORDOR",
  "summary": "In Binortsor v. Nordor, the plaintiff sought a declaration of title to land in a Native Court but failed to present oral evidence or witnesses, relying solely on written submissions and documents. The Native Court dismissed the claim, finding res judicata applied, a decision upheld by the Land Court. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, the plaintiff argued bias due to the Native Court president’s dual role as a State Council member with the defendant and claimed this inhibited his full presentation of the case. The Court of Appeal held that mere membership in the same council did not establish a real likelihood of bias under the nemo judex rule. It further ruled that the Land Court’s power under s. 50 of the Native Courts (Southern Ghana) Ordinance to order a retrial must be exercised judicially and only where there is material irregularity or miscarriage of justice, which was absent here. The appeal was dismissed.",
