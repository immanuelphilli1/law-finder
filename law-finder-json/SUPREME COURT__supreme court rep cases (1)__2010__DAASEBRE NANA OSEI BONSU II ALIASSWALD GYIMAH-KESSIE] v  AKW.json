  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana, in a judgment delivered on 24th February 2010, allowed the appeal brought by Akwasi Mensah, Ben Ephson, The Daily Dispatch, and Allied News Limited against Daasebre Nana Osei Bonsu II. The case arose from a 2003 article titled 'Mamponghene in 264 million cedis fraud,' which reported on a petition alleging the respondent received money for nominating a queen mother. The High Court had dismissed the libel claim, but the Court of Appeal reversed that decision, awarding damages. The Supreme Court reinstated the High Court’s judgment, holding that the publication constituted fair comment on a matter of public interest. The Court found that the appellants did not act maliciously and that the subject matter—concerning a traditional leader—was inherently of public concern. It emphasized that customary dispute resolution mechanisms, such as those led by the Asantehene, are valid and their proceedings may be reported. The appeal was deemed properly constituted despite a technical error in naming the court in the notice of appeal.",
