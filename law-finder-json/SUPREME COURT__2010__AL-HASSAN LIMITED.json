  "caseTitle": "REPUBLIC VRS HIGH",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed Al-Hassan Limited's application for certiorari and prohibition against a High Court judge's ruling that set aside its supplementary affidavit in an interlocutory injunction motion. The applicant argued that the ruling violated the rules of natural justice, particularly audi alteram partem and judicial bias. The Supreme Court held that both parties were heard before the decision was made, and the judge acted within his discretionary powers under the Civil Procedure Rules. The Court emphasized that mere erroneous judicial discretion, absent jurisdictional error or fundamental breach of natural justice, is not grounds for certiorari. The proper remedy for such grievances is appeal, not prerogative writs. The distinction between appeal and certiorari was reaffirmed as essential to judicial discipline, with supervisory jurisdiction exercised only in cases of fundamental legal error or clear bias.",
