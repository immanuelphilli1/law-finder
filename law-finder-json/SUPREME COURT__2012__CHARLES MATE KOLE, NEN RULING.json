  "caseTitle": "CHARLES MATE KOLE, NEN RULING",
  "summary": "In this 2012 ruling by the Supreme Court of Ghana, the court dismissed a motion by co-defendants for leave to file a counter-claim in a pending case. The presiding justice, Dr. Date-Bah, held that the application was filed too late, as the substantive case had already been adjourned for judgment. Additionally, the court found that the counter-claim—seeking a declaration on the proper interpretation of PNDC Law 26 and LI 1983 regarding the administrative delineation of Akuse—involved statutory rather than constitutional interpretation, and thus did not fall within the Court’s exclusive original jurisdiction. The dismissal was without prejudice, allowing the co-defendant to pursue the claim in a more appropriate legal forum.",
