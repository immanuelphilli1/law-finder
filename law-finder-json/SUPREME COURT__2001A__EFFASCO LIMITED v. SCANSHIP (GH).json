  "caseTitle": "EFFASCO LIMITED v. SCANSHIP (GH)",
  "summary": "In this Ghanaian Supreme Court case, Effasco Limited sued Scanship (Gh) Limited over the loss of cargo—two road rollers, grease, and brake fluid—during sea transit from Tilbury, UK, to Tema, Ghana. The cargo, properly packed and secured by the plaintiff's agents, was lost at sea despite the container arriving empty. The plaintiff won at both the High Court and Court of Appeal, with liability placed on the carrier’s agents for improper stowage and failure to secure the container on the ship's upper deck. The Supreme Court upheld the finding of negligence, rejecting the argument that insufficient packing caused the loss. Although the trial court wrongly excluded Exhibit M (a ship’s log), its exclusion did not cause a miscarriage of justice as it did not exonerate the carrier. The Court emphasized carriers' duty under the contract of carriage to properly and carefully stow and secure cargo, especially when aware of its nature and risks.",
