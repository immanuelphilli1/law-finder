  "summary": "This appeal arose from a civil action where Val Cap Marketing sued the Owners of M/V Vinta for $70,543.82 for fuel supplied. The defendants moved to dismiss, arguing no contract existed and the claim was statute-barred. The trial court dismissed the motion and entered judgment for Val Cap. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred in law by entering judgment at that stage. It found that Val Cap’s reply introduced a new case based on assignment of debt, inconsistent with the original claim of direct contractual liability. Since the trial judge considered matters outside the pleadings and failed to require proof of the alleged contract, the judgment was set aside. The appeal was allowed, and the case remitted for trial on the proper issues.",
