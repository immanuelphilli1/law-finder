  "summary": "In NTSIN v. Ekutey and Efah and Another, the plaintiff claimed damages for trespass on land known as 'Kuku', alleging that the defendants had encroached beyond a historically recognized boundary established in a 1918 native tribunal decision. The plaintiff tendered an uncertified copy of that decision, which the trial Native Court rejected due to inability to verify its authenticity after the original record book was destroyed by white ants. The plaintiff's oral evidence, including testimony from members of the old tribunal, failed to establish the boundary or any current or prior possession of the disputed area. The trial court found that the defendants had cultivated farms (cocoa, cassava, yam) on the land for 6–11 years, while the plaintiff had no presence there. On appeal, the High Court upheld the decision, affirming that the plaintiff failed to prove ownership or exclusive possession—essential elements for a trespass claim—and that the exclusion of the uncertified document was legally sound. The appeal was dismissed.",
