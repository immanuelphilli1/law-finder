  "summary": "This book review, published on 14 December 1982, evaluates 'Criminal Procedure in Ghana' by A. N. E. Amissah, a comprehensive legal treatise addressing the complexities of Ghana's criminal procedure law following numerous amendments to the 1960 Criminal Procedure Code (Act 30). The author, a retired Justice of Appeal and former Director of Public Prosecutions, systematically presents the law from the reporting of an offence through to trial, appeals, and reviews. The review highlights the book’s clarity, accuracy, and utility for legal professionals and scholars. It notes a significant omission: the lack of discussion on judicial review of military tribunals established under A.F.R.C. Decrees, particularly in light of constitutional transitional provisions such as section 15(2) of the 1979 Constitution. The reviewer also acknowledges Amissah’s impartial treatment of controversial judicial decisions, including his own in the Ohene-Djan murder trial, where he accepted a plea to manslaughter under section 239(2) of the Code, a move that sparked public and judicial debate.",
