  "caseTitle": "ALEXANDER ALEXANDER LOGIOS",
  "summary": "The appellant, Alexander Alexander Logios, claimed entitlement to a Certificate of Occupancy for a plot of land in Kano, Nigeria, based on a November 1935 letter from the Resident of Kano. However, the certificate was issued to Gaisers, a firm represented by Brettschneider, following negotiations facilitated by the appellant's solicitor, Mr. Oddie. Although an English solicitor for the appellant cabled a refusal to sell, Mr. Oddie asserted the sale had been completed. The Government acted on Oddie's representation, and the appellant failed to formally revoke Oddie's agency or inform the Government. The West Africa Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that the Government reasonably assumed Oddie had authority to act on the appellant’s behalf, and no legal interest preventing such agency was established.",
