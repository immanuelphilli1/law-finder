  "caseTitle": "J. T. OGUNSANYA AND SALAMI OBE v ARAB BROTHERS LIMITED",
  "summary": "In J.T. Ogunsanya and Salami Obe v Arab Brothers Limited, the West Africa Court of Appeal held that landlords could not lawfully evict tenants and demolish premises without a court order, even when complying with a Town Council abatement notice under the Townships Ordinance. Despite the premises being declared dangerous and subject to demolition, the Increase of Rent (Restriction) Ordinance (Cap. 93) required landlords to obtain a court order for ejectment. The court found the landlords liable for trespass, emphasizing that statutory protections for tenants override common law rights. Although the tenants failed to prove special damages, the court awarded 20 shillings in general damages to each appellant, recognizing a legal wrong. The appeal was allowed, and judgment was entered for the plaintiffs with costs.",
