  "caseTitle": "REGINA VERSUS GRUMAH.",
  "summary": "In Regina v. Grumah, the appellant was initially found unfit to plead due to mental illness but was later tried for murder after a psychiatrist deemed him fit. He admitted killing the deceased but claimed he acted under an insane delusion that the victim was about to kill him. The trial judge failed to adequately distinguish between self-defence and the defence of insane delusion in his jury instructions. The West African Court of Appeal held that an insane delusion—defined as a false, unshakable belief caused by mental disease—could negate criminal responsibility under section 52(2) of the Criminal Code, c. 9 of 1951. Given the lack of proper direction to the jury, the court substituted the verdict of guilty with a special verdict of 'guilty but insane' under section 137 of the Criminal Procedure Code, c. 10 of 1951, and ordered the appellant detained at the Accra Mental Hospital during Her Majesty's pleasure.",
