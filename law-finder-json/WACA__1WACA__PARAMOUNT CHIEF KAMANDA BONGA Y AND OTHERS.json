  "caseTitle": "PARAMOUNT CHIEF KAMANDA BONGA Y AND OTHERS",
  "summary": "This 1931 West African Court of Appeal decision addresses an application for leave to appeal filed by Paramount Chief Kamanda Bongay and others more than three months after the lower court's final judgment. The central issue was whether the Court could entertain a late application beyond the three-month period under Rule 10, given that it was filed within six months. The Court held that Rule 11 explicitly permits applications to the appellate court within six months without requiring special justification, rejecting the argument that such late applications should be treated as requests for 'special leave.' The Court emphasized the plain language of the rules and found a rational basis for the time distinction in Ordinance No. 9 of 1929, which limits certain appeals (e.g., on costs or by consent) to the lower court within three months. However, the applicants were not immediately granted leave because their supporting affidavit failed to clearly establish that the claim exceeded the statutory threshold of fifty pounds in value. The Court ruled that a supplementary affidavit must be filed to confirm jurisdictional requirements before conditional leave to appeal could be finalized.",
