  "caseTitle": "SEMINAR ON THE TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS THE ROLE OF PAROLE IN",
  "summary": "This 1989–90 seminar paper by Justice Danyagre J.S. examines the role of parole in Ghana's criminal justice system, advocating for community-based corrections as a humane, effective, and fiscally responsible alternative to prolonged incarceration. Drawing on the British parole model, the paper outlines that prisoners serving determinate sentences become eligible for parole after one-third of their sentence or six months, whichever is later. Parole is not a right but a privilege granted based on good conduct, rehabilitation potential, and risk assessment. The process involves a Local Review Committee and the Parole Board, which advises the Secretary of State (Interior Minister). Conditions of parole include reporting to probation officers, maintaining employment, and obtaining permission for travel. Violation can lead to recall. The paper emphasizes that long-term imprisonment may worsen criminal behavior, citing research showing lower recidivism among early releases. It critiques Ghana's prison overcrowding, largely due to non-violent offenses like theft, and calls for reform through expanded use of parole to reduce systemic strain and promote reintegration.",
