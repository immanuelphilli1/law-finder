Even though the judge entered summary judgment for only a part of the amount admitted with the unadmitted part to be proved by evidence, as far as the admitted portion was concerned there was finality with the order and nothing else to be done save execution!

  "summary": "In this Ghanaian civil case, the Supreme Court considered the finality of a summary judgment granted by the trial judge, Ofori Atta J, on an admitted portion of a claim. The court emphasized that once a summary judgment is entered on an admitted debt, it attains finality and is enforceable by execution, with no further judicial action required on that part. The unadmitted portion, however, must still be proven through evidence. The decision draws on precedent, particularly the reasoning of Hardiman J in the Alte Leipzeger case, to affirm that partial summary judgments can have final effect on the issues they resolve, reinforcing procedural efficiency in civil litigation.",
