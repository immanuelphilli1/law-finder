  "caseTitle": "REPUBLIC v. THE JUDICIAL COMMITTEE OF THE GA TRADITIONAL",
  "summary": "This appeal arose from a High Court ruling granting certiorari to quash a decision by the Judicial Committee of the Ga Traditional Council, which had determined a chieftaincy dispute based solely on affidavits without hearing oral evidence. The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's decision, holding that the Committee's failure to take viva voce evidence—especially on the contested issue of locus standi—constituted a fundamental breach of natural justice and customary law principles. The court emphasized that while traditional tribunals may follow customary procedures, they must ensure fair hearing and proper evaluation of evidence, particularly where affidavits disclose triable issues. The adoption of affidavit-based adjudication, akin to formal court procedures, necessitates compliance with evidentiary standards, including cross-examination. The appeal was dismissed, affirming that the High Court rightly intervened to correct a manifest procedural error.",
