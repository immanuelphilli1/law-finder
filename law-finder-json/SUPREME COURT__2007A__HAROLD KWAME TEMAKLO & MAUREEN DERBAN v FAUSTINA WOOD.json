  "summary": "In this Ghanaian property dispute, the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal's decision reversing the High Court's grant of ownership to Faustina Wood, the mother of the deceased Sylvia Garshong. The property at issue was purchased in Sylvia's name and remained registered under her name until after her death. The Plaintiffs, Sylvia's children, sought a declaration that the property devolved to them under the Intestate Succession Law, PNDCL 111, and an order compelling the co-administratrix (Madam Wood) to execute a vesting assent. The High Court had ruled in favor of Madam Wood, accepting her claim that she financed the purchase. However, the Court of Appeal reversed this, finding that the legal presumption under NRCD 323, s 35—that the legal owner is also the beneficial owner—had not been rebutted. The Supreme Court affirmed this, holding that the Defendant failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove on a balance of probabilities that she was the true purchaser. The trial judge's reliance on speculation about Sylvia's financial capacity was deemed inadequate to overcome the statutory presumption. Thus, the property rightfully belonged to Sylvia's estate and devolved to her children.",
