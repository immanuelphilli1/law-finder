  "caseTitle": "REX v JOHN ONI AKERELE 2",
  "summary": "In REX v John Oni Akerele, the West Africa Court of Appeal allowed an appeal against sentence for manslaughter. The appellant had been sentenced to three years' imprisonment with hard labour following conviction for the manslaughter of a child, Kalu Ibe, due to gross carelessness in administering a drug mixture. The Court upheld the conviction but found the sentence excessive, noting the absence of deliberate intent to harm or break the law. It emphasized that the prosecution's case rested on a single act of criminal negligence. Consequently, the original sentence was quashed and replaced with a fine of £500 or twelve months' imprisonment in default. The concurrent sentence on a separate count under section 343(1)(i) of the Criminal Code was quashed under section 16 of the Code. The appellant was granted one month to pay the fine and allowed bail under a bond of £1,000 with two sureties of £500 each.",
