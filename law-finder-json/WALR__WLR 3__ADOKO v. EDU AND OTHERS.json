  "caseTitle": "ADOKO VERSUS EDU",
  "summary": "The Senior Supi of the No. 3 Asafo Company of Mankessim, Kwesi Adoko, brought a case before the Mankessim State Council against Kobina Edu and others for refusing to participate in traditional functions and local administration. The State Council issued a writ under the State Councils (Southern Ghana) Ordinance, 1952, prompting Edu to seek a prohibition order in the High Court, arguing lack of jurisdiction. Ollennu J. held that the State Council's use of statutory powers to compel attendance under section 5(3) of the Ordinance is only valid when exercising jurisdiction over 'matters of a constitutional nature' as defined in section 2. Since the dispute concerned participation in traditional activities and not chiefly elections, depositions, stool property, or political relations, it did not fall within that definition. Therefore, the State Council lacked jurisdiction, and the High Court issued an order of prohibition. The court noted obiter that State Councils may possess inherent customary jurisdiction beyond the Ordinance, but such jurisdiction must be exercised without invoking statutory enforcement mechanisms.",
