  "summary": "This case involved an application for conditional leave to appeal to the Privy Council from a judgment of the West Africa Court of Appeal (WACA) dated 7th March, 1940. The Co-Plaintiff-Appellant argued that the judgment was final and thus entitled them to appeal as of right under Rule 3(a) of the West African (Appeal to Privy Council) Order-in-Council, 1930. The WACA held that the judgment was interlocutory, not final, because it did not finally dispose of the matter in dispute and left the suit pending in the lower court. Applying the test from Salman v. Warner, the court emphasized that a final judgment must conclusively determine the litigation. The court also referenced McDonald v. Belcher, noting that the trial judge had not made a final finding on the issue of rents and profits from Himan lands. The application for leave to appeal was dismissed with costs.",
