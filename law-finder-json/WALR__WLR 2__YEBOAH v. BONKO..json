  "caseTitle": "YEBOAH VERSUS BONKO.",
  "summary": "In Yeboah v. Bonko, the plaintiff sought a declaration that she was the rightful successor to the estate of Adjua Penfua and an order annulling the appointment of Kwabina Sarfu by the Yoko family. The central issues were whether the plaintiff and the deceased were maternal cousins and whether the deceased, whose mother may have been a former slave, was a member of the Yoko family under native law. The Native Court found the plaintiff's claim of kinship unproven and upheld the family's appointment. On appeal, it was argued that the defendant's representation by a linguist who also gave evidence rendered the proceedings void. The Supreme Court of the Gold Coast held that the linguist was properly authorized under s.22 of the Native Courts (Colony) Ordinance, and while his testimony was inadmissible, it did not invalidate the proceedings given corroborative evidence. The court affirmed that the deceased’s mother, though possibly formerly enslaved, had become a recognized family member, entitling the family to appoint a successor per custom. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the validity of the customary succession process.",
