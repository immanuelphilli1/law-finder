  "caseTitle": "DIVISIONAL CHIEF GBOGBOLULU",
  "summary": "This appeal before the West African Court of Appeal arose from a land dispute between two traditional stools in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). The Divisional Chief of Vakpo, suing in representative capacity for his stool, obtained judgment in the Magistrate's Court against the Head Chief of Anfoega, also representing his stool. The Deputy Commissioner overturned the decision on the technical ground that the writ did not explicitly state the representative capacities of the parties. The appellate court held that courts must prioritize substantial justice over procedural technicalities, particularly where parties are unrepresented. It ruled that the representative nature of the suit was evident from the proceedings and that the writ could be formally amended to reflect this without prejudice. The court restored the Magistrate's judgment, which upheld the Gruner boundary as the correct demarcation, a position consistent with the defendant's own counterclaim. No valid alternative ground for appeal was presented.",
