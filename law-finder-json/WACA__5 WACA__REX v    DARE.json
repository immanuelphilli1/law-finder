  "summary": "This 1939 West African Court of Appeal decision addressed whether a minor, Musa, given as a pawn in exchange for a debt, could be considered an accomplice in a slave-dealing charge under section 369(3) of the Criminal Code. The court held that Musa, as the victim of the offence and not a participant in the criminal intent, could not be deemed an accomplice. The ruling clarified that a person for whose protection a law is enacted cannot simultaneously be an accomplice to the same offence. The court distinguished its earlier decision in Rex v. Sanni LadiPo, noting that the issue of pawning was not fully contested, and emphasized that one cannot be convicted of a crime committed upon oneself. The case was remitted to the trial court for judgment consistent with this ruling.",
