  "caseTitle": "AWULAE ATTIBRUKUSU III",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case involved a land dispute between Awulae Attibrukusu III, the Omanhene of Lower Axim Traditional Area, and members of the Ewoku Nvaviley Family. The plaintiff claimed allodial title over 15 square miles of land and sought recovery of possession, damages for trespass, and an injunction against the defendants, as well as the setting aside of a 1984 Statutory Declaration made by the predecessor of the first defendant. The High Court dismissed the claim, recognizing the defendants' possessory or usufructuary interest coexisting with the plaintiff's allodial title. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, finding that the defendants had denied the plaintiff's allodial title by ceasing tribute payments and alienating portions of the land, thus warranting forfeiture. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision, ruling that the defendants’ conduct—particularly the refusal to pay tribute and unauthorized alienation of land—constituted a denial of allegiance, justifying forfeiture subject to due inquiry. The court stressed the importance of customary obligations in maintaining possessory rights under customary law.",
