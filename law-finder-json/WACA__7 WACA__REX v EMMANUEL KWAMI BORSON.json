  "caseTitle": "REX v EMMANUEL KWAMI BORSON",
  "summary": "In Rex v Emmanuel Kwami Borson, the West Africa Court of Appeal allowed an appeal against a conviction for perjury under section 359 of the Criminal Code. The appellant had made a sworn statement before a public officer, declaring he acquired land through ancestral allocation and built a structure without family assistance—statements alleged to be false. However, the court held that the oath was a 'voluntary oath' administered outside any judicial inquiry or official proceeding, which is expressly prohibited under section 13 of the Imperial Statutory Declarations Act 1835 as applied in the Gold Coast. Since the administration and taking of the oath were unlawful, the oath was deemed legally invalid. Consequently, the foundation for the perjury charge was destroyed. The court allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and sentence, and entered a verdict of acquittal. The Crown, through the Acting Solicitor-General, did not oppose the appeal on this point of law.",
