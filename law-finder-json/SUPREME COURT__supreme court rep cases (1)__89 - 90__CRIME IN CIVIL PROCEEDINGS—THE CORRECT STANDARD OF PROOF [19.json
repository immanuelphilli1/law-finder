  "caseTitle": "In the case of Ampadu v. Dankwah1",
  "summary": "This legal commentary examines the correct standard of proof required in civil proceedings where allegations of criminal conduct, particularly fraud, are made, with a focus on Ghanaian jurisprudence. The author critiques the decision in Ampadu v. Dankwah, where the court applied a higher standard of proof—akin to the criminal standard—for fraud, contrary to established principles in England and Australia. The article reviews key authorities including Hornal v Neuberger Products Ltd and Briginshaw v Briginshaw, which affirm that while the balance of probabilities remains the standard in civil cases, the seriousness of the allegation demands a more rigorous evaluation of evidence. The commentary concludes that Ghanaian courts should align with international best practice by applying the civil standard with heightened scrutiny rather than requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt or 'criminal deception' in civil fraud cases.",
