  "caseTitle": "ENUM VERSUS SHAMA STATE",
  "summary": "In this 1957 High Court decision, Kofi Enum, headman of the Aboadzi fishing community, applied for a writ of prohibition to prevent the Shama State Council from hearing destoolment charges brought by members of his community. The court held that under the State Councils (Southern Ghana) Ordinance, c. 8 of 1952, State Councils have jurisdiction only over constitutional matters relating to chiefs, and since a headman is not considered a chief under the Ordinance, his destoolment does not constitute a constitutional matter. The court emphasized that the State Council's role is limited to confirming or rejecting a headman appointed by the village, not initiating or adjudicating destoolment proceedings. As the Council was acting beyond its statutory authority, the application for prohibition was granted. The ruling reaffirmed the principle that native judicial bodies must operate within the limits of conferred jurisdiction.",
