  "caseTitle": "GEORGE A. LARBI v. S.S.N.I.T.",
  "summary": "This is a civil appeal before the Ghana Court of Appeal concerning the termination of George A. Larbi by SSNIT. The appellant challenged the dismissal on grounds including improper constitution of the disciplinary committee, lack of authority in the termination letter, and inadmissibility of the rules of service (Exhibit 2). The trial court dismissed his claim for declaration, reinstatement, and damages. On appeal, the court upheld the trial judge's discretion in allowing amendment of pleadings to include Exhibit 2, finding no manifest injustice. It held that objections to the document's authenticity, lack of seal, or stamp duty were not raised during trial and thus could not be raised on appeal. The court also rejected an estoppel argument, noting it was not pleaded. Ultimately, the appeal was dismissed, affirming that procedural irregularities did not invalidate the termination where substantive rights were protected and no miscarriage of justice occurred.",
