  "caseTitle": "M. ELKALI AND ANOTHER",
  "summary": "This was a civil appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal concerning a claim for specific performance or, alternatively, damages for breach of a contract to lease a shop in Ibadan. The plaintiffs relied on an unregistered written agreement (Exhibit 'A') which was admitted by the trial court but challenged on appeal as inadmissible under section 15 of the Land Registration Ordinance, 1924, for failing to register an instrument affecting land. The appellate court held that the agreement constituted an 'instrument' within the meaning of the Ordinance and should have been rejected due to non-registration. Additionally, the court found that the claim for specific performance was barred under section 3A of the Native Lands Acquisition Ordinance, which requires the Governor's written approval for alien land transactions—approval that was neither obtained nor sought. Although the defendant may have had a duty not to obstruct approval, no such breach was alleged or proven, so the damages claim also failed. The appeal was allowed, the judgment below was set aside, and the plaintiffs' claim was dismissed with costs awarded to the appellant.",
