  "caseTitle": "REX v A. E. OFON I",
  "summary": "The appellant, A. E. Ofon I, was the manager of the Asaba branch of the United Africa Co. Ltd., responsible for cash, stock, and accounting. He was convicted on ten counts including stealing, obtaining money by false pretences, and fraudulent false accounting under the Criminal Code. The West Africa Court of Appeal upheld most convictions but quashed those on count 1 (stealing a general deficiency of \u0001304 19s. 11d.) and count 10 (stealing \u000114 9s. 2d. from Onochie). The court held that a general cash shortage without proof of specific misappropriation was insufficient for conviction under s.390(6). Additionally, the conviction for stealing from Onochie was inconsistent with the conviction for false accounting regarding the same transaction involving \u000133 9s. 2d., of which \u000114 9s. 2d. was a part. The appellant's false assertion that he had paid the palm oil owners was deemed evidence of intent to defraud, supporting the false pretences conviction. The appeal was allowed on counts 1 and 10, resulting in acquittals; the remaining eight convictions were upheld.",
