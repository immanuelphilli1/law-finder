  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC v. THE HIGH COURT, ACCRA, MRS GRACE SARFO & 2 O",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case involved an application for certiorari to quash an interim injunction order issued by the High Court in a dispute over the administration of the estate of the late Kofi Safo. The High Court had appointed the Chief Registrar as Manager and Receiver of a property and directed the company (Lims Company Ltd., allegedly 100% owned by the deceased) to submit financial reports and cease commercial activities. The Supreme Court held that a company has a separate legal personality from its shareholders under Salomon v. Salomon, and thus the High Court exceeded its jurisdiction by interfering with the internal management of the company, which rests with its directors. Although the issue of share ownership was disputed, the court emphasized that the administrators of the estate hold shares in trust but do not gain managerial authority. However, as the applicants had already obtained a variation of the contested order—restoring directorial control with court supervision—the Supreme Court found the matter effectively resolved and dismissed the application as moot.",
