  "caseTitle": "REX v OBI BEKUM AND THREE OTHERS",
  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of Obi Bekum, quashing his conviction for the murder of an unknown Munchi man. The trial was found fundamentally flawed due to the improper joinder of three murder charges, including two identical counts for murdering 'an unknown Munchi man,' which violated Nigeria's Criminal Procedure Ordinance that prohibits joining any other charge with a murder charge. This joinder created confusion and prejudiced the defense, as it was unclear which victim the appellant was convicted of murdering. Additionally, the court found no sufficient corroboration of the accomplice witness's testimony regarding the deaths of the two Munchi men. The trial judge incorrectly relied on vague statements and misattributed evidence of one body to confirm the death of another, unsupported by direct or circumstantial proof of the Munchi men's deaths. Both grounds independently warranted overturning the conviction.",
