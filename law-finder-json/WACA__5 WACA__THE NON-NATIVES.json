  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF THE NON-NATIVES INCOME TAX (PROTECTORATE) ORDINANCE, 1931, AND IN THE MATTER OF THE ASSESSMENT OF INCOME TAX PAYABLE BY BISHOP BERTRAM LASBREY",
  "summary": "This West African Court of Appeal decision interprets section 4(1) of the Non-Natives Income Tax (Protectorate) Ordinance, 1931, holding that income derived from employment in Nigeria but neither received in nor derived from Nigeria (such as a bishop’s leave salary paid from funds subscribed in England) is not assessable for income tax. The court affirmed the trial judge’s ruling, emphasizing that 'derived from Nigeria' cannot be judicially expanded to include income merely linked to Nigerian employment. The decision underscores the importance of strict statutory interpretation and limits on tax jurisdiction, distinguishing the case from Potters v Commissioner of Income Tax. The court declined to extend the ordinance’s reach absent clear legislative language.",
