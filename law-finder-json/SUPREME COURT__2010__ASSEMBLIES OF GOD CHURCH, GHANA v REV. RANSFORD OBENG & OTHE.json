  "caseTitle": "ASSEMBLIES OF GOD CHURCH, GHANA v REV. RANSFORD OBENG & OTHE",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana resolved a protracted ecclesiastical dispute between the Assemblies of God Church, Ghana (plaintiff) and Rev. Ransford Obeng & others (defendants), who led the Calvary Charismatic Centre (CCC) in seceding from the denomination in 1992. The core issue was ownership of church property following the unilateral cessation of affiliation. The plaintiffs sought declarations affirming their ownership of the CCC's properties, recovery of possession, and injunctions against interference. The High Court (2001) and Court of Appeal (2005) ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, affirming that church properties were held in trust by the national body under the church's constitution. The Supreme Court upheld these decisions, emphasizing that while individuals have the right to secede, property rights remain with the denominational body unless otherwise provided. A partial exception was recognized for Plot No. 12, Atimpongya, where joint investment created co-ownership between CCC and CCM. The judgment underscored the spiritual incongruity of litigation among religious leaders while affirming the legal supremacy of constitutional church governance.",
