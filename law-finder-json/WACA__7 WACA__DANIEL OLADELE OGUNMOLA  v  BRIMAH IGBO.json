  "caseTitle": "DANIEL OLADELE OGUNMOLA v BRIMAH IGBO",
  "summary": "This 1941 West African Court of Appeal decision involved an appeal by Daniel Oladele Ogunmola against Brimah Igbo, where conditional leave to appeal required a bond of twenty-five guineas to secure costs. The appellant filed a bond for twenty-five pounds instead, leading to non-compliance with the condition. The court held that such non-compliance was fatal, rendering the appeal not properly before the court. However, citing the Privy Council's decision in Kojo Pon v. Atta Fua, the court emphasized the importance of substantial justice and noted that technical defects should not bar appeals where procedural rules allow flexibility. The appeal was struck out without prejudice to the appellant's right to perfect the appeal, and the respondent was awarded seven guineas in costs.",
