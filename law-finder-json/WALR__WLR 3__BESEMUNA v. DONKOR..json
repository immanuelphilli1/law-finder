  "caseTitle": "BESEMUNA VERSUS DONKOR.",
  "summary": "This case involved a dispute between the Ohene (paramount chief) of Krachi and the Mankralo, who accused the Ohene of violating the Great Oath of the state. The Mankralo condemned the Ohene in his absence, slaughtered two sheep, and sent him the thighs as a symbol of guilt, but did not follow customary procedure by sending chiefs or linguists to summon him to a tribunal. The Ohene sued in the Buem-Krachi Native Court for violation of custom, won, and the Mankralo appealed up to the High Court. The High Court held that although the parties held constitutional roles, the dispute was a personal wrong under native law and not a constitutional matter under s. 14A of the Native Courts (Southern Togoland) Ordinance. It affirmed the Native Court's jurisdiction and upheld its factual findings, emphasizing that Native Courts are custodians of custom and their decisions should not be overturned unless unsupported by evidence or contrary to natural justice, equity, or good conscience.",
