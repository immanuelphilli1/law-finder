  "caseTitle": "PRACTICE NOTE",
  "summary": "In this 1956 practice note from the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast, Ashanti Division, Land Court in Kumasi, Manyo-Plange J. held that applications for extension of time to appeal from Native Courts to the Supreme Court must be made on notice rather than ex parte. Relying on the principles in Evennett v. Lawrence (1876) and Absi v. Mends (1935), the judge emphasized that the respondent must be given the opportunity to be heard and to object, ensuring procedural fairness. This procedural requirement underscores the importance of due process even in administrative aspects of appellate practice.",
