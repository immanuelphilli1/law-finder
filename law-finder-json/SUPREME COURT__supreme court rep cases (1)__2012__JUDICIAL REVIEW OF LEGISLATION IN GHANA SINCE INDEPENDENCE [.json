  "caseTitle": "JUDICIAL REVIEW OF LEGISLATION IN GHANA SINCE INDEPENDENCE [",
  "summary": "This article examines the development of judicial review in Ghana since independence, situating it within broader constitutional theory. It traces judicial review from its colonial roots—where the British Privy Council exercised oversight over colonial laws—to its entrenchment in Ghana's 1957 Independence Constitution. Under that Constitution, the Supreme Court was granted exclusive original jurisdiction to determine the validity of laws, marking a centralized model akin to West Germany’s constitutional court. The article highlights the case of Lardan v. Attorney-General (No. 2), where Parliament passed a law retroactively terminating court proceedings challenging a deportation order, raising constitutional concerns. The author analyzes judicial review as a mechanism to uphold constitutional supremacy, protect fundamental rights, and maintain the rule of law, while acknowledging debates over its democratic legitimacy. Drawing on Marbury v. Madison, the piece underscores the judiciary’s role in enforcing higher legal norms against legislative overreach.",
