  "summary": "The appellant, Adebiyi Majekodunmi, a solicitor, was convicted alongside two Post Office employees for conspiring to tamper with postal matter, specifically to backdate a letter under Section 576 of the Criminal Code. He appealed on three grounds: (1) that as a non-employee, he could not conspire to commit an offence under Section 163, which applies only to postal workers; (2) that the deposition of a government witness, Eric Parr, and associated exhibits were improperly admitted; and (3) that the verdict was unreasonable due to insufficient evidence. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that a person can be liable for conspiracy even if they cannot personally commit the substantive offence, citing established legal principles. It further ruled that the deposition was properly admitted under Sections 34 and 114 of the Evidence Ordinance, as the witness's absence was justified by the Gazette and procedural safeguards were followed. However, the court found that the circumstantial evidence did not exclusively point to guilt, and due to conflicts and discrepancies in the prosecution's case, the conviction could not stand. The appeal was allowed, and the conviction quashed.",
