  "summary": "In Bilson v. Apaloo (1981), the Ghanaian Supreme Court addressed the limits of criticism directed at the judiciary. While affirming the right to fair and good faith criticism of judicial decisions as part of freedom of speech, the Court condemned scurrilous or malicious statements that scandalize the court or impute bias and improper motives to judges. The case arose after the plaintiff made public statements and held a press conference alleging judicial impropriety prior to the hearing. The Court emphasized that while reasoned and informed criticism is legitimate and beneficial in a democracy, unfounded attacks undermine public confidence in the administration of justice. Citing article 114(6) of the 1979 Constitution, the Court affirmed its authority to punish contempt and warned that it would not hesitate to do so in future cases. The judgment endorses Lord Denning's principle that judges must endure criticism but cannot reply, relying instead on their conduct for vindication.",
