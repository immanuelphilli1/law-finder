  "caseTitle": "DAATSIN VERSUS AMISSAH",
  "summary": "In this 1958 High Court decision, the plaintiff, Kwaw Daatsin (head of the Kumah branch of the Anona family), sued Chief Sam Amissah (head of another branch) to recover a debt of �28 allegedly owed by the deceased 'Uncle Sam' to the deceased Kwesi Asafuah. The court held that under prevailing native customary law, the family of a deceased person is not liable for their debts, particularly where the debtor left no estate. The action could not be maintained against the head of the debtor's family. Additionally, the court ruled that the plaintiff lacked locus standi because the right to enforce the debt passed to the matrilineal family of the deceased creditor, not the plaintiff's family branch. The court affirmed that a head of family suing in a representative capacity is personally liable for costs if awarded against them, citing Hammond v. United Africa Co. This decision marks a shift from older customs of collective family liability, rejecting such principles as relics of slavery inconsistent with justice and equity.",
