  "caseTitle": "FOREST PRODUCTS LTD & ORS v. GENERAL DEVELOPMENT CO.",
  "summary": "The Court of Appeal in Ghana upheld an interim preservation order issued by the High Court for equipment and vehicles subject to four consolidated suits between Rad Forest Products Ltd. and General Development Co. Ltd. The High Court had appointed its Deputy Registrar as Receiver/Manager under Order 50, Rules 5 and 7 of the Civil Procedure Rules, 1954 (L.N. 140A), allowing hire use with fees paid into court. The appellants sought a stay of execution, arguing legal error in the appointment of a receiver. The Court of Appeal held that the preservation order was justified given the plaintiffs' prima facie ownership claim, the risk of asset depreciation, and the balance of convenience. It found the receiver's appointment incidental to preservation and not an overreach, noting that the defendants would not suffer irreparable harm as hire payments were safeguarded. The application for stay was therefore rejected.",
