  "caseTitle": "LEGAL CONTROL OF RENTS OF PREMISES IN URBAN AREAS OF GHANA L",
  "summary": "This academic article analyzes the legal control of rents in urban Ghana, focusing on the evolution and impact of rent regulation laws, particularly the Rent Act, 1963 (Act 220). It situates rent control within the broader context of rapid urbanization, population growth, and severe housing shortages in cities like Accra and Kumasi. The article highlights that over 60% of households in Accra live in rented accommodation, mostly owned by private individuals, with limited public sector involvement due to inefficiencies. The Rent Act, 1963 introduced a system where rent officers assess 'recoverable rent' based on factors such as rateable value, repair costs, and market conditions, ensuring judicial fairness in disputes. The law also criminalizes overcharging, excessive rent advances, and 'goodwill' payments. Despite these measures, enforcement challenges persist amid high demand and insufficient housing supply. The article concludes that rent control has served an egalitarian purpose by protecting low-income urban tenants, though structural issues in housing production and finance remain unresolved.",
