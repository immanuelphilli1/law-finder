  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana, exercising its supervisory jurisdiction under Article 132 of the 1992 Constitution, granted an order of certiorari to quash a High Court ruling of 29 March 2011 that had committed Dr. Ernest Asiedu Osafu Alex Aboagye to prison for contempt of court. The contempt order was based on the applicant's failure to comply with a prior judgment of 26 January 2009, which the Supreme Court found to be fundamentally flawed. That earlier judgment, entered in default under Order 13 rule 6(2) of CI 47, included a declaratory order made without affording the defendant an opportunity to be heard, thereby violating the constitutional right to fair hearing under Article 14(1) and the principles of natural justice (audi alteram partem). The Supreme Court held that such a breach renders the proceedings a nullity, and since the contempt order depended on this defective judgment, it could not stand. The Court emphasized that violations of fundamental rights, especially the right to be heard, cannot be remedied under procedural rules like Order 81 of CI 47 and necessitate supervisory intervention.",
