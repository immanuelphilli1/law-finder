  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION UNDER ARTICLE 33 OF THE CONSTITUTION 1992 A N D IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION BY DANIEL AWUNI PER HIS NEXT FRIEND",
  "summary": "This constitutional appeal arose from the West African Examinations Council's (WAEC) decision to cancel the SSSCE results of 13 students from Notre Dame Minor Seminary and impose a three-year examination ban for alleged foreknowledge and collusion in Mathematics (Core) Paper 2. The students, through their next friend, challenged the decision in the High Court, arguing it violated their fundamental rights under Articles 23 and 33(1) of the 1992 Constitution. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on procedural grounds, but the Supreme Court allowed it, holding that WAEC's failure to afford the students an opportunity to be heard before imposing punitive measures breached the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness enshrined in the Constitution. The court emphasized that decisions affecting educational rights must follow fair procedures, and the use of an originating notice of motion was valid under Article 33 for enforcing fundamental rights. The sanctions were set aside due to lack of due process.",
