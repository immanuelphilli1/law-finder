  "caseTitle": "Rex v. Oliphant",
  "summary": "Joseph Attoh Ahumah Quaye, an accounts manager at the United Africa Company Limited's Nsawam branch, was convicted of falsifying accounts under section 283(1) of the Criminal Code. The West Africa Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, finding that Quaye instructed a clerk, Ofori, to make a false entry in the stores transfer book showing kerosene was taken for watchmen's expenses when it was for his personal use, with intent to defraud. The false entry was replicated in ledger No.2 and a true entry omitted from ledger No.8. The court held that falsification committed through an innocent agent constitutes criminal liability for the directing party. Evidence of other transactions was admissible to prove intent. The appeal was dismissed, following Rex v. Oliphant, confirming that directing a false entry or omission through another satisfies the statutory offence.",
