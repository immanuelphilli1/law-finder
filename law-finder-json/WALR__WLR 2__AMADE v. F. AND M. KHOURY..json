  "caseTitle": "AMADE VERSUS F.",
  "summary": "In this 1956 Gold Coast Supreme Court case, the plaintiff (Amade) entered into a hire-purchase agreement with the defendants (F. and M. Khoury) for a lorry. The defendants lawfully seized the vehicle in December 1954 due to a £20 arrear in payments. Although the plaintiff later paid the £20, the court held he was not entitled to repossession because the agreement lacked a redemption clause allowing reinstatement upon payment of arrears. Additionally, two collateral agreements—evidenced by receipts for repairs and spare parts worth £380 15s. 6d.—remained unpaid, and their inclusion effectively extended the hire-purchase obligations. The court dismissed the plaintiff's claim for return of the lorry or damages and entered judgment for the defendants on their counterclaim for the outstanding amounts.",

    "Payment of the £20 arrear did not discharge the full obligation due to unpaid collateral agreements.",
    "The receipts for repairs and spares constituted binding collateral agreements extending the original contract.",
