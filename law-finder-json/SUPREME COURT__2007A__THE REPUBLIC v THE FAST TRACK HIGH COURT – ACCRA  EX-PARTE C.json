  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC VRS THE FAST TRACK HIGH COURT",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana addressed whether a complaint under Article 218(a) of the 1992 Constitution, enabling CHRAJ to investigate human rights violations, corruption, and abuse of power, must be made by an identifiable individual or entity and formally lodged. The Court held that such a complaint must be traceable to a specific source—either an individual or corporate body—and formally submitted to CHRAJ, either orally or in writing, in accordance with C.I. 7. The Court rejected the notion that public expressions of dissatisfaction, such as media reports, suffice as complaints. It emphasized a literal interpretation of 'complaint' as a formal accusation requiring procedural compliance, distinguishing investigations under Article 218(a) from those under 218(e), which do not require a complainant but are limited to corruption and misappropriation of public funds.",
