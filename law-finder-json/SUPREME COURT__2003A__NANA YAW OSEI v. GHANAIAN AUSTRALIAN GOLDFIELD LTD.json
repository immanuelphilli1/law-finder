  "caseTitle": "NANA YAW OSEI v. GHANAIAN AUSTRALIAN GOLDFIELD LTD",
  "summary": "The appellant, Nana Yaw Osei, a mine operator at Ghanaian Australian Goldfield Ltd. (GAG), was retired on medical grounds after being diagnosed with a cardiac disease. He claimed the illness was occupational under Article 11.09(c) of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), seeking 20 months' salary. The High Court initially ruled in his favor, awarding �12 million, but the Court of Appeal reversed the decision, finding no causal link between his illness and his job. The Supreme Court upheld the appellate ruling, holding that the medical evidence (Exhibits C and E) only indicated the timing of symptom onset during employment, not causation. The Court emphasized that an appellant cannot raise new factual issues on appeal and that the burden of proving occupational illness lay with the appellant, which he failed to meet.",
