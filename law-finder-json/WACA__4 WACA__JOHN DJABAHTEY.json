  "summary": "This case involved a civil dispute between John Djabahthey (plaintiff-respondent) and Benkumhene Antwi Awua II, representing himself and the Stool of Begoro (defendant-appellant), concerning a land transaction governed by native customary law. The plaintiff claimed 500 pounds in damages for breach of an implied contractual term to provide undisturbed possession of 255 native ropes of land at Odedeso, which he had purchased for 2,550 pounds. The defendant counterclaimed for 1,090 pounds as the unpaid balance of the purchase price, asserting that full possession would only be granted upon full payment per native custom. The trial judge dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction, holding it was a land matter under native law. On appeal, the West African Court of Appeal upheld the dismissal. Kingdon, C.J. (with Petrides, C.J.), held that the suit related to land possession and thus fell under the exclusive jurisdiction of the paramount chief's tribunal per section 48(2)(c) of Cap. 76, requiring referral under section 65. The court rejected the argument that it was merely a personal contract claim, emphasizing that the core issue—undisturbed possession—directly implicated land rights. Webb, C.J., dissented. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the referral to the appropriate native tribunal.",
