  "summary": "This is a civil appeal before the Court of Appeal of Ghana, arising from a High Court judgment that set aside a consent judgment in Suit No. E2/59/2006 involving the 'SCOA Building' in Takoradi. The respondents, administrators of the estate of the late Halifax Addo-Twum, claimed ownership of part of the building based on his alleged contribution of half the purchase price when the appellant church (Resurrection Power & Living Bread Ministries International) acquired it from SCOA Ghana Ltd. in 1994. The appellant had obtained a consent judgment against S.G.S. Ltd., the tenant, without notifying the respondents. The respondents then sued to set aside that judgment on grounds of fraud and were granted relief, including a declaration of title not originally claimed. The Court of Appeal found that the trial judge erred in law by amending the writ and counterclaim sua sponte at the judgment stage, contrary to Order 16 of C.I. 47, and that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of fraud. The court also held that the trial judge misapplied the principle in Lamptey v. Hammond and failed to give adequate consideration to the appellant's case. As a result, the appeal was allowed, and the High Court’s judgment was set aside.",
