  "caseTitle": "BANNERMAN QUIST & 1 OR v. MICHAEL AGBOTUI SOUSSOUDIS",
  "summary": "This appeal arose from a landlord-tenant dispute where the plaintiffs, Mrs. Bannerman Quist and another, sought a 100% increase in rent from the defendant, Michael Agbotui Soussoudis, who had been a statutory tenant since the original agreement expired in 1995. The trial court awarded rent of ₵6 million per annum retroactively from 1995, without following the statutory rent assessment process under the Rent Act, 1963 (Act 220). The Court of Appeal held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to assess rent, as such power is vested in Rent Officers or the Minister under Sections 10 and 11 of Act 220. The appellate court set aside the rent increase but upheld the plaintiff's right to recover rent at the previous rate of ₵3 million per annum until the tenant vacated in May 1999. The court also rejected the appellant’s claim that the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction over the monetary amount, citing WOOD VS. DADSON (1976) 2 G.L.R. 185, which affirms that inferior courts have full jurisdiction in landlord-tenant matters regardless of claim size. Allegations of judicial bias due to premature filing of plaintiffs’ address were dismissed as baseless, given that the document referenced testimony from a witness who testified after the alleged filing date. Finally, the defendant’s counter-claim for costs to rebuild a collapsed fence wall was denied because he acted without the landlord’s consent, despite prior notice.",
