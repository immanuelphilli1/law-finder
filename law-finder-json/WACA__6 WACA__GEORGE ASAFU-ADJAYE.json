  "caseTitle": "GEORGE ASAFU-ADJAYE",
  "summary": "This was an appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal concerning a claim for commission on cash sales by George Asafu-Adjaye, the plaintiff-appellant, against John Holt & Company (Liverpool) Limited. The appellant argued he was entitled to commission on all cash sales from the company's wholesale store upon Store Requisition Orders, based on Clause 13 of the agreement. The Court held that the agreement only entitled him to commission on cash sales made by him with the express approval of the company's agent, which he failed to prove except for one transaction already compensated. Additionally, the Court found that by signing the commission account as correct on 30th September 1938, the appellant had accepted its accuracy and could not later dispute the calculation, except for a minor correction of 10s. 10d. versus 4s. 1d. The appeal was dismissed with costs of £23 15s. 6d. The Court emphasized the importance of trial judges recording findings of fact and reasons for decisions, even briefly, to aid appellate review.",
