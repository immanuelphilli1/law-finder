  "caseTitle": "HARRIET O. ILORI AND OTHERS v CHIEF AKINLOLD OLOTO",
  "summary": "This West African Court of Appeal decision concerned a claim by Harriet O. Ilori and others to set aside the sale of land at Ebute Metta, originally part of a 1868 grant for Egba refugees. The land had been attached under a writ of fieri facias and sold at public auction as property of the Oloto family. The plaintiffs' father was not shown to hold a 'Glover Ticket' or formal title, but the family had occupied the land for nearly eighty years without challenge. The court, citing Akpan Awo v. Cookey Gam, held that it would be inequitable to disturb such long and undisturbed possession, even in the absence of formal documentation or established tenure. The appeal was dismissed with costs, affirming that equitable principles protect longstanding occupants against enforcement sales where title has not been previously contested.",
