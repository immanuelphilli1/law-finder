  "caseTitle": "ASHIE NEEQUAYE v ADEE KOTEY",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana upheld the lower courts' rulings in a property dispute between the family of Moses Neequaye and Clifford Cudjoe. The plaintiff, having obtained Letters of Administration for Moses Neequaye's estate, sought declarations that Plot 218 in East Christianborg was originally allocated to Moses and that Clifford Cudjoe held it in trust. The defendant argued res judicata, lack of capacity, and statute-barred claims. The Court held that the prior dismissal for lack of capacity did not bar relitigation once capacity was acquired, that the defendant lacked locus standi to challenge the plaintiff's representative capacity concerning Dina Neequaye's estate, and that the claim was not statute-barred as no adverse claim arose during Moses Neequaye's lifetime. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the plaintiff's right to pursue the claim.",
