  "caseTitle": "SUBAR VERSUS SAGNIA.",
  "summary": "In this 1956 appeal before the Supreme Court of the Colony of the Gambia, the court upheld a divorce granted by the Cadi of Kanifing to a wife on the grounds of her husband's cruelty. The wife had refused further sexual intercourse after four acts in one night, prompting the husband to beat her violently, causing bleeding and excretion on her clothing. The court accepted her testimony and corroborating witness evidence, including physical proof. The husband admitted the beating and injury. Citing Russell's Mohammedan Law of Marriage, the court held that a single act of cruelty by a husband is sufficient grounds for a wife to repudiate the marriage, even without a history of abuse. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
