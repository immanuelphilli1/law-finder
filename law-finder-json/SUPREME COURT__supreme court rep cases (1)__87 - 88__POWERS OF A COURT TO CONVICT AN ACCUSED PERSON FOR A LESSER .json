  "caseTitle": "POWERS OF A COURT TO CONVICT AN ACCUSED PERSON FOR A LESSER",
  "summary": "This legal analysis examines the scope and application of section 154 of Ghana's Criminal Procedure Code, 1960 (Act 30), which permits a court to convict an accused person of a lesser or included offence even when not specifically charged, provided the facts support it. The discussion centers on whether such convictions are permissible under principles of fair trial, legal certainty, and absence of surprise. The article reviews historical precedents from Ghana and Nigeria, including decisions by the West African Court of Appeal, and analyzes the Court of Appeal of Ghana’s ruling in *Sarimbe alias Olala v The Republic*, where it upheld a conviction for assault on a murder charge under section 154. It argues that the provision must be narrowly interpreted to preserve the accused's right to prepare a defense and avoid unfairness, emphasizing that the lesser offence must be inherently included within the charged offence. The analysis also questions whether appellate courts can invoke this power sua sponte.",
