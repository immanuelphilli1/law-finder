  "caseTitle": "COMPTROLLER OF CUSTOMS AND EXCISE VERSUS AKAM AND OTHERS.",
  "summary": "The Comptroller of Customs and Excise sought certiorari or mandamus to compel a magistrate to order forfeiture of a lorry used to transport smuggled cigarettes. The magistrate had refused forfeiture on equity grounds, believing he had discretion under s.232 of the Customs Ordinance. The Supreme Court held that when ss.203 and 232 are read together, the word 'may' in s.232 must be interpreted as 'must', making forfeiture mandatory. However, the court refused both remedies: mandamus was inappropriate because the magistrate had exercised jurisdiction, and certiorari did not lie because the error was a mere misinterpretation of law within jurisdiction, not an excess of it. The applicant should have appealed instead. The lorry was ordered released.",
