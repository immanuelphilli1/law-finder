  "summary": "This document compiles a keynote address by Chief Justice Sowah E N P on 'The Art of Writing Judgments' delivered at a 1987 seminar for circuit court judges, alongside a list of recent personal injury awards. The Chief Justice emphasizes that judgment writing is the most critical judicial function, requiring clarity, brevity, and accuracy. He stresses the importance of mastering the English language, adopting a clear and effective writing style, and properly settling issues before trial to avoid irrelevant cross-examination. He underscores the binding nature of precedent under stare decisis and the necessity of applying law correctly to factual findings. The document also includes illustrative personal injury awards from 1987–1988, showing detailed breakdowns for fatal and non-fatal road accident cases, reflecting considerations of age, dependency, earnings, and non-pecuniary damages.",
