  "summary": "This case involved a claim for damages for trespass to land and an injunction, raising the issue of whether the High Court had original jurisdiction under section 9(b) of the Protectorate Courts Ordinance, 1933. The West Africa Court of Appeal was asked to interpret the phrase 'title to land or any interest therein.' The court held that the phrase means 'title to land or as to the title to any interest therein, i.e., in land,' affirming that suits raising issues about title to any interest in land are excluded from the High Court's original jurisdiction where the matter falls within native court jurisdiction. The court relied on the ordinary meaning of the words and drew an analogy to the English case Rex v French (1902) 1 K.B. 637, which supported this interpretation. The appeal was resolved by affirming the proper scope of jurisdiction, and costs were awarded to the defendants.",

  "rationaleHighlights": [
    "The phrase 'title to land or any interest therein' must be interpreted as 'title to land or title to any interest in land'.",
    "The ordinary meaning of the words supports the interpretation that issues about interests in land fall under the jurisdictional bar.",
    "The English case Rex v French (1902) supports this construction by analogy.",
    "The court rejected the alternative interpretation that 'interest therein' refers to interest in the title to land."
  ],
  "confidenceNotes": "The interpretation is based on a clear judicial analogy to an English precedent and unambiguous statutory language. The court explicitly rejects one interpretation in favor of the other.",
