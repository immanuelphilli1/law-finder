  "summary": "In Woyome and Others v. Agbomasu and Others, the High Court of the Eastern Judicial Division, Land Court, addressed whether a decision on a plea of res judicata constitutes a final or interlocutory order in Native Courts under the Native Courts (Southern Ghana) Procedure Regulations, 1945. The Native Court had dismissed the plea of res judicata and granted an interim injunction, prompting the defendants to appeal to the Magistrate’s Court, which reversed the decision and held the claim was res judicata. The Native Court adopted this ruling without independent review. The High Court held that a decision on res judicata is a final order, not interlocutory, and thus the Magistrate’s Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal under s. 52(2) of the Native Courts (Southern Ghana) Ordinance. The Magistrate’s judgment was declared null and void for want of jurisdiction. The Native Court’s adoption of that decision without re-evaluating the plea independently was also invalid. The appeal was allowed, the judgment and order on res judicata were set aside, and the case was remitted for a de novo hearing before a different panel.",
