  "summary": "In this 2002 Court of Appeal decision from Ghana, the appellant, Kwashie Opei (substituted by Nai Kofi Parbi), challenged the validity of a 70-year lease agreement with Atwere River Estates over 600 acres of family land in the Awutu Traditional Area. The appellant claimed the lease was only for 10 years and was obtained by fraud and unconscionability, particularly due to non-disclosure of the full term and unilateral insertion of rent terms. The trial court dismissed the counterclaim, upheld the lease, awarded damages, and ordered renegotiation of rent through an umpire. The Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court’s findings, holding that the respondent discharged the burden of proving the illiterate appellant understood the document, as it was properly read and interpreted in Twi and Ga. The court found the appellant’s evidence uncorroborated and insufficient to overturn the lease, rejecting claims of fraud and non est factum. The damages and equitable intervention were upheld as lawful and reasonable.",
