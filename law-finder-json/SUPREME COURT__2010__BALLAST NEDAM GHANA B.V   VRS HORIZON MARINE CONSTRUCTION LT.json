  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision, delivered on 28th July 2010, concerned a civil appeal (Civil Appeal No. J4/18/2010) arising from the reversal of a High Court order granting summary judgment to Ballast Nedam Ghana B.V. against Horizon Marine Construction Ltd. The Court of Appeal had found triable issues in the defendant's affidavit, particularly regarding whether the plaintiff had fulfilled contractual specifications under clause 4 of their agreement, which was a condition precedent to payment. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision, holding that the defendant had raised a bona fide defence by disputing the quality of work and rejecting invoices, thus creating a genuine issue that warranted a full trial. The Court emphasized that summary judgment under Order 14 of CI 47 should not be granted where there is a fair probability of a defence, especially in technically complex contracts. It criticized the High Court for failing to inquire further under Order 14 rule 3(2) despite special circumstances. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the necessity of a trial to determine compliance and liability.",
