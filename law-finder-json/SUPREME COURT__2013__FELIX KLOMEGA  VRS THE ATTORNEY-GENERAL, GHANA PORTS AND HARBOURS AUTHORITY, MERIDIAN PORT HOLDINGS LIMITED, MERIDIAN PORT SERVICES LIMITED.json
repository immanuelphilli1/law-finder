  "summary": "In this 2013 Supreme Court of Ghana ruling, the plaintiff, Felix Klomega, a citizen and taxpayer, sought declarations that the Shareholder Agreement and Concession Agreement between the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority (GPHA) and Meridian Port entities constituted international economic transactions requiring parliamentary approval under Article 181 of the 1992 Constitution. He argued that GPHA, as a state entity, fell within the definition of 'Government' under the Constitution, and thus the failure to seek parliamentary approval rendered the agreements null and void. The second to fourth defendants raised a preliminary objection, claiming the Court lacked jurisdiction due to the non-ambiguity of the term 'Government' as defined in Article 295. However, the Supreme Court, per Dr. Date-Bah J.S.C., rejected the objection, holding that the case raised genuine issues of constitutional interpretation regarding the scope of 'Government' and the application of Article 181 to state corporations in international transactions. The Court emphasized that the contextual and functional characteristics of GPHA—such as presidential appointment of officials, public funding, and accountability to Parliament—supported its inclusion under Article 181. The ruling affirmed the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction in such matters and allowed the case to proceed on merits.",
