  "caseTitle": "REGINA VERSUS OSABU",
  "summary": "The appellants, Osabu and Maaseyo, were jointly convicted of murder based solely on circumstantial evidence and their cross-incriminatory statements. The prosecution's case against Maaseyo (the second appellant) was weak, and her voluntary statement actually explained away suspicious circumstances. Despite this, the trial judge wrongly rejected her 'no case' submission. This led her to testify and adopt her statement, which in turn seriously incriminated Osabu. The Court of Appeal held that where there is no evidence to support a 'no case' submission, its rejection is a legal error, and subsequent evidence cannot cure the defect. As Maaseyo's statement should not have been admitted, and its use prejudiced Osabu, both convictions were unsafe. The court emphasized the importance of proper prosecutorial strategy in joint trials.",
