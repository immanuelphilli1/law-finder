  "caseTitle": "BUOR VERSUS BEEDE",
  "summary": "In Buor v. Beede and Others, the plaintiff sought to redeem a plot of stool land pledged by his predecessor to the first defendant. The key issue was whether the original transaction was a pledge or an outright sale, and whether alienation of a determinable estate in stool land to a stranger without stool consent rendered the transaction void ab initio or merely voidable. The High Court, per Ollennu J., held that the transaction was a pledge, not a sale, based on witness testimony and customary law. Even if it had been a sale, such alienation without consent would be voidable at the suit of the stool, not void from inception. The court rejected estoppel by acquiescence, finding the stool unaware of any infringement of its rights despite 30 years of occupation, and no evidence of improvements by the defendants. The appeal was dismissed, upholding the Native Court’s decision in favor of the plaintiff.",
