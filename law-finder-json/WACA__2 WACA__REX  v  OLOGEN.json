{
  "caseTitle": "REX v OLOGEN",
  "summary": "This is an appeal from a conviction for perjury under section 118 of the Criminal Code, where the appellant, Ologen, swore an information alleging that one Iyashere wounded him with a matchet during a disturbance at Jesse on 21st January 1935. Evidence showed that Iyashere was in Warri at the time, making the allegation false. The Assistant Judge convicted the appellant, finding he knowingly made a false statement. On appeal, the West Africa Court of Appeal held that it is not their function to retry the case based on notes of evidence or to overturn a verdict merely due to doubt. Since the trial judge could reasonably infer the appellant knew the information was false, the conviction was upheld. The appeal was dismissed.",
