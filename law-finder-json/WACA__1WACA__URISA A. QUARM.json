  "caseTitle": "URISA A. QUARM",
  "summary": "This appeal before the West African Court of Appeal involved a land sale dispute concerning stool land in Dutch Sekondi, Ghana. The plaintiff-appellant, Urisa A. Quarm, paid £400 for a plot via a deed allegedly executed by the Stool of Dutch Sekondi, Kwesi Miyewden (an occupant with equity), and others. When Quarm sought possession, Miyewden denied involvement, and a prior judgment found the transaction fraudulent due to forged signatures. Quarm then sued the current Omanhene (Chief) representing the Stool and Ephraim, a key figure in the sale, to recover the purchase money. The trial judge dismissed the claim, wrongly framing it as improperly pleaded. The appellate court reversed, holding that the Stool, as a corporation sole, is liable for acts of its agents acting within authority. The court ruled that a deed is sufficiently executed by the Chief and the Linguist, and the plaintiff, a bona fide purchaser, was entitled to recover the money upon total failure of consideration. The fraud must be imputed to the Stool, as the other parties were innocent. The claim for 'money had and received' was valid, and the Stool could not evade liability by alleging internal fraud by its agents.",
