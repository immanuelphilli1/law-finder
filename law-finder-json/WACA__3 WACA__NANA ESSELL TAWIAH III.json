  "caseTitle": "NANA ESSELL TAWIAH III",
  "summary": "This 1936 West Africa Court of Appeal decision involved a land boundary dispute between Nana Essell Tawiah III and Kwesi Ewudzi, originating in the Paramount Chief's Tribunal of Gomoa Assin. The Provincial Commissioner had allowed the defendant's appeal, reversing the Tribunal's decision. The Court of Appeal held that although the Provincial Commissioner had jurisdiction due to conditional leave granted by the Tribunal, the original Tribunal proceedings were a nullity because key members who delivered judgment were not present throughout the hearing. Citing the principle that native tribunals' land decisions should not be overturned without clear error, the Court set aside both the Tribunal’s and Provincial Commissioner’s judgments and ordered a de novo retrial. The appellant was awarded costs in both appellate and lower courts, with Tribunal costs to abide the final outcome.",
