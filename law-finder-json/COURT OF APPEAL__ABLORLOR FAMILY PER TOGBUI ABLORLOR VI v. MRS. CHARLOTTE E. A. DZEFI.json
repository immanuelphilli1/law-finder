  "summary": "The Court of Appeal in Ablorlor Family v. Mrs. Charlotte E. A. Dzefi (CA No. 5/98, 26 October 2000) overturned a lower court's judgment that declared the Ablorlor Family as sole owners of Nyametso land and voided a land sale by the Amoah family. The appellate court held that the land was jointly owned by three families—Ablorlor, Kodje, and Tengkpo—based on a 1936 Native Tribunal decision. It ruled that alienation of such land requires consent from all three families' heads and principal members; thus, a sale by only one family (Amoah) was invalid. However, the plaintiff lacked capacity to sue alone, as he did not seek to protect jointly held family property under the exceptions in Kwan v. Nyieni, nor had he consulted the other co-owning families. The trial court erred by granting reliefs not pleaded and by substituting the plaintiff’s claim of exclusive ownership with a joint ownership finding. Consequently, the appeal was allowed, and the judgment for the plaintiff was set aside.",
