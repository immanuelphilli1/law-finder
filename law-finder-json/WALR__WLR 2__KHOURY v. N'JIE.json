  "caseTitle": "KHOURY VERSUS N'JIE.",
  "summary": "In Khoury v. N'Jie, the plaintiff sued to recover \u0001295 as the outstanding balance from a \u000118,000 property sale conducted under a sealed agreement. The defendant argued that an oral agreement in October 1953 varied the original contract, whereby the plaintiff agreed to forgo \u0001295 in exchange for early payment of \u00011,000 and rent-free occupation until completion. The Chief Justice found in favor of the defendant, holding that early payment constituted valid consideration for the variation, and that despite common law rules, equity permits oral variation of a sealed contract under the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925. The plaintiff's conduct, including not offsetting the debt against later rent, supported the finding of full satisfaction. Judgment was entered for the defendant with costs.",

    "A contract under seal can be varied by an oral agreement, as equity allows such variation post-Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925, s. 44.",
    "The defendant's witnesses, including the plaintiff's uncle, were credible and supported the variation claim.",
    "The plaintiff's failure to set off the alleged debt against rent paid later supports the finding of full satisfaction.",
    "The written memorandum allowing rent-free occupation was unnecessary if no variation occurred, thus supporting the defendant's case."
