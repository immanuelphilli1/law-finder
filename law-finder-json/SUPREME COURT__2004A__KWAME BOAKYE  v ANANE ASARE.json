  "caseTitle": "KWAME BOAKYE v ANANE ASARE",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision from 2004 concerns a land dispute between Kwame Boakye (Appellant) and Anane Asare (Respondent). The Appellant's predecessor had initially won in the District Court, but the High Court reversed the decision. While an appeal to the Court of Appeal was pending, the parties allegedly reached an out-of-court compromise and agreed to withdraw the appeal. However, the Appellant proceeded with the appeal in the Respondent's absence and obtained a favorable judgment. The Respondent then sued to set aside that judgment on grounds of fraud, which the High Court dismissed, but the Court of Appeal reversed, finding fraudulent conduct. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision, ruling that the Appellant’s failure to disclose the compromise constituted fraud, even if not directly on the court, and affirmed that such judgments can be set aside.",
