  "caseTitle": "DORIS NAADU NARTEY v CHRISTIAN KUMI",
  "summary": "In this civil appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana, the defendant/appellant, Christian Kumi, challenged the lower court's refusal to set aside a judgment entered in favor of the plaintiff/respondent, Doris Naadu Nartey, concerning the ownership and distribution of a property bequeathed under the will of their late father, Christian William Kumi. The plaintiff sought a declaration of equal shares, judicial sale, and an injunction against alienation of House No. W.39 Boi Man at Abeka. The High Court entered judgment for the plaintiff after a de novo hearing in the defendant's absence, despite claims of non-service of hearing notice. The Supreme Court found that there was no evidence of service or substituted service of the hearing notice as required by law, constituting a breach of the rule of natural justice, audi alteram partem. Consequently, the Supreme Court held that the trial judge ought to have set aside the judgment and remitted the matter for a fair hearing.",
