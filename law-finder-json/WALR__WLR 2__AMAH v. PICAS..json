  "caseTitle": "AMAH VERSUS PICAS.",
  "summary": "In this 1956 decision by the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the court held that a landlord could recover the difference between a contractual rent and a higher standard rent assessed by the Rent Assessment Committee under the Rent Control Ordinance, c. 2 of 1952, even during the term of an existing lease. The plaintiff landlord had leased property to the defendant for 15 years at 20 per month. In 1952, the Rent Assessment Committee reassessed the standard rent at 45 per month from October 1, 1952. The defendant initially paid the increased amount but later refused, arguing the lease terms capped rent at 20. The court rejected this, ruling that Section 5(3)(a) of the Ordinance made the standard rent binding 'notwithstanding any lease to the contrary,' distinguishing Ghana's law from English rent restriction statutes which only set maximum limits. The claim for 405 in arrears was granted.",
