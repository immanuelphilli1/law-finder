  "caseTitle": "COMMISSIONER OF POLICE VERSUS DWAMINA.",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of the Gold Coast upheld the conviction of the appellant, Dwamina, for obtaining money by false pretences under section 293 of the Criminal Code. The appellant falsely represented himself as a building contractor needing funds to buy diamonds for resale, thereby inducing Amegbe to lend him £300. The court held that the intent to defraud was established by the false statements made knowingly, regardless of any intention to repay. The court also ruled that Amegbe was not an accomplice (particeps criminis) as he did not participate in the offence, and thus his uncorroborated testimony could be relied upon. The appeal was dismissed.",
