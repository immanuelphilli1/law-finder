  "summary": "This 1940 West Africa Court of Appeal decision addressed a land dispute transferred from the State Council to the Divisional Court in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). The court held that the State Council lacked jurisdiction under Section 48 of the Native Administration Ordinance, which vested original jurisdiction in the Paramount Chief's Tribunal. However, the Provincial Commissioner validly transferred the case under Section 75, enabling the Divisional Court to exercise its statutory jurisdiction under Section 14 of the Courts Ordinance, despite Section 17 restricting such exercise. The appeal was dismissed with a directive that the lower court must fully apply Schedule III Order 26, allowing necessary amendments to pleadings to reflect the true nature of the claim, even if altering the capacity in which parties sue. The court overruled the obiter dictum in Malm v. Wulff that had restricted such amendments, affirming that court rules must prevail.",
