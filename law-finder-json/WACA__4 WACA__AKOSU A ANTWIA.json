  "caseTitle": "AKOSU A ANTWIA",
  "summary": "In this civil appeal before the West African Court of Appeal, Akosu A Antwia, representing herself and her family, challenged the dismissal of her claim for a share of monies from Asuom Stool lands. The Native Tribunal had dismissed the claim due to lack of evidence showing her family's entitlement as stool heirs. The Provincial Commissioner allowed the appeal but failed to assess damages or remit the case for assessment. The WACA held that the Provincial Commissioner's judgment was unsatisfactory and reinstated the Native Tribunal's decision, finding no error in its factual conclusions. The appeal was dismissed, costs were awarded to the appellants in both appellate courts.",
