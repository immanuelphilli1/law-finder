  "caseTitle": "LEGAL CONTROL OF RENTS OF PREMISES IN URBAN AREAS OF GHANA L",
  "summary": "This academic article analyzes the legal framework for rent control in urban Ghana, focusing on the Rent Act, 1963 (Act 220) as the central legislative instrument. It situates rent control within the broader context of rapid urbanization, population growth, and a severe housing deficit, where over 60% of households in cities like Accra live in rented accommodation. The article explains that Act 220 controls rents by establishing a system where rent officers assess 'recoverable rent' based on factors such as rateable value, repair costs, and market comparables, ensuring a fair and judicial process. The law also enhances tenant security by limiting eviction to specific statutory grounds. Despite these measures, challenges persist due to weak enforcement, circumvention of advance rent rules, and the dominance of private landlords. The article concludes that while rent control serves an important social policy function—particularly in protecting the urban poor—its effectiveness is constrained by structural housing deficits and underdeveloped housing finance mechanisms.",
