  "caseTitle": "PETER OSEI ASSIBEY v ADEHYEMAN GARDENS LTD & OR",
  "summary": "In this civil appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana, Peter Osei Assibey, a subscriber to the regulations of Adehyeman Gardens Ltd., claimed to be a fully paid-up shareholder holding 20% of the company's shares and sought declarations affirming his status, challenging demands for additional payment, and restraining exclusion from the company. The High Court dismissed his claims, ruling he failed to prove full payment for his shares. On appeal, the key issue was whether Assibey was a fully paid-up member and director. The Supreme Court examined evidence including Exhibits 1, Q, R, and 3, noting that the managing director unilaterally appointed new directors without shareholder approval, violating Sections 181 and 272 of the Companies Code and Regulation 59. Despite being a subscriber, the court upheld the trial court’s finding that Assibey did not discharge the burden of proof to establish full payment for shares. The appeal was dismissed, affirming that subscription alone does not confer full shareholder rights without financial fulfillment.",
