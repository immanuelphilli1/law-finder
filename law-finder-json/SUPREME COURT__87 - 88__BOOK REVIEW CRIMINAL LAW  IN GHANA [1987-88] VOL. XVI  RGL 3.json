  "summary": "The document is a book review of 'Criminal Law in Ghana' authored by Mr. Justice Twumasi and published in 1985 by the Ghana Publishing Corporation. The review, published in 1987–88 in the Review of Ghana Law, highlights the significance of the textbook as the first comprehensive work on substantive criminal law in Ghana since the establishment of the Ghana School of Law. The book systematically covers 24 chapters on criminal law topics, including treason, murder, insanity, theft, bigamy, contempt of court, criminal libel, corruption, economic crimes, and lesser-discussed offences like trial by ordeal and motor vehicle violations. It contextualizes Ghana’s Criminal Code (Act 29) with local case law and supplements with English and Commonwealth jurisprudence where local precedents are lacking. Despite delays in publication that excluded more recent cases, the work is praised as a foundational and monumental contribution to Ghanaian criminal jurisprudence, intended for judges, legal practitioners, law students, law enforcement, and scholars.",
