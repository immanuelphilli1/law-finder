  "caseTitle": "COMMISSIONER OF POLICE v ANTHONY ARBAN",
  "summary": "The appellant, Anthony Arban, was convicted in a lower court for unlawful possession of diamonds under section 11(3) of Cap. 130, following the discovery of diamonds among shoe boxes in his shop. He claimed no knowledge of their presence, and the prosecution acknowledged that anyone entering the shop could have placed them there. The West Africa Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, holding that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had constructive possession of the diamonds, which requires evidence of knowledge or consent. The court emphasized that while section 11(3) shifts the burden to the accused to prove lawful possession, the prosecution must first establish possession conclusively. Citing *Obiase* and *Rex v. Schmna*, the court ruled that the facts were equally consistent with innocence and thus did not support the conviction. The conviction and sentence were quashed, and an acquittal was entered.",
