  "caseTitle": "MISCELLANY-AT-LAW LEGAL ASPECT OF BLOOD TEST EVIDENCE [1987-",
  "summary": "This 1987–1988 legal analysis by Osew E. O. examines the tension in Ghanaian law between the legal presumption of paternity under customary law and the use of scientific blood test evidence in paternity disputes. The article highlights jurisdictional limitations in lower courts, as seen in R v Accra New Town District Court; Ex parte Papafio, and discusses Section 32 of the Evidence Decree, 1975 (NRCD 323), which presumes a child born during marriage is that of the husband, while Section 97 allows bodily examinations and sample collection when necessary for justice. The author reviews cases like Nyarko v Mansu [1967] GLR 523, where courts upheld presumption despite consent for testing, and compares Ghana’s position with the UK’s Family Law Reform Act 1969, which permits court-ordered blood tests. The piece concludes that Ghana needs comprehensive legislation to resolve the conflict between tradition and science in paternity determinations.",
