  "caseTitle": "GODSON OKLEY & ANOR v. NUNGUA STOOL & 3 ORS",
  "summary": "This Court of Appeal decision in Ghana addresses whether a trial court retains jurisdiction to vary a consent judgment after it has been entered. The plaintiffs had obtained an ex parte and subsequent on-notice injunction to restrain the fourth defendant from excavating land, citing the defendant's non-compliance with settlement terms. The Court held that once a consent judgment is entered, the trial court becomes functus officio and cannot re-open or vary the judgment without a fresh action. Reliance was placed on Order 42, rule 2 of the High Court Rules (L.N. 140A) and authorities such as Guardian Assurance Co. Ltd v. Bridi, emphasizing that breach of a condition in a consent judgment does not empower a party to seek enforcement or variation through application in the original suit, but requires initiating a new action to set aside the judgment. The appeal was allowed on the ground that the trial court erred in law by assuming jurisdiction to vary the consent judgment.",
