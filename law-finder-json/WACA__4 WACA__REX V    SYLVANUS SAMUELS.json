  "caseTitle": "REX V SYLVANUS SAMUELS",
  "summary": "This appeal from a murder conviction centered on procedural irregularity during a court-ordered view of the crime scene. The West African Court of Appeal quashed the conviction because the accused, Sylvanus Samuels, was absent when the court, jury, prosecution, defence counsel, and two witnesses visited the locus in quo. During this visit, a prosecution witness was questioned on key aspects of the crime scene, and the Chief Justice demonstrated how the prosecution's theory about a forced lock was implausible. The court held that these actions transformed the 'view' into part of the trial, which must be conducted in the accused’s presence under the principles established in Lawrence v. The King. Despite the trial judge's presence, the failure to include the accused during evidentiary activity constituted a disregard of legal process. The appellate court concluded that this irregularity may have affected the jury’s decision and amounted to a miscarriage of justice. As a result, the conviction and sentence were set aside, and an acquittal was entered.",
