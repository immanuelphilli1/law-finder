  "summary": "In ADOBEA AND OTHERS v. LASSEY, the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast addressed a dispute over the customary pledge and redemption of land. The plaintiffs, sisters whose father had built a house on rented land, sought to recover possession after their guardian pledged the house to the defendant to raise funds. The court held that there was no presumption of fraud in the pledge, and the defendant owed no fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs. It affirmed the customary right of the pledgor to redeem the property at any time, allowing the plaintiffs to redeem upon payment of the original pledged sums. However, the court ruled that once a court order for redemption is issued, the customary right merges into the judgment, and failure to redeem within the stipulated time extinguishes the right. The appeal was allowed, lower court decisions were set aside, and a new judgment was entered with specific terms for redemption, rent, and possession.",
