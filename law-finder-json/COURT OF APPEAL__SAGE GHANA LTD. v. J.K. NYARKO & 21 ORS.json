  "caseTitle": "GHANA LTD. v. J.K. NYARKO & 21 ORS.",
  "summary": "The Court of Appeal of Ghana reviewed a High Court decision in favor of 22 former casual employees of SAGE Ghana Ltd. who were terminated on 29 February 2000. The plaintiffs claimed damages for the company's failure to convert them to permanent status as required by a collective agreement under the Industrial Relations Act, 1965 (Act 229), and for underpayment upon redundancy. The trial court awarded GHS 15 million each in damages. On appeal, the Court upheld the breach of contract finding but revised the damages to reflect actual years of service: GHS 14 million for those with 10+ years, GHS 10 million for 5–10 years, GHS 5 million for 1–5 years, and GHS 2 million for 132 days to 1 year. The court also awarded interest from 28 June 2000 to judgment date at prevailing bank rates, then statutory rates thereafter. It dismissed the defendant’s preliminary objection on late filing, finding actual notice of appeal documents only on 25 February 2004. The limitation defence was rejected for lack of pleading, and estoppel arguments were dismissed. The appeal was allowed in part.",
