  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF THE CERTIFICATES OF VALIDITY GRANTED IN CONCESSION ENQUIRIES Nos",
  "summary": "This 1933 West African Court of Appeal decision concerns a dispute over diamond mining concessions granted by subordinate stools (Asamangkese and Akwatia) to the Consolidated African Selection Trust Ltd., opposed by Nana Sir Ofori Atta, the Omanhene of Akyem Abuakwa. The Concessions Court issued Certificates of Validity subject to a condition preserving the Omanhene’s claim to one-third of rents, pending legal determination. After arbitration confirmed his entitlement to one-third of rents under customary law, and higher courts upheld the award, the Omanhene sought endorsement of the Certificates. The Court held that the issue of jurisdiction to impose the condition was res judicata and that the Concessions Court had power under Supreme Court rules to order endorsement, dismissing the appeal with costs.",
