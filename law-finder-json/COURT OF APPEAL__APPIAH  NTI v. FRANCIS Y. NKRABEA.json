  "summary": "The Court of Appeal in Accra, Ghana, heard an appeal by Appiah Nti (plaintiff/appellant) against Francis Y. Nkrabea (defendant/respondent) concerning a property dispute over H/No. A383/20, Dansoman Estates, Accra. The appellant sought recovery of possession and ejectment, which the Circuit Court had dismissed, while granting the respondent a judgment on his counter-claim for a declaration of equitable joint ownership based on a constructive trust over a sum of ₵5,000.00. The Court of Appeal found that the respondent had admitted the money was a loan and not intended for property purchase, and that the trial judge erred in law by imposing a constructive trust and declaring joint ownership. The appellate court held that no trust arose from a simple loan, set aside the judgment on the counter-claim, and allowed the appeal. The trial judge’s factual findings were otherwise upheld, but the legal conclusion on joint ownership was reversed due to misapplication of trust principles.",
