  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision in Civil Appeal No. J4/45/2011, delivered on 30th January 2013, concerned a land ownership dispute between retired army officers Major Mac Dorbi and W. O. Saviour (appellants) and Richard Adom Frimpong, George Gyesi, and Mar Geors Ltd (respondents). The appellants, while in active military service in the 1980s, were allocated three swampy plots from government land through the Chief of Staff and invested significant funds in developing them. The first respondent later claimed ownership from Nii Kotey III of La and paid $20,000 to a worker, claiming joint ownership with Mac Dorbi. The High Court initially ruled for the appellants, but the Court of Appeal reversed it, citing inconsistencies in pleadings and evidence. The Supreme Court reinstated the High Court's judgment, emphasizing that the physical developments and the $20,000 payment constituted strong acknowledgments of the appellants' title. It held that procedural lapses, including W. O. Saviour's lack of formal appearance, were waived under Order 81 rules of C.I. 47 due to full participation and the principle of substantial justice. The appeal was allowed, the Court of Appeal's decision set aside, and the High Court's judgment restored.",
