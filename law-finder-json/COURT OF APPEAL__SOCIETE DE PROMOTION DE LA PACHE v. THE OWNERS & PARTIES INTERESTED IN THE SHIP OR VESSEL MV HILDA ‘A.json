  "caseTitle": "SOCIETE DE PROMOTION DE LA PACHE v. THE OWNERS & PARTIES",
  "summary": "This appeal arose from the wrongful discharge of 1,782.30 tonnes of fish at Tema Harbour by the vessel M/V Hilda 'A', contrary to the terms of three bills of lading and a written undertaking (Exhibit B) that required delivery to Abidjan, Tema, and Lagos. The plaintiff, Societe de Promotion de la Pache (SPP), sued for breach of contract, conversion, and injunctive relief. The trial court dismissed the claim, accepting the defendant's argument of a prior barter agreement involving third parties. The Court of Appeal reversed, holding that the bills of lading and Exhibit B established a valid contract of carriage. The captain’s deviation from the agreed destinations without consignee authorization constituted both a breach of contract and conversion. The court rejected the defense that a barter agreement with IPCO justified the seizure, emphasizing that SPP’s cargo could not be subject to a lien based on another party’s obligations. The trial judge’s reliance on extraneous agreements was deemed a misdirection.",
