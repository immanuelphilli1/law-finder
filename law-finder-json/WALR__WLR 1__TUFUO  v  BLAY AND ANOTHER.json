  "summary": "In this 1956 Gold Coast land case, the plaintiff claimed title to a property in Prestea following a mortgagee's sale. The mortgagor, William Minow de Bordes, had first mortgaged the property to Kwesi Krah in 1951, then purported to sell it to the first defendant in 1953. Kwesi Krah later exercised his power of sale, and the plaintiff purchased the property on November 11, 1953. The court held that the mortgagee had the right to sell by private treaty despite the lack of explicit authorization, as the deed conferred an unrestricted power of sale. The court found that a public auction had been attempted but was stopped, and the subsequent private treaty sale was valid. The prior sale to the first defendant was declared null and void, as the mortgagee's sale extinguished the equity of redemption. The plaintiff was granted a declaration of title, mesne profits from the first defendant, and the second defendant (tenant) was ordered to pay rent to the plaintiff going forward.",
