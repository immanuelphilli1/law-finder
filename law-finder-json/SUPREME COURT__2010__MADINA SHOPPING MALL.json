  "caseTitle": "MADINA SHOPPING MALL",
  "summary": "The Madina Shopping Mall Association (appellants) appealed a lower court decision dismissing their claim for ownership of shops they had paid for at the Rosehill Height Shopping Mall. They argued that the payments made to Rosehill Gh. Ltd. and its Managing Director, E. M. Frimpong, were for the outright purchase of shops, supported by an oral agreement. However, the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal's finding that no enforceable contract existed because essential terms, particularly price, were not agreed upon. The application form (Exhibit E) did not mention sale, only allocation after deposit, and required a next-of-kin—insufficient to prove ownership. The court rejected the fraud claim, noting the appellants signed the forms without protest. While affirming dismissal, the court ordered restitution of monies paid with simple interest from the date of occupation termination to final payment, less any rent paid by those who accepted tenancy, citing its inherent jurisdiction to prevent miscarriage of justice.",
