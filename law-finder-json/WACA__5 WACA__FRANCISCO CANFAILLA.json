  "caseTitle": "FRANCISCO CANFAILLA",
  "summary": "This 1939 West African Court of Appeal decision involved a dispute over a construction contract between Francisco Canfailla (plaintiff-respondent) and Najib Joseph Chahin (defendant-appellant) for the erection of a building in Accra, Ghana. The contract, valued at £1,675, specified construction standards that materially deviated from those required by the Building Permit issued under the Accra Building Regulations, 1930. The trial court awarded damages for breach of contract, but the appellate court reversed the decision, holding that the contract was illegal because it violated statutory building regulations and was therefore unenforceable. The court emphasized that a contract to perform work in contravention of a legal enactment is void, citing Stevens v. Gourley. Additionally, the court ruled that the plaintiff could not recover for demolition work under a breach of contract claim, especially since the writ could not be amended at that stage to support a quantum meruit claim. The appeal was allowed, judgment for the plaintiff was set aside, and judgment was entered for the defendant with costs.",
