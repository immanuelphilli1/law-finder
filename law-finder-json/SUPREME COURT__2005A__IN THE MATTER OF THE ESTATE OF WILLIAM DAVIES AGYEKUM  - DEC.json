  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF WILLIAM DAVIES AGYEKUM - DECEASED 1",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed the appeal challenging the validity of a will attributed to William Davies Agyekum. The appellants alleged forgery and contested the Court of Appeal's affirmation of the High Court’s decision on due execution. The core issue was whether the trial judge erred in relying on witness testimony and a handwriting expert's report without adequately justifying the preference of evidence. The Supreme Court held that the trial judge made a crucial finding of fact—that the will was duly executed in the presence of attesting witnesses on 7th May 1985—based on credible oral testimony. This finding rendered the conflicting expert opinions on handwriting secondary. The court emphasized that fact-finders are not bound to rely on handwriting experts and may independently assess the genuineness of signatures. The appellants' misidentification of a witness was noted as an unfair tactic. The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' decisions, affirming the will's authenticity and due execution under Section 2(3) of the Wills Act, 1971 (Act 360).",
