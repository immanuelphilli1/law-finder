  "caseTitle": "NICHOLAS BERNARD ASARE v DUPAUL WOOD TREATMENT (GHANA) CO LT",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case, decided on 7th June 2006, involved a dispute between two former business partners, Nicholas Bernard Asare and Dr. Kwame Dufour, over shareholding and corporate governance in Dupaul Wood Treatment (Ghana) Co Ltd. The central issue was whether Asare remained a 50% shareholder or had his stake lawfully diluted to 10% under new company regulations adopted in 1980. The trial court held that Asare had acquiesced to the 10% shareholding, but the Court of Appeal reversed this, affirming his status as a 50% shareholder and victim of oppressive conduct. The Supreme Court examined the validity of the 1980 special resolution and new regulations, noting defects including lack of proper registration and internal inconsistencies, ultimately finding that the changes were not legally effective. The court upheld that Asare remained a member and 50% shareholder, and that his removal as director and dilution of shares constituted oppression under Section 218 of the Companies Code 1963 (Act 179).",
