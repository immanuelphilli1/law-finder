  "caseTitle": "REX v ONASIMUS OFFIONG",
  "summary": "In Rex v Onasimus Offiong (WACA/3, 28th October 1936), the appellant was charged solely with attempted rape under section 359 of the Criminal Code but was convicted of indecent assault under section 360, despite not being formally charged with that offense. The Crown relied on section 58(1) of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance, which allows conviction for a different offense if part of the original charge is proved. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that the charge of attempted rape is indivisible and that the acts proven—entering the complainant's room uninvited, undressing, and expressing intent to have sexual intercourse—constituted mere preparation, not an attempt. As such, 'part of the charge' was not proved, and section 58(1) could not justify the conviction. The court quashed the conviction and ordered a verdict of acquittal.",
