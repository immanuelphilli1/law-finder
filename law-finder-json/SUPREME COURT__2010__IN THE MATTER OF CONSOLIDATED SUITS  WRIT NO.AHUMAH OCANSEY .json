  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF CONSOLIDATED SUITS: WRIT NO",
  "summary": "This consolidated Supreme Court of Ghana decision from 2010 addressed whether remand and convicted prisoners have the constitutional right to vote under Article 42 of the 1992 Constitution. The plaintiffs, CHURCIL (a human rights organization) and Ahuma-Ocansey (a legal practitioner), challenged the Electoral Commission's exclusion of prisoners from voter registration, arguing that Section 7(5) of the Representation of the People Law, PNDCL 284, which disqualifies legal custody locations as places of residence, violated constitutional rights to suffrage, equality, and human dignity. The court declined to rule on the merits due to mootness, noting the 2008 elections had already occurred, but acknowledged the recurring nature of the issue and the ongoing constitutional relevance. It emphasized that constitutional rights disputes, especially those involving fundamental freedoms, must be adjudicated promptly in the future.",

  "verdict": "The court did not issue a final ruling on the constitutionality of Section 7(5) of PNDCL 284 due to the lapse of the 2008 elections, rendering the immediate relief sought moot. However, it recognized the ongoing constitutional significance of the issue and refrained from dismissing the case solely on mootness grounds, given the likelihood of recurrence.",
  "winningSide": "Neither party prevailed on the merits; the court avoided a substantive ruling based on procedural mootness while affirming the importance of the constitutional questions raised.",
