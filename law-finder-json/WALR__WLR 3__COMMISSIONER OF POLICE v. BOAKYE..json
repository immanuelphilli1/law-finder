  "summary": "In Commissioner of Police v. Boakye, the appellant was initially charged with conspiracy to steal, falsifying accounts, and stealing. During trial, the charges were amended: the conspiracy charge was particularized, and the stealing charge was replaced with aiding and abetting an unknown person in stealing. The Magistrate failed to call for a fresh plea after the amendment, contrary to section 172(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. The appellant was acquitted on the conspiracy charge (due to being charged only with a named co-accused who was discharged) but convicted on aiding and abetting. On appeal, the High Court held that the failure to take a fresh plea was not fatal absent a miscarriage of justice, which did not occur given defence counsel's acceptance of the amendment. It also ruled that acquittal on the conspiracy charge did not preclude conviction on aiding and abetting, as the legal elements and evidence differed. The appeal was dismissed.",
