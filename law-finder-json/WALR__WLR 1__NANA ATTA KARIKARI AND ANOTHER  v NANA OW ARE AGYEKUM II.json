  "summary": "This Privy Council decision from June 7, 1955, concerns an appeal by Nana Atta Karikari and another against Nana Ow Are Agyekum II, originating from a land trespass and recovery of possession case in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). The core issue was the taxation of costs, specifically a dispute over surveyor's fees and laborers' wages amounting to £870, which the taxing officer reduced to £9. The West African Court of Appeal allowed £736, and leave to appeal to the Privy Council was granted under Article 3(a) of the West African (Appeal to Privy Council) Order in Council, 1949–1950. The Privy Council held that a dispute solely over the quantum of costs does not constitute a 'matter in dispute' under Article 3(a), which requires a minimum value of £500. The appeal was dismissed, affirming that appeals on costs alone are only admissible in exceptional circumstances under Article 3(b) or by special leave, neither of which applied here.",
