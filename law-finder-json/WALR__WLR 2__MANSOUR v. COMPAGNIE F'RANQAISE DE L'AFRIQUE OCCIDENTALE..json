  "summary": "In Mansour v. Compagnie Franaise de l'Afrique Occidentale, the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast held that a landlord could not recover the difference between a contractual rent of 40 and a subsequently assessed standard rent of 65 during the fixed two-year term of a lease. The court ruled that Section 5(3)(a) of the Rent Control Ordinance, c. 2 of 1952, does not grant landlords the right to increase rent to the standard amount during the pendency of a contractual tenancy. The decision emphasized that the tenant's obligation to pay rent is governed by the contract, and the Ordinance only restricts rents exceeding the standard, not those below it. The judgment aligned with English precedents under the Rent Restrictions Acts, affirming that the right to receive standard rent arises from contractual agreement, not statutory entitlement.",
