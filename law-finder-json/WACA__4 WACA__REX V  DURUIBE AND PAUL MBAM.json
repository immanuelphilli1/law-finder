  "caseTitle": "REX V DURUIBE AND PAUL MBAM",
  "summary": "This 1938 West Africa Court of Appeal decision arose from convictions in the Enugu-Onitsha Judicial Division, where Chief Duruibe was convicted under section 114 of the Criminal Code for judicial corruption, and Paul Mbam, a court clerk, was convicted under section 115 for accepting a reward to influence a Native Tribunal. The appeal court dismissed Duruibe's appeal, finding sufficient evidence for his conviction. However, it allowed Mbam's appeal, quashing his conviction due to insufficient evidence linking the bribe to actual or intended inducement of the tribunal. The court emphasized that mere acceptance of a reward is not enough under section 115 without proof of intent to influence, and that the so-called corroboration from accomplice testimony and documentary records (summons counterfoil and court book) failed to substantiate the charge. The judgment also criticized the trial judge's reliance on inadmissible 'evidence of system' related to an uncharged count involving a separate bribe demand.",
