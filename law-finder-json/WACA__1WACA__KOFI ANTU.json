  "summary": "This 1933 West African Court of Appeal decision addressed whether a Provincial Commissioner had the authority to review and rescind his initial order transferring a native land dispute from a Native Tribunal to the Divisional Court, and instead transfer it to another Native Tribunal. The court held that as long as the Divisional Court had not yet been formally seized of the case, the Commissioner retained the power to review his own order under section 85 of the Native Administration Ordinance. The appeal, brought by Kofi Antu as successor of deceased family members against the Assin Ayinabrim Stool represented by Ohene Kweku Buadu, was allowed on this basis, affirming the Commissioner’s revisory jurisdiction. The court also clarified that certiorari does not lie against executive acts, such as those by the Governor under section 121, which are not judicial in nature.",
