  "caseTitle": "CONTRIBUTION OF JUSTICE TAYLOR TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF GHANA L",
  "summary": "This document reviews the judicial philosophy and key contributions of Justice Kobina Taylor of the Ghanaian High Court, particularly in the case of Nkrumah v Manu (1970). The central issue involved the applicable law in a slander action—whether common law or customary law governed. Justice Taylor rejected a rigid adherence to precedent, notably criticizing the Court of Appeal's decision in Attiase v Abobbtey as outdated following the repeal of prior legislation and the enactment of paragraph 64 of NLCD 84 (Courts Decree, 1966). He held that the statutory framework required a plaintiff to positively elect customary law for it to apply, rejecting the notion that it could be implied. Despite the binding nature of prior decisions, Taylor applied the doctrine of per incuriam to decline following erroneous precedent. His approach, initially criticized by some judges for overstepping hierarchy norms, was later vindicated by a differently constituted Court of Appeal in Kyei v Donkor, which endorsed his interpretation. The case exemplifies Taylor’s commitment to justice over technicality and his role in modernizing Ghana’s legal development.",
