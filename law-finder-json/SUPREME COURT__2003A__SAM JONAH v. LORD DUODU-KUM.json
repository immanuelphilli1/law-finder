  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case, Sam Jonah v. Lord Duodu-Kumi (Civil Appeal No. 1/2003), arose from a dispute over property ownership and tenancy at No. 109 East Cantoments, Accra. The appellant, Sam Jonah, purchased the property from Unilever Ghana Ltd., which notified the respondent of the sale. The respondent, while admitting occupation, denied Jonah's ownership, claiming the sale was a sham and that rent payments in USD were illegal under exchange control laws. He also alleged duress in making a $20,000 payment to the appellant’s wife. The High Court granted summary judgment for the appellant, but the Court of Appeal set it aside, allowing the respondent to defend. The Supreme Court ultimately held that the respondent failed to present a genuine or plausible defence on the merits, particularly due to lack of particulars on misrepresentation or duress, and that the use of USD in rent agreements does not invalidate them if payment is made in cedis. However, the court found the High Court should have assessed arrears based on the $1,500 monthly rent admitted by the respondent, not the higher amount claimed.",
