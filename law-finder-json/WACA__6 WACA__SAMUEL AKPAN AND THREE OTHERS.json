  "caseTitle": "SAMUEL AKPAN AND THREE OTHERS",
  "summary": "In this 1940 West Africa Court of Appeal decision, three appellants were convicted of possession of apparatus for making counterfeit coins under section 148(3)(c) of the Criminal Code. They appealed, challenging the admissibility and weight of evidence given by Samuel Akpan, an accomplice who pleaded guilty but was not sentenced before testifying for the prosecution. The court held that while it is preferable to sentence an accomplice before allowing them to testify, failure to do so does not necessitate quashing a conviction if the trial judge adequately warns himself on the need for corroboration and sufficient corroborative evidence exists. The court found that the trial judge had properly directed himself on corroboration and that there was sufficient corroboration in law—stronger for the third appellant and minimal but adequate for the first and second. The appeals were dismissed, following the precedent in Rex v. Robert Smith.",
