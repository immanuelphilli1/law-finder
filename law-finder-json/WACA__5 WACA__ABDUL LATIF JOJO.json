  "caseTitle": "ABDUL LATIF JOJO",
  "summary": "This case involved a dispute over the alleged breach of an oral lease agreement between Abdul Latif Jojo (plaintiff) and Alfred Augustus Cole (defendant) concerning Lucetta House in Accra. The plaintiff claimed specific performance of a 20-year lease at £200 per year, with three years' rent paid in advance. Although the trial court dismissed the claim, finding no concluded contract due to a variation between offer and acceptance and holding time to be of the essence, the West Africa Court of Appeal reversed. The appellate court held that a valid contract existed based on a prior verbal agreement confirmed in writing, with no material difference in the terms. It found no evidence that time was of the essence and that the plaintiff's delay in remitting rent was not unreasonable. However, specific performance was denied because the second defendants (Bardawil & Co.) lacked notice of the prior contract. The case was remitted for assessment of damages against the first defendant, who was also ordered to pay costs.",
