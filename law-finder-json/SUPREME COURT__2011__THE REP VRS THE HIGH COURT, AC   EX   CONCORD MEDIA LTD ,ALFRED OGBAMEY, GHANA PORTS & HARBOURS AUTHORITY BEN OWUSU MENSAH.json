  "caseTitle": "THE REP VRS THE HIGH COURT, AC EX CONCORD MEDIA LTD ,ALFRED OGBAMEY, GHANA PORTS & HARBOURS AUTHORITY BEN OWUSU MENSAH",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an application for an order of prohibition sought by Concord Media Ltd and Alfred Ogbasey to prevent the High Court, Accra—specifically Justice Benson—from continuing to hear a defamation suit (Suit No. BD 6/2007) brought by Ghana Ports & Harbours Authority and Ben Owusu Mensah. The applicants alleged judicial bias and prejudice, citing remarks by the judge calling their petition 'bogus' and describing Ogbasey as 'cantankerous.' They also objected to the judge swearing an affidavit in response, arguing it compromised impartiality. The Supreme Court found the allegations unproven on balance of probabilities, noting the court record from December 14, 2009, contradicted the claims as counsel was present. The Court emphasized that judges should not swear affidavits in such matters and reaffirmed the standard of proof in civil proceedings for bias claims, ultimately dismissing the application.",
