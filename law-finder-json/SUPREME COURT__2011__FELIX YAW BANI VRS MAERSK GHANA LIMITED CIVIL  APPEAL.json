  "summary": "In Felix Yaw Bani v. Maersk Ghana Limited, the Supreme Court of Ghana reviewed the termination of an Inland Container Depot officer who was dismissed following an internal investigation into his failure to prevent an unauthorized third-party truck from entering company premises. Although the investigative subcommittee found he was aware of the breach in July 2006 but not in August, and while two other employees involved received only warnings, Bani was terminated without observance of the 30-day notice period stipulated in the collective bargaining agreement. The High Court dismissed his claim, but the Court of Appeal awarded three months’ salary for procedural non-compliance. The Supreme Court upheld this compensation, affirming that while termination was procedurally flawed due to lack of notice under Clause 40 of the agreement, reinstatement could not be ordered under Ghanaian common law, which does not allow specific performance of employment contracts. The Court also acknowledged that issues of an inquiry committee’s jurisdiction can be raised on appeal but found no basis to declare the termination null. The decision underscores the importance of procedural fairness and adherence to collective agreements in employment law.",
