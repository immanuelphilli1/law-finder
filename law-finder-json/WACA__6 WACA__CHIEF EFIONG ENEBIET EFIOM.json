  "caseTitle": "CHIEF EFIONG ENEBIET EFIOM",
  "summary": "This appeal originated from a claim by Chief Efiong Enemiet Efion Duke and others, suing for themselves and members of Yellow Duke House, seeking rental shares from the defendant, Etubo M. George Duke Henshaw. The trial judge found the defendant liable for £72 but suspended execution pending clarification of the house's recognized representatives, as the plaintiffs failed to prove their authority to sue on behalf of the group. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that since the plaintiffs did not discharge the initial onus of demonstrating representative authority, they should have been non-suited. The original judgment was set aside because it amounted to a ruling in favor of persons unknown. However, as the defendant failed to raise the issue of authority in pleadings or cross-examination, he was not awarded costs in the lower court, though costs in the appellate court were granted to him. The appeal was allowed, the lower court's judgment and cost order were overturned, and a non-suit was ordered with each party bearing their own costs below.",
