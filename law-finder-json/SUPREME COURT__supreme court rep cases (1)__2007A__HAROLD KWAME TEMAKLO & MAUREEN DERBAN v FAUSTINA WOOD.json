  "caseTitle": "HAROLD KWAME TEMAKLO & MAUREEN DERBAN v FAUSTINA WOOD",
  "summary": "The case involved a dispute over the ownership of property (House No. 649/10, Awudome Close, Kaneshie) formerly owned by Sylvia Adoley Garshong, who died intestate in 1987. The plaintiffs, her children, claimed entitlement under the Intestate Succession Law (PNDCL 111), while the defendant, Sylvia’s mother Faustina Wood, claimed beneficial ownership, asserting she financed the property. The High Court ruled in favor of Wood, but the Court of Appeal reversed the decision, holding that Sylvia was the legal owner and that Wood failed to rebut the presumption of beneficial ownership. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment, affirming that the documentary evidence and legal presumptions favored the plaintiffs and that the defendant did not meet the burden of proof to establish beneficial ownership.",
