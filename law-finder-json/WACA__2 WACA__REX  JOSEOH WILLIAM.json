  "caseTitle": "REX JOSEOH WILLIAM",
  "summary": "The case involves an appeal against a conviction for manslaughter under section 325 of the Criminal Code, where the appellant, Joseph William, was charged in a single count with causing the deaths of three persons. The West Africa Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, holding that the conviction could not stand because the charge combined multiple alleged offences in one count, which is impermissible under legal principles. The court also found that the evidence showed the appellant was attempting to avoid a child, Victoria, who suddenly ran into the road, and thus his actions did not amount to criminal negligence as required for manslaughter. The Crown did not support the conviction, and the court emphasized that criminal negligence must involve a reckless disregard for human life, which was not present here.",
