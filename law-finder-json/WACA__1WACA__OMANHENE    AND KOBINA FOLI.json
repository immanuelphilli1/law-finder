  "summary": "This 1930 West African Court of Appeal decision in Accra concerned a motion by Omanhene Kobina Foli to set aside an arbitration award between him and Ohene Obeng Akese over a disputed tract of land in Adansi. The Full Court had previously referred the matter to arbitration after setting aside a 1923 Circuit Court judgment, appointing Supreme Court Judge Mr. Justice Hall as arbitrator. After hearing extensive evidence and inspecting the site, the arbitrator divided the land using a purple boundary line, allocating the western portion to the Omanhene and the eastern to the Ohene. The appellant challenged the award on grounds including legal error, insufficient evidence, and alleged procedural misconduct. The Court upheld the award, affirming that courts cannot overturn arbitral decisions merely due to perceived errors in law or fact when the award is valid on its face. It found no jurisdictional overreach in the arbitrator's division of the land, given the nature of the boundary dispute, and rejected claims of improper delegation to the surveyor who drew the line under the arbitrator's direction. The decision emphasized the finality of arbitration agreements and the importance of actual possession and physical features in resolving traditional land disputes.",
