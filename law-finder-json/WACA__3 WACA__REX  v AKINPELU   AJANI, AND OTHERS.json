  "summary": "In this 1936 West Africa Court of Appeal decision, four appellants were tried for coining offences under section 148(3)(c) of the Criminal Code. The fourth appellant, Tiamiyu, was convicted based on statements from co-accused, despite the prosecution presenting no admissible evidence of his possession of coining tools. The Court held that such statements by one accused against another made in absence are inadmissible unless properly safeguarded. It further ruled that where no case is made by the prosecution, the accused should be discharged before defence; failure to do so constitutes a fundamental error. Although English precedents allowed consideration of defence evidence in such cases, the Court found misdirection and procedural flaws warranted quashing Tiamiyu's conviction. The appeals of the first three appellants were dismissed, but the fourth appellant's appeal was allowed due to lack of admissible evidence and judicial error.",
