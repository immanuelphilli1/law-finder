  "caseTitle": "THE ESTATE OF JOSEPH K. NTRAKWA v BOGOSO GOLD LIMITED",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana set aside a judgment and damages award from the High Court due to serious procedural irregularities. The trial court failed to serve a hearing notice on the defendant after the summons for directions, yet proceeded to hear evidence and deliver judgment. The final judgment was delivered on 21st August 2001, rendering the court functus officio. A subsequent 'assessment of damages' on 18th September 2001 was conducted in the absence of both parties and lacked jurisdiction. The Supreme Court held that the failure to comply with court orders, particularly service requirements, rendered the entire trial null and void. It emphasized that judicial power must give effect to the will of the law, not the will of the judge. The appeal was allowed, and a new de novo trial was ordered before the High Court in Sekondi.",
