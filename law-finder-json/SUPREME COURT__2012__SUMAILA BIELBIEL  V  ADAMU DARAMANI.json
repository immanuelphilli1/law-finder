  "caseTitle": "SUMAILA BIELBIEL V ADAMU DARAMANI",
  "summary": "In Sumaila Bielbiel v Adamu Daramani (Supreme Court of Ghana, 2012), the Court ruled unanimously that the first defendant should be allowed to open his defence despite a 'no case to answer' submission. The Court emphasized that the defendant had already submitted evidence via affidavit, making it artificial and unjust to disregard that evidence and rule solely on the plaintiff's case. Citing English authorities such as Benham v Kythira Investments and Alexander v Rayson, the Court held that judges in civil cases should rarely entertain no case submissions before hearing all evidence, as it creates an inherently difficult burden to remain impartial. The decision underscores the importance of completing the evidentiary record to ensure fairness and proper fact-finding.",
