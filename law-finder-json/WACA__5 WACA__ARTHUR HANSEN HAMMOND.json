  "caseTitle": "ARTHUR HANSEN HAMMOND",
  "summary": "This Privy Council appeal from the West African Court of Appeal concerned a dispute over the ownership of St. Janet's Harbour in Accra, Gold Coast (now Ghana). The appellant, Arthur Hansen Hammond, claimed to be the rightful head of the Kreshie family and entitled to the property as family land. The respondents, descendants of Janet Plange (a daughter of Kreshie), argued the property was self-acquired. The Privy Council upheld the principle that under Fanti customary law, land is held by the family, succession follows the female line, and the family head acts as a trustee. It found that the property was inherited from Kreshie and remained family land despite attempts by Phillip Carl Randolph (son of Janet Plange) to convert it into individual ownership through mortgage and rectified reconveyance. The Council held that such transactions could not alter the customary status of the land. The appellant, being the senior male descendant through the female line from Na Momo (Kreshie’s younger daughter), was recognized as the current head of the Kreshie family and entitled to the declaration of title. The judgment reaffirmed that individual acquisitions or documents purporting to grant fee simple title do not override customary family ownership unless clearly established.",
