  "summary": "This 1956 Ghanaian land case involved a dispute over the ownership of stool land sold to a purchasing company in 1920 by the Odikro of Nsutam. The plaintiffs, members of the company, had been in continuous possession and cultivation of the land since purchase. The defendant stools argued the sale was void under customary law for lacking Okyenhene's consent and that a prior tribunal judgment against Anobi, a member of the company, estopped the plaintiffs. The Native Court ruled for the defendants, citing customary rules. On appeal, Lingley J. of the Supreme Court reversed the decision, holding that the prior judgment did not bind the entire company and that customary principles could not override general legal principles and equitable considerations, especially given the long-standing possession and development of the land.",
