  "caseTitle": "OPANIN KWABENA BOAKYE v. FRANCIS MANU",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an application for review filed by Opanin Kwabena Boakye against Francis Manu, holding that the application did not meet the required threshold for review jurisdiction. The Court emphasized that review is not an appeal and is only permissible under exceptional circumstances demonstrating a miscarriage of justice. The issues raised were found to be a rehash of those previously considered by the Ordinary Bench, with no new grounds warranting review. All justices concurred with the dismissal.",
