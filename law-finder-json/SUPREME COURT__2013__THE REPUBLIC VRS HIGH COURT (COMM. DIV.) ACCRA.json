  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION TO INVOKE THE SUPERVISORY JURISDICTION OF THE SUPREME COURT ARTICLES 88(6) AND 132 OF THE 1992 CONSTITUTION, RULE 61 OF THE SUPREME COURT RULES, 1996 (C",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana ruling addresses the relationship between international and municipal law, particularly in the context of enforcing decisions of the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea. The Attorney General sought certiorari and prohibition to quash a High Court decision, arguing that it obstructed Ghana's compliance with international obligations under UNCLOS. The Court rejected this, affirming Ghana's dualist legal system: while customary international law is automatically part of domestic law, treaties like UNCLOS require legislative incorporation to have effect in municipal law. The Court held that Article 75 of the 1992 Constitution only governs treaty ratification, not automatic domestic application. It emphasized that certiorari is a legal remedy for jurisdictional errors, not a diplomatic instrument. The ruling reaffirmed that judicial decisions cannot be invalidated merely to satisfy international commitments without legislative action, citing the ICJ's decision in Germany v Italy as support for state responsibility being fulfilled through domestic legal processes.",
