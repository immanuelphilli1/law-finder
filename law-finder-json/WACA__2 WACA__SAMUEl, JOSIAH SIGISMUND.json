  "caseTitle": "SAMUEl, JOSIAH SIGISMUND",
  "summary": "This case involved a dispute over the taxation of a solicitor's bill of costs for legal services rendered in the Gambia, which the plaintiff sought to enforce in Sierra Leone. The West African Court of Appeal held that the lower court lacked jurisdiction to order taxation according to Gambian law, and that consent could not confer such jurisdiction. The original order referring the bill to the Master for taxation was deemed a nullity. Although the appeal was dismissed, the Court set aside the challenged order and remitted the case for a new trial. Costs were apportioned to be borne by each party due to mutual negligence in drafting the consent order.",
