  "caseTitle": "MISCELLANY-AT-LAW APPOINTMENT OF SENIOR ADVOATES OF GHANA [1",
  "summary": "In 1988, the General Council of the Ghana Bar Association instituted the title of Senior Advocate of Ghana (SAG) to honor distinguished legal practitioners. Nine lawyers were appointed in the inaugural cohort, including Mrs. Joyce A. Bamford-Addo, the first Ghanaian woman to receive the honor, and Mr. Seth Y. Bimpong-Buta, the first locally trained lawyer and youngest appointee. The appointment criteria included 15 years of standing, active practice, professional competence, integrity, and adequate legal resources. At the admission ceremony on December 23, 1988, Chief Justice E.N.P. Sowah emphasized that the responsibilities of SAGs—such as promoting legal aid, mentoring juniors, and upholding ethical standards—far outweighed their symbolic privileges like wearing red-trimmed gowns or using the 'SAG' postnominal. He urged them to reject elitism, serve the poor, and strengthen the profession through organized chambers and pupilage. The event marked a significant milestone in Ghana's legal history, symbolizing the maturation of its post-independence legal identity.",
