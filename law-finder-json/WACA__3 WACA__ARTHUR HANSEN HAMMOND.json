  "caseTitle": "ARTHUR HANSEN HAMMOND",
  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by Arthur Hansen Hammond, who challenged the issuance of a writ of Cautionary for Satisfaction (Ca. Sa.) against him for non-payment of costs while suing as head of the Kreshie family. The court held that under native law and custom, a head of a family is personally liable for obligations incurred in that representative capacity, unlike a person representing a stool, whose liability may be limited. The court distinguished prior cases involving stool representatives, emphasizing that family heads assume personal liability analogous to partners in a firm. Citing Sarbah and historical precedents, the court affirmed the lawfulness of attaching the person of a judgment debtor who sues as head of a family. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
