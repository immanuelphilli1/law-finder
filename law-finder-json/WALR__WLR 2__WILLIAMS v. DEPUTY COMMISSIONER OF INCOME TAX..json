  "summary": "In Williams v. Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax (1947), the appellant, F. A. Williams, sought to deduct �700 spent on legal fees related to a pending Privy Council appeal over a deceased estate, arguing the costs were incurred to produce future income. The Supreme Court of the Gold Coast, Western Judicial Division, rejected the claim, holding that the expenses were private in nature and not incurred in the production of taxable income under section 10(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, c. 27 of 1943. Citing section 11(a), the court emphasized that private expenses are non-deductible. The expenditure was deemed a capital investment in property with speculative gain, not ordinary income generation. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the Commissioner's refusal to allow the deduction.",
