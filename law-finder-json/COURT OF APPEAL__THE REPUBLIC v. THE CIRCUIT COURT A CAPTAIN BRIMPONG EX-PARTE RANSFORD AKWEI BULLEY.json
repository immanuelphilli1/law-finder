  "summary": "This Court of Appeal decision in Ghana concerns an appeal against the High Court's refusal to grant the prerogative writs of certiorari and mandamus. The appellant, Ransford Akwei Bulley, sought to quash a Circuit Court ruling that denied him leave to amend his pleadings and to compel the trial judge to apply court rules. The Court of Appeal held that certiorari would only lie if the refusal to amend resulted in a denial of justice, which must be evident from the official record, not from extraneous affidavit evidence. The appellant failed to present a proper certified record demonstrating such a denial. The court emphasized that supervisory jurisdiction is limited to reviewing errors apparent on the record and does not permit re-evaluation of evidence. Finding that the High Court judge correctly applied the law and that the Circuit Court's decision was within its discretionary powers, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, affirming the importance of procedural rigor in applications for prerogative relief.",
