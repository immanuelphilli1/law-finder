  "summary": "The case of Ankwandah v. Gwira State Council, decided on April 28, 1956, by the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast, addressed the jurisdiction of State Councils under the State Councils (Colony and Southern Togoland) Ordinance, c. 8 of 1952. The applicant was fined £20 by the Gwira State Council for failing to attend destoolment proceedings, which the Council claimed was an offence under section 26 of the Ordinance and also a breach of native customary law. The applicant sought certiorari to quash the conviction, arguing the Council lacked jurisdiction. The court held that the Council had no authority to convict in criminal matters under section 26, as the Ordinance did not confer such jurisdiction. It further ruled that even if the matter were constitutional, the imposition of a fine was impermissible under section 9, which prohibits State Councils from imposing fines. The application for certiorari succeeded, and the conviction and fine were quashed.",
