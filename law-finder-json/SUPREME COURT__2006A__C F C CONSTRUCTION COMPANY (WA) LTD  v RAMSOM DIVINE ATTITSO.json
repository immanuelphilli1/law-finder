  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case, C F C Construction Company (WA) Ltd v Ramsom Divine Attitsogbe, centers on allegations of undue influence and inequality in bargaining power in a share transfer transaction. The second plaintiff, Rita Read, a widow and elderly shareholder, transferred 5% of her shares to the defendant, who had become a trusted figure managing her personal and corporate affairs. The defendant claimed the shares were compensation for services rendered, but the trial and appellate courts found evidence of a fiduciary relationship and presumed undue influence due to the plaintiff's vulnerability. The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' findings, affirming that the defendant was not a valid shareholder and dismissing his counterclaim for remuneration. The judgment emphasizes the protection of vulnerable parties in fiduciary relationships and the legal presumption of undue influence in unequal bargaining situations.",
