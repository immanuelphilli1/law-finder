  "caseTitle": "NANA OFOR! ATTA II, v NANA BONSRA AGYEI,",
  "summary": "This civil appeal before the West African Court of Appeal, Gold Coast, arose from a land dispute involving the Muronam Stool and the Banka Stool, where a prior judgment had already determined title. The current plaintiffs were the Omanhene of Akim Abuakwa (paramount chief) and the Odikro of Muronam (sub-chief). The trial court dismissed their claim based on estoppel, citing a 1940 judgment against the Muronam Stool in a previous suit with the Banka Stool over the same land. On appeal, the court upheld the estoppel: the second plaintiff (Muronam Stool) was directly bound by the prior judgment. The first plaintiff (Akim Abuakwa) was held estopped by conduct, as it had knowledge of the prior proceedings through its sub-chief and officials, shared the same interest in upholding Muronam’s title, and failed to intervene despite having the right and duty to do so. The court emphasized that Akim Abuakwa’s interest derived solely from Muronam’s title, making it privy to that party. Thus, both plaintiffs were barred from re-litigating the issue of title.",
