  "caseTitle": "JOHN AMPONAY OF KPEME",
  "summary": "This appeal before the West African Court of Appeal arose from a land dispute between two farmers, John Amponay and Martin Teyi, concerning a boundary trespass claim. The native Tribunal of Alavanyo found that the defendant had encroached on the plaintiff's land by planting cocoa and awarded the plaintiff a one-third share of the cocoa crop from the disputed area instead of monetary damages. The Akpini State Council reversed this decision on appeal without taking fresh evidence, a ruling upheld by the Provincial Commissioner. The WACA held that judgments in land cases by native tribunals, having observed the land and witnesses firsthand, should not be overturned unless clearly erroneous. Finding no such error and determining that the reversal was unjustified, the WACA allowed the appeal, set aside the appellate judgments, and restored the original decision of the native tribunal, awarding costs to the appellant.",
