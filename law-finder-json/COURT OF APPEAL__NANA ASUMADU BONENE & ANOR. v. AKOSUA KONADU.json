  "summary": "This Court of Appeal decision from Ghana addresses a dispute over an alleged oral and written agreement concerning the development of Anamanko Stool land in Adum, Kumasi. The plaintiff, Nana Asumadu Bonene, claimed the defendant, Akosua Konadu, breached a contract by taking over construction of a four-storey building intended for the stool, after initially financing part of it. The High Court granted summary judgment for the plaintiff based on an unstamped written agreement (Exhibit 1), declaring the defendant in breach and dismissing her counter-claim. The Court of Appeal allowed the defendant’s appeal, holding that the trial judge erred by entering judgment without hearing oral evidence, particularly since the written agreement was not stamped and thus inadmissible under law. The appellate court found that the defendant’s statement of defence raised triable issues of fact and law, including the circumstances under which she signed the agreement, and that the matter required full trial. The judgment was set aside, and the case remitted to the High Court for trial on the merits.",
