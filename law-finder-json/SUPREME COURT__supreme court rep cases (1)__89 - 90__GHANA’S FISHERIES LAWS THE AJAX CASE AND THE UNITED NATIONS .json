  "summary": "The article analyzes the 'Ajax case' involving the arrest and prosecution of a Greek fishing vessel, FV Ajax I, for illegal fishing in Ghana's territorial waters. The vessel was apprehended by the Ghana Navy in March 1989 within Ghana’s territorial sea, approximately ten nautical miles south of Ada. The crew was charged under Ghana’s Public Tribunals Law with intent to sabotage the economy by engaging in unlicensed fishing. The tribunal imposed a penalty of $650,000 and ₵4,000,000, after which the crew were released and recommended for deportation. The article evaluates the case under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which Ghana ratified, assessing the legality of the arrest, jurisdiction, and penalties. It concludes that Ghana had regulatory and criminal jurisdiction over the vessel in its territorial waters and EEZ, but highlights concerns about compliance with UNCLOS provisions, particularly Article 73, which mandates prompt release upon posting bond and prohibits imprisonment or excessive detention. The case underscores the need for Ghana to align domestic enforcement with international legal standards.",
