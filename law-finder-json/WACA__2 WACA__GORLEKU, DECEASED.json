  "caseTitle": "GORLEKU, DECEASED",
  "summary": "This 1934 West African Court of Appeal decision in *In re Estate of A. E. Gorleku, deceased* clarifies the scope of Letters of Administration under section 47 of the Marriage Ordinance (Gold Coast). The court held that such letters apply only to personal property, not real property. Real property, where the deceased could have disposed of it by will, descends automatically—two-thirds according to English Statute of Distribution (22 & 23 Car. II, c. 10) and one-third under applicable native customary law. The ruling rejected the notion that administrators hold real estate, affirming that section 47 distinguishes between distribution of personalty and descent of realty.",
