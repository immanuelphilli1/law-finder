  "summary": "This 1934 West African Court of Appeal decision involved a claim by G. B. Ollivant & Co. against Effioms Transport and E. M. Effiom for ₤205 14s. 10d. under a hire-purchase agreement, or alternatively based on an acknowledged account. The appellants argued that a novation had occurred, substituting the original debtor (Effioms Transport) with a newly incorporated entity, Effioms Transport and Engineering Co., Ltd., with the consent of all parties. The appellate court found that the plaintiffs' conduct—amending their books, accepting payments, and rendering accounts to the new company—demonstrated clear assent to the novation. As novation is a complete defense, the trial court’s judgment in favor of the plaintiffs was overturned. The appeal was allowed, and judgment entered for the defendants with costs.",

    "Novation requires consent of all parties and, if proven, is a complete defense.",
    "The plaintiffs' actions—updating their records to include 'and Co.', accepting payments from the new company, and issuing statements to it—demonstrated implied consent to the novation.",
    "The new company acknowledged the debt, made payments, and accepted statements, confirming its assent.",
    "Documentary evidence outweighed the lack of formal pleadings or trial-level reasoning.",
    "A clerical error in the writ (naming 'G. B. Ollivant & Co.' instead of 'Ltd.') was corrected and did not affect standing.",
    "The appellate court was in as good a position as the trial judge to infer consent from documentary conduct.",
    "The origin of the debt in the hire-purchase agreement did not preclude its valid transfer via novation.",
    "The trial judge’s failure to provide reasoning necessitated a de novo evaluation of the evidence by the appellate court."
