  "caseTitle": "RANSFORD FRANCE VRS ELECTORAL COMMISSION, ATTORNEY GENERAL 2",
  "summary": "In this 2012 Supreme Court of Ghana ruling, the applicant sought interlocutory injunctions to restrain Parliament and the Electoral Commission from considering or implementing the Representation of the People (Parliamentary Constituencies) Instrument, C.I. 78 (replacing C.I. 73), pending the determination of a substantive constitutional challenge. The court, per Justice Ansa JSC, dismissed the application. It held that courts cannot issue injunctions interfering with parliamentary proceedings due to constitutional separation of powers, citing Tuffour v Attorney-General. Regarding the Electoral Commission, the court applied established principles for interlocutory relief—serious question to be tried, irreparable harm, and balance of convenience—and found that halting electoral preparations would cause greater public harm than any private benefit to the applicant. The court emphasized judicial restraint in public law matters and noted that the validity of C.I. 78 would be determined in the main suit. The application was dismissed as neither just nor convenient.",
