  "caseTitle": "GUINENESSsic (GH) LIMITED v. FAFSCO DISTRIBUTORS LIMITED",
  "summary": "This appeal arose from a summary judgment granted by the High Court in favor of Guinness (GH) Limited against FAFSCO Distributors Limited for the recovery of GHS 233,988,402.26, based on cheques alleged to have been dishonoured. The Court of Appeal set aside the judgment, holding that the High Court erred in law by failing to properly consider the defendant's Statement of Defence and Counterclaim, which asserted that the cheques were not dishonoured but countermanded due to unresolved account discrepancies. The appellants argued that the plaintiff unilaterally terminated a depot contract and that mutual accounts had not been reconciled, raising triable issues on set-off and liability. The appellate court found that the High Court overlooked these substantive defences, particularly the legal distinction between 'dishonoured' and 'countermanded' cheques, and thus improperly granted summary judgment under Order 14. The appeal succeeded, with the summary judgment and refusal of stay of execution both overturned.",

    "The High Court erred by entering summary judgment without properly considering the defendant's defence that cheques were countermanded, not dishonoured.",

    "The defendant's pleading raised triable issues, including the need for account reconciliation and set-off, which preclude summary judgment.",
    "The Court of Appeal found the High Court ignored substantive elements of the defence, violating procedural fairness.",
    "The counterclaim, though questioned as 'not bona fide,' involved legitimate commercial disputes over depot contracts and financial adjustments."
