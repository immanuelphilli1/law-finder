  "summary": "This West African Court of Appeal decision from 1934 concerns an interpleader action initiated by Tesai A. Zenuah, a family member, challenging the attachment of family land for the private debt of B.H. Zenuah, the head of the family. The property, located on Pagan Road, Accra, was admitted to be family property and not the personal asset of the judgment debtor. The Police Magistrate had dismissed the claim, holding only the head of the family could sue. On appeal, the Court held that the customary law rule barring non-head family members from bringing such claims was repugnant to justice, equity, and good conscience under Section 19 of the Supreme Court Ordinance. Furthermore, the Court found Order 45 Rule 25(1) of the Supreme Court Rules empowered it to hear the claim regardless of customary law. The Court emphasized that allowing execution on family property for a private debt would result in a legal absurdity, as the debtor held no attachable interest. It ruled the property must be released from attachment, affirming the court's duty to prevent misuse of its processes, while clarifying this does not extend to allowing non-heads to initiate title actions over family land.",
