  "caseTitle": "REX v KOFI BOATENG ALIAS EBENEZER ALFRED BOATENG",
  "summary": "In this 1941 West Africa Court of Appeal case from Kumasi, Kofi Boateng (alias Ebenezer Alfred Boateng) was convicted of receiving stolen property—specifically a bottle of Black and White Whisky and a tin of Skipper Sardines—despite being acquitted of burglary and stealing charges. The appeal challenged the sufficiency of evidence linking the items to the complainant's stolen goods and the lack of a formal receiving charge. The court upheld the conviction, ruling that while there was no direct identification of the items as stolen, the surrounding circumstances—including concealment of the items, inconsistent explanations by the appellant about their origin, and failure to corroborate his claims—were sufficient under sections 27, 29, and 43 of the Criminal Code to infer guilty knowledge. The court relied on precedents affirming that circumstantial evidence can support a receiving conviction without proof of specific theft or item identification.",
