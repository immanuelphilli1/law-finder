  "summary": "In Seawornu, Amenyitor and Others v. Gakor and Others, the plaintiffs obtained judgment in the Anloga Native Court 'B' after the defendants failed to appear. The defendants applied under s. 51 of the Native Courts (Southern Ghana) Ordinance to discharge the judgment, citing improper service and lack of authorization of the court members. Upon refusal, they appealed to the Anlo Native Appeal Court, which set aside the judgment and ordered a trial de novo. The plaintiffs then appealed to the High Court, Land Division, challenging the jurisdiction on the grounds that the Native Appeal Court's order was interlocutory and that no leave to appeal had been granted under s. 52(3). Ollennu J held that an appeal under s. 51 is not interlocutory as it calls into question the judgment on the merits and thus falls under the general appeal provisions (ss. 46–48). Furthermore, although the order for retrial did not resolve the underlying land dispute, it finally disposed of the issue before the Native Appeal Court and was therefore a final decision, making the appeal properly before the High Court.",
