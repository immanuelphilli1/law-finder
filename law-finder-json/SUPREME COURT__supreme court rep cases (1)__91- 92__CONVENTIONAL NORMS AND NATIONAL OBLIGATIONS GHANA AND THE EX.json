  "summary": "This legal analysis examines the development and legal status of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) under international law, with a focus on Ghana's obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The EEZ, originating from the Truman Proclamation and later championed by African states including Ghana, grants coastal states sovereign rights over natural resources within 200 nautical miles from their baselines, while preserving navigational freedoms for all states. The paper highlights that the EEZ is a sui generis zone, distinct from both territorial seas and high seas. It critiques inconsistencies in national legislation, including Ghana's, which must align with UNCLOS to meet conventional obligations. The author emphasizes that even non-ratifying states are bound by the EEZ as a norm of customary international law, given widespread state practice and acceptance.",
