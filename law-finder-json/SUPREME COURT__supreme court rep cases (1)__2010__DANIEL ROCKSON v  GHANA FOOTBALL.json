  "caseTitle": "DANIEL ROCKSON v GHANA FOOTBALL",
  "summary": "In Daniel Rockson v. Ghana Football Association, the plaintiff, a supporter of Tema Youth Football Club, sought a declaration that certain provisions in the GFA's statutes—specifically Article 17.1.11.1–6—which restricted members and supporters from accessing courts and threatened expulsion for legal action, were unconstitutional under Chapter Five of the 1992 Constitution. The Supreme Court dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction, holding that the GFA is a voluntary association and its statutes are private agreements, not 'Laws of Ghana' under Article 11 of the Constitution. Therefore, they are not subject to constitutional review by the Supreme Court under Articles 2(1) and 130(1). The Court emphasized that enforcement of fundamental rights falls under the High Court’s jurisdiction per Article 33(1), and the plaintiff had not sufficiently identified specific constitutional rights infringed. The Court also noted that alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in private agreements do not completely bar court access, especially where natural justice is violated. The preliminary objection was upheld, and the action dismissed.",
