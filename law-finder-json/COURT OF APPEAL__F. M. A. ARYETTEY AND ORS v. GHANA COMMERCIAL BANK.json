  "summary": "In F. M. A. Aryettey and Ors v. Ghana Commercial Bank, the Court of Appeal addressed an application by new executive members of the Ghana Commercial Bank Pensioners Association for an extension of time to comply with a prior appellate order requiring disclosure of member particulars. The original respondents had instead filed a memorandum of settlement. The appellants (Ghana Commercial Bank) opposed the motion, asserting the dispute was fully settled. The Court held it lacked jurisdiction to determine the validity of the settlement, emphasizing that under s 324(d) of the Companies Code, Act 179, only the court of first instance—the High Court—could approve or reject a compromise in a representative action. The Court declined to enlarge time, ruling that such matters must first be adjudicated by the trial court where the settlement memorandum was pending.",
