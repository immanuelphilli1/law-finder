  "summary": "The document is a statutory intelligence report covering legal amendments, repeals, substitutions, and applications of various laws in Ghana between 1981 and 1982. It details how provisions from earlier legislation including Acts, Decrees, and Proclamations were modified by subsequent instruments, particularly under the Provisional National Defence Council (PNDCL) regime. Key legislative changes include amendments to the Interpretation Act, Criminal Code, Rent Act, Income Tax Decree, and numerous corporate and regulatory statutes. The report also notes the repeal of several Acts and Decrees by PNDCL 42, the continuation of certain constitutional articles, and the commencement dates of various laws. It serves as a comprehensive legislative update rather than a judicial decision.",
