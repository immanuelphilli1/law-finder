  "caseTitle": "STAY OF EXECUTION PENDING APPEAL EX PARTE SIDI [1989-90] VOL",
  "summary": "In Republic v Court of Appeal, Accra; Ex parte Sidi [1989-90], the Supreme Court of Ghana addressed the issue of whether a stay of execution pending appeal, granted on onerous terms, could be treated as a refusal allowing the applicant to reapply at the Court of Appeal under Rule 28 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The Court held that mere inconvenience or financial difficulty in meeting the conditions does not equate to a refusal. A stay granted on terms—such as payment into court—remains a valid grant and suspends execution. The decision reaffirmed that the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under Rule 28 is triggered only upon an actual refusal by the lower court, not dissatisfaction with the conditions imposed. The ruling emphasized judicial discretion in balancing the judgment-creditor's right to enforce judgment and the judgment-debtor's right to a meaningful appeal.",
