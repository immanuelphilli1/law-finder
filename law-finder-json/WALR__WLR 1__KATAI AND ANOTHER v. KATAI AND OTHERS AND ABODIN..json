  "summary": "In KATAI AND ANOTHER v. KATAI AND OTHERS AND ABODIN, the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast addressed a dispute among 'six-cloth' children of a deceased Ga man over rental income from a family property. The plaintiffs, being children from a 'six-cloth' marriage, claimed entitlement to an account of rents collected by their siblings who managed the property. The court held that while 'six-cloth' children are entitled under Ga customary law to a share in their father's estate, no such share had been formally allotted by the head of the family. Consequently, the plaintiffs could not maintain the action, as family property remains indivisible until allocation. The court emphasized that only the head of the family can sue or be sued regarding family property, and the plaintiffs' unilateral assumption of management constituted a transgression of customary law, rendering them unable to seek judicial relief.",

The dismissal of the claim due to lack of formal allotment and improper party representation is clearly stated in the judgment. The obiter on the Privy Council overturning Vanderpuye v. Botchway adds context but does not alter the court's final decision here.",
