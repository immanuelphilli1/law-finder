  "summary": "This Court of Appeal decision in Ghana concerns an application for stay of execution pending appeal in a corporate liquidation matter involving Metal Factory (Bibiani) Limited. The appellant, C. O. Nyanor, had obtained a High Court judgment declaring his ownership of 5,500,000 shares and entitlement to asset distribution, but the 1st co-respondent, Menleo Enterprise Ltd., appealed, arguing that the share allotment was illegal and that related litigation (Misc. 687/98) was still pending. The Court of Appeal granted the stay, emphasizing that execution could render the appeal nugatory, especially since the legality of the share issuance—central to both cases—remained sub judice. The court noted procedural irregularities, including non-compliance with statutory requirements under the Companies Code, Act 179, and questioned the trial court’s declaration that co-respondents were misjoined, given their direct interest in the company's share structure.",
