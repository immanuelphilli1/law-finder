  "caseTitle": "KOMLAN NANEVIE v. THE COMMISSIONER, C.E.P.S. & 2 ORS.",
  "summary": "The respondent, a Togolese national, lawfully imported a Mercedes Benz into Ghana and obtained a valid three-month licence from CEPS. While the licence was still in force, CEPS seized and sold the vehicle, claiming the respondent breached a condition prohibiting third-party use. The respondent sued for unlawful seizure and conversion. A settlement was court-facilitated whereby he repaired a Toyota Lexurus as a replacement, but CEPS failed to release it or reimburse repair costs. CEPS ignored hearing notices, leading to a default judgment. The trial judge amended the reliefs under Order 28 Rule 12 to award restitution, repair costs, damages for loss of use, and interest. On appeal, the Court upheld the judge's discretionary power to amend claims and enter default judgment but revised the awards as excessive, reducing the loss-of-use award from GHS 10 million to GHS 5 million and increasing costs to GHS 5 million. The appeal was dismissed.",
