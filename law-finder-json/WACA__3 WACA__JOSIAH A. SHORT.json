  "caseTitle": "JOSIAH A. SHORT",
  "summary": "The case involves Josiah A. Short, a licensed druggist in Sierra Leone, charged with failing to maintain a register of dangerous drugs as required under the Dangerous Drugs Rules, 1929. The Police Magistrate discharged him at the close of the prosecution's case, ruling no prima facie case was established. The Attorney-General appealed to the Supreme Court, which directed conviction. On further appeal to the West African Court of Appeal, the direction to convict was set aside. The appellate court held that while the prosecution had made out a prima facie case—based on Short's status as a licensed druggist, his purchase of dangerous drugs for dispensing, prior maintenance of a register, and unaccounted use of the drugs—the Magistrate erred in discharging him without requiring a defence. The case was remitted for full hearing of the defence.",
