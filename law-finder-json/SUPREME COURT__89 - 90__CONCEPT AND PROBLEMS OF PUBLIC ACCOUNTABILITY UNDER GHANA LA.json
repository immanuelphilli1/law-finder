  "caseTitle": "CONCEPT AND PROBLEMS OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY UNDER GHANA LA",
  "summary": "This legal analysis by Justice JNK Taylor explores the evolution of public accountability in Ghana across pre-colonial, colonial, and post-independence periods. It emphasizes the judiciary's role as the guardian of legality, while acknowledging structural limits—especially regarding legislative and executive immunity. The paper critiques the Re Akoto decision for deferring to executive power under the Preventive Detention Act, 1958, and highlights how colonial-era subordination of customary law to British 'natural justice' standards was reversed by the 1960 Republican Constitution. The work underscores tensions between democratic ideals and authoritarian practices, noting that true public accountability requires both legal frameworks and political will.",
