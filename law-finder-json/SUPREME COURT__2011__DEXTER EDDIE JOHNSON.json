  "caseTitle": "DEXTER EDDIE JOHNSON",
  "summary": "Dexter Eddie Johnson was convicted of the 2004 murder of John Kragness by a jury at the Fast Track High Court, Accra, based on circumstantial evidence. The appellant was acquitted of conspiracy to commit murder by the trial judge, who directed the jury accordingly, yet was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. He appealed both conviction and sentence, arguing that the conviction was unsafe due to inconsistent verdicts, lack of proper jury directions on circumstantial evidence, admission of inadmissible hearsay, and unlawful search leading to the recovery of a toll ticket. On sentencing, he challenged the mandatory death penalty under section 46 of the Criminal Code, 1960 (Act 29) as violating constitutional protections against inhuman treatment (Article 15(2)), arbitrary deprivation of life (Article 13(1)), and the right to a fair trial (Article 19(1)) of the 1992 Constitution. The Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal, prompting this further appeal to the Supreme Court of Ghana.",
