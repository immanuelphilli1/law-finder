  "caseTitle": "AKOSUA OTWIWA",
  "summary": "The plaintiffs, Akosua Otwiwa and Albert Kwatia, brought a claim for trespass damages before the Tribunal of Krontihene, which ruled against them. Upon appeal to the Tribunal of the Paramount Chief of Akwapim, the appeal was dismissed, despite the tribunal being irregularly constituted across hearings, with varying membership and the inclusion of the Krontihene—whose original decision was under appeal—among the appellate members. This violated the principle that no one should sit in judgment on their own decision. The Provincial Commissioner’s Court also dismissed a further appeal. The West Africa Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, declaring the proceedings before the Paramount Chief’s Tribunal a nullity due to procedural irregularities. The judgments and cost orders of both the Paramount Chief’s Tribunal and the Provincial Commissioner’s Court were set aside. The appeal from the Krontihene’s Tribunal is remitted for rehearing before a properly constituted tribunal. No order on costs was made in the Court of Appeal, though the respondent was awarded taxable costs in the Provincial Commissioner’s Court.",
