  "caseTitle": "GABRIEL JOANNE V THE REPUBLIC",
  "summary": "This is a criminal appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana concerning Gabriel Joanne, who was convicted for attempted exportation and possession of narcotic drugs. Initially refusing to plead without counsel, she later appeared without her lawyer and voluntarily changed her plea from not guilty to guilty. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, holding that while best practices require judges to explain the consequences of a guilty plea, the trial judge's failure to inquire into the appellant's decision in a summary trial did not amount to a miscarriage of justice. The appellant had previously exercised her right to counsel and was aware of her rights under Article 19(2)(f) of the 1992 Constitution. The Court emphasized that an accused may elect self-representation and that the strong evidence from the first prosecution witness further supported the validity of the conviction. The errors in the charge sheet were also deemed cured by the evidence presented.",
