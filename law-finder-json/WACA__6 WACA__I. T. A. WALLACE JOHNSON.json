  "caseTitle": "I. T. A. WALLACE JOHNSON",
  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal in a criminal libel case brought against I. T. A. Wallace Johnson. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred by not directing the assessors that a criminal libel must be calculated to cause a breach of the peace. The court held that this was not a required element, citing the 30th Edition of Archbold and the English case Rex v. Wicks, which affirmed that a libel is actionable if it is calculated to vilify a person or bring them into hatred, contempt, or ridicule. The court relied on Chief Justice Mansfield's reasoning in Thoeley v. Lord Kerry to confirm that such imputations are sufficient for indictment, even without proof of potential public disorder. Thus, the appeal was dismissed.",
