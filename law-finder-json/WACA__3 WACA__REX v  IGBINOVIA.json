  "caseTitle": "REX v IGBINOVIA",
  "summary": "The appellant was charged under sections 148(3)(c) and 152(3) of the Criminal Code for possession without lawful authority and intent to utter, respectively. The charges lacked full particulars—specifically, 'possession without lawful authority' and 'guilty knowledge or intent to utter' were not clearly set out. The court held that while such omissions would invalidate convictions in trials upon information (per Rex v. Harvey), they do not vitiate summary trials provided the accused receives adequate notice of the charges. The court found the appellant had sufficient notice and was clearly guilty on the merits. The appeal was dismissed.",
