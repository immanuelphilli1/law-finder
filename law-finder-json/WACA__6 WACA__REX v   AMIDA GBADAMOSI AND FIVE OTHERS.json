  "summary": "This 1940 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Lagos addressed an appellant's informal request to introduce fresh evidence on appeal, despite failing to file a formal application. The court acknowledged the request as an act of indulgence but refused it, emphasizing that the failure to follow proper procedure was not merely a technicality, especially since the nature of the proposed evidence remained undisclosed. The court expressed concern that granting such requests could set a dangerous precedent, enabling accused persons to delay or obstruct justice by withholding evidence during trial and later demanding that the appellate court effectively retry the case. Issues regarding trial irregularities were noted as separate matters to be assessed within the appeal grounds.",
