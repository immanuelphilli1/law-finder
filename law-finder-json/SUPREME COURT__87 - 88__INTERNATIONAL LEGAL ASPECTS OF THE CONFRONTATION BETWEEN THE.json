  "caseTitle": "OF THE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA VERSUS STATES OF AMERICA",
  "summary": "This legal analysis examines the confrontation between the Republic of South Africa and the Frontline States in Southern Africa through the lens of international law, drawing parallels with the ICJ's 1986 Nicaragua v. United States judgment. The paper highlights how South Africa engaged in direct military raids (e.g., in Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique) and indirect aggression via surrogate rebel groups like MNR and UNITA to destabilize neighboring states supporting liberation movements such as the ANC and SWAPO. It underscores violations of sovereignty, non-intervention, and the prohibition on use of force under customary international law, arguing that these actions contravene principles affirmed in the Nicaragua case. The author calls for greater application of international legal norms to address apartheid, support national liberation, and ensure peace and justice in the region.",
