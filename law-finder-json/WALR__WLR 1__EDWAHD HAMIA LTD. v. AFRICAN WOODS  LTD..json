  "caseTitle": "EDWAHD HAMIA LTD. VERSUS AFRICAN WOODS",
  "summary": "This 1956 West African Court of Appeal decision from the Gold Coast (now Ghana) concerned a dispute between Edward Hamia Ltd. and African Woods Ltd. over competing timber concessions on overlapping land in Ashanti. Edward Hamia Ltd. initially filed a concession in July 1953 that failed to comply with section 12 of the Concessions Ordinance, which required execution before a Government Agent. A supplementary agreement was later filed in March 1954, completed in proper form but covering a smaller area and effective only from its own date. African Woods Ltd. filed a validly executed concession in November 1954 over partially overlapping land and opposed Edward Hamia’s claim. The Land Court had ruled the procedural requirements directory, not imperative, and upheld Edward Hamia’s concession. On appeal, the higher court reversed, holding that section 12, read with section 13(11), imposed mandatory requirements for public protection of native landowners; non-compliance rendered the concession invalid. The supplementary document could not retroactively validate the original defective concession, especially as it varied in area and commencement date. The appeal was allowed, and Edward Hamia’s concession was declared invalid.",
