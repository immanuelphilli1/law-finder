  "caseTitle": "In the case of Ampadu v. Dankwah1",
  "summary": "This legal commentary examines the correct standard of proof required when allegations of criminal conduct, particularly fraud, arise in civil proceedings, with a focus on Ghanaian jurisprudence. The author critiques the decision in Ampadu v. Dankwah, where the court applied a higher standard of proof—akin to the criminal standard—for fraud in civil cases, relying on In re Agyepong (Decd.); Poku v. Abosi. The article argues that this approach conflicts with established principles in England and Australia, where the standard remains the balance of probabilities, albeit with heightened scrutiny based on the seriousness of the allegation. The English case Hornal v Neuberger Products Ltd is highlighted as settling the principle that civil standards apply even in serious allegations like fraud, a view affirmed by the House of Lords in Khawaja v Secretary of State. Similarly, Australian jurisprudence, beginning with Briginshaw v Briginshaw and reaffirmed in Rejfek v McElroy, holds that while the civil standard applies, courts must weigh the gravity of the allegation. The author concludes that Ghanaian courts should align with these jurisdictions and reject the notion of an elevated standard for fraud, emphasizing proportionality within the balance of probabilities framework.",

Dankwah, is legally unsound and should be abandoned in favor of the proportionate balance of probabilities standard.",

    "The decision in Ampadu v. Dankwah misapplies precedent by requiring 'proof of criminal deception' in a civil matter.",

    "The phrase 'fraud must be clearly proved' refers to quality of evidence, not a heightened legal standard."

  "confidenceNotes": "The source is a scholarly legal commentary rather than a full court judgment, so some details are interpretive. However, the analysis is grounded in authoritative case law from Ghana, England, and Australia, and the reasoning is consistent with prevailing common law principles. The absence of a full report of Ampadu v. Dankwah limits direct verification, but the critique is well-supported by comparative jurisprudence.",
