  "caseTitle": "REGINA VERSUS JACKSON.",
  "summary": "This 1958 Court of Appeal decision in Ghana addressed an application by the Okyenhene of Akyem Abuakwa for a writ of prohibition to halt proceedings by a Stool Boundaries Settlement Commissioner. The core issue was a breach of natural justice, specifically the audi alteram partem rule, as the Commissioner refused counsel's request to cross-examine the principal witness, Nene Mate Kole of Manya Krobo, on historical diaries and records used in the inquiry. Additionally, the Commissioner was accused of pre-judging issues in the Manya Krobo boundary inquiry based on findings from the Akwamu inquiry, where Akyem Abuakwa was not a party. The Court found that denying cross-examination and prior hearing constituted a serious departure from natural justice, warranting the grant of a writ of prohibition to prevent further unjust proceedings.",
