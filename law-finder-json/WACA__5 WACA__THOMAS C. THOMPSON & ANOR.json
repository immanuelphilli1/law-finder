  "caseTitle": "THOMAS C. THOMPSON & ANOR",
  "summary": "The plaintiffs, executors of Joseph William Pratt, sought re-conveyance of real property mortgaged by the deceased to the defendant after full payment of the mortgage debt. The Supreme Court dismissed the claim, holding that section 3 of Cap. 61 did not confer any interest in real estate upon executors. The West African Court of Appeal reversed this decision, ruling that section 3 of the Execution Against Real Property Ordinance, 1924 (Cap. 61), made real estate 'legal assets' subject to administration by personal representatives. Thus, the executors were entitled to redeem and recover the mortgaged property. The appeal was allowed, and the respondent was ordered to re-convey the property and pay costs.",
