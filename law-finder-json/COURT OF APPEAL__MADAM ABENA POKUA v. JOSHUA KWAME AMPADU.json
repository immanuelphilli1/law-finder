  "caseTitle": "ABENA POKUA v. JOSHUA KWAME AMPADU",
  "summary": "In this civil appeal, Madam Abena Pokua (respondent) sued Joshua Kwame Ampadu (appellant) for damages after he demolished a building in which she claimed to operate a mattress business. She alleged a 10-year lease from Kwaku Baah (P.W.1), the nephew and customary successor of the late co-owner Kwaku Wadie. The Court of Appeal found that P.W.1 lacked legal authority to grant the lease without consent from the other estate administrators and the co-owner, rendering the lease invalid under the principle 'nemo dat quod non habet'. The court also noted inconsistencies in testimony, lack of corroboration for the business, and failure to prove earnings. The Circuit Court’s judgment in favor of the plaintiff was set aside, and the appeal was allowed due to insufficient evidentiary support.",
