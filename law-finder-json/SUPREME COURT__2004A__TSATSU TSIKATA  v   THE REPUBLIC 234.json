  "caseTitle": "TSATSU TSIKATA v THE REPUBLIC 234",
  "summary": "This is a criminal appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana concerning Professor Tsatsu Tsikata, who was charged with three counts of wilfully causing financial loss to the state under section 179A(3)(a) of the Criminal Code, 1960 (Act 29), and one count of misapplying public property under SMCD 140. The appeal arose after the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's rejection of a no-case-to-answer submission. The appellant argued that applying section 179A(3)(a)—enacted in 1993—to acts in 1991 violated Article 19(5) of the 1992 Constitution prohibiting retroactive criminal liability. The Supreme Court clarified that the criminal liability could only arise from the 1996 payments made under a 1991 guarantee agreement, not the signing of the agreement itself, thus avoiding retroactivity concerns. The Court emphasized that while the contractual obligation was valid, its execution could still be criminally liable if done recklessly or unlawfully. It also held that Article 19(11) requires offences to be defined by written law, not academic sources, and remitted the matter for trial to determine whether prima facie evidence of misconduct existed.",
