  "summary": "This 1932 West African Court of Appeal decision in Ohene Appoh Ababio v. Ohene Doku Kanga concerned a boundary dispute between two divisional chiefs, the Ohene of Assenta and the Ohene of Kickam, within the Eastern Akim State in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). The core issue was whether the boundary followed the Biale River westward to the sea or turned south from a bridge to the Bobloma creek, thereby determining control over the Agona lands. The State Council and Provincial Commissioner had ruled in favor of the defendant, citing res judicata based on a prior judgment in Anopoley v. Athunli. The appellate court held that res judicata did not strictly apply because the plaintiff was neither a party nor a privy in the earlier case. However, the court found ample independent evidence supporting the boundary determination favoring Kickam, particularly the prior successful claim by a Kickam subject. The appeal was dismissed with costs, affirming the lower tribunals' factual conclusions based on customary land tenure and boundary evidence.",
