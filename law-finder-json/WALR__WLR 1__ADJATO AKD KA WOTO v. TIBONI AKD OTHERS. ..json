  "summary": "This 1956 West African Court of Appeal decision addressed the interpretation of Regulation 10 of the Native Courts (Southern Section of Togoland under British Mandate) Procedure Regulations, 1949, concerning the definition of a 'return day' in native court proceedings. The plaintiffs had initially been dismissed due to a res judicata ruling, which was overturned on appeal due to procedural irregularities. Upon remittal, the case was heard on a date when the plaintiffs were absent, and the res judicata plea was upheld again. The plaintiffs argued that this hearing date constituted a 'return day' under Regulation 10, requiring dismissal if the plaintiff was absent. The appellate court rejected this, holding that a 'return day' occurs only once per suit—when the defendant is summoned and indicates intent to defend. All subsequent dates are hearing dates, not return days. The appeal was dismissed. The court also clarified principles of customary land law, affirming that valid title to stool land requires conveyance by the rightful stool and performance of customary rites, particularly for forest land.",

  "confidenceNotes": "The document contains two distinct case summaries; the primary focus is on Adjato Akd Ka Woto v. Tiboni Akd Others regarding procedural law. The second part appears to be a separate case involving land title and customary law, possibly misattached. The structured response focuses on the first case as the main subject, with citations and rationale drawn accordingly. Some citations reference editorial notes that may pertain to the second case, introducing minor ambiguity. However, core procedural holdings are clear and consistently reported.",
