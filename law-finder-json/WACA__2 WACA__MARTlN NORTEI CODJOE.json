  "caseTitle": "MARTlN NORTEI CODJOE",
  "summary": "This 1935 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Accra dismissed an appeal by Martin Nortei Codjoe and others, who sought a declaration of title to two plots of land at Nsawam and Achimota, claiming they were family property of the late Awo Afieye. The defendants, children of J.W. Kwatchey, asserted the lands were self-acquired by their father. The Supreme Court had dismissed the plaintiffs' claims, finding that the Achimota land was purchased with Kwatchey’s personal funds and that minimal family use (such as erecting a small shelter) did not convert it into family property. Similarly, the Nsawam land was deemed personal property, as the alleged ₤100 contribution by the family was intended for cocoa trading, not land purchase, and there was no agreement to make it family property. The appellate court found no merit in claims of judicial bias due to prior proceedings, upheld the trial judge's factual findings, and ruled that the judgment was consistent with native law and custom, which requires clear agreement and purpose for converting personal property into family property. The appeal was dismissed.",
