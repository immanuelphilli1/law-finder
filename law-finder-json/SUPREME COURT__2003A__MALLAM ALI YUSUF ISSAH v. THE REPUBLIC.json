  "summary": "Mallam Ali Yusuf Issah, former Minister of Youth and Sports, was convicted by the High Court for stealing and fraudulently causing a financial loss of $46,000 to the state under sections 124(1) and 179A(3)(a) of the Criminal Code, 1960. He received concurrent 4-year prison sentences on each count and was ordered to refund the amount or face an additional 2-year sentence. The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction but quashed the 2-year default sentence for non-refund. The Supreme Court dismissed his appeal, affirming that the evidence supported the conviction beyond reasonable doubt and that the trial did not violate his right to a fair trial under Article 19 of the Constitution. The court rejected claims of improper burden of proof, denial of adjournments, and unconstitutionality of the fast-track system, finding no miscarriage of justice.",
