  "caseTitle": "THE HEAD OF FAMILY IMMUNITY PRINCIPLE THE SUPREME COURT PROP",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court in Hansen v Ankrah (1985) was divided on whether the head of a family under customary law could be sued for an account of family property. By a narrow 3-2 majority, the Court upheld the 'immunity principle,' shielding the head of family from judicial accounting actions while in office. The decision was rooted in preserving the head's authority and family autonomy, but dissenting justices emphasized accountability and the need for remedies against fiduciary breaches. Despite the ruling, the Court acknowledged its own power to depart from precedent. Later in 1985, the PNDC (legislature) abolished the immunity principle, effectively overturning the decision and affirming the head's liability to account where family property is at risk and internal resolution fails.",
