  "caseTitle": "ACQUAYE VERSUS DEEDEI",
  "summary": "In this land dispute, the plaintiff, Patience Adukwei Acquaye, succeeded her mother Akua Crabbe as head of the Effy Affuah family branch and sought a declaration of title to two plots of land in Accra, claiming they were self-acquired property of her grandmother, Effy Affuah. The defendants, sons of Akua Crabbe's brother Victor, claimed ownership based on the property being their father's self-acquired asset. The court held that under Accra Ga custom, a woman's self-acquired property passes to her children and then to her maternal family upon the death of the last child. As the defendants were not children of a Ga six-cloth marriage, they had no rights to their father's property. Even if the land had been their father's, it would have become family property upon his intestacy, with the plaintiff as head entitled to manage it. The court found the property was originally Effy Affuah's and affirmed the plaintiff's title, granting her declaratory relief, possession, ejectment, and injunction.",
