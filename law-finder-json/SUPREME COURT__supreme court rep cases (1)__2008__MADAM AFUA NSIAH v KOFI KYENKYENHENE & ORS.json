  "caseTitle": "MADAM AFUA NSIAH v KOFI KYENKYENHENE & ORS",
  "summary": "The case of Madam Afua Nsiah v Kofi Kyenyenhen & Ors involved a property dispute over House No. AM.9, Ampabame, Kumasi, which the plaintiff claimed was devised by her granduncle, Opanin Kwabena Asante, in his 1986 will for the benefit of her maternal family. The High Court initially granted the plaintiff's claim, declaring the property family property, ordering recovery of possession, and issuing an injunction. However, the Court of Appeal reversed this decision. The Supreme Court upheld the reversal, determining that the plaintiff failed to prove the will's validity and her standing to sue on behalf of the family. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the defendant's position.",
