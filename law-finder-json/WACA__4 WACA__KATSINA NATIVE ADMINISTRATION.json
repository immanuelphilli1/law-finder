  "summary": "This 1938 West Africa Court of Appeal decision involved a murder case under Mohammedan Law in Katsina Native Administration, where appellants Abdullahi Kogo, Momman Zagi Zara, and Buzu dan Dangi were convicted. The High Court, guided by Mohammedan Assessors, found that evidence reached only the stage of 'lausau' (incomplete proof), requiring the oath of 'Kasamah' by conjuratores to establish full proof. After the oaths were administered, the convictions were upheld. The appellate court affirmed this procedure as lawful under the Native Courts Ordinance and Protectorate Courts Rules, dismissing appeals based on misdirection, misreception of evidence, and weight of evidence. The second appellant, who had confessed and pleaded guilty, was not permitted to withdraw his confession.",
