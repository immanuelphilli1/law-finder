  "summary": "This is an appeal from a High Court judgment awarding GHS 30 million in damages to John Kweku Apprey, a casual labourer who lost the use of his right eye after being struck by a wooden plank at work in 1996. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that the trial, though procedurally irregular in parts, did not amount to a mistrial. The appellant, Liner Agencies Limited, had failed to appear initially, leading to judgment in default. Although it later filed a motion to set aside the judgment, the motion was struck out for non-prosecution. The appellate court found that the medical report tendered by the plaintiff was sufficient for assessing damages even without the doctor's oral testimony. It affirmed that employers owe a duty of care to all workers, including casual labourers, under the Factories, Offices and Shops Act, 1970 (Act 328), and that the defence of non-employment was invalid. The court upheld the damages as reasonable and rejected the argument that abridgement of time rendered proceedings void, noting the appellant participated fully in later hearings.",
