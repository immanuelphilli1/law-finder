  "summary": "In this constitutional case, the plaintiff sought a declaration that Rule 71B and part of Rule 69C(5) of the Supreme Court (Amendment) Rules, 2012 (C.I. 74) were unconstitutional. The court held that Rule 71B, which removes the one-month time limit for review applications in presidential election petitions, does not abolish the right to review—a right constitutionally guaranteed under Article 133(1). The court emphasized that review is a substantive right that cannot be abrogated by subordinate legislation without a constitutional amendment. The heading 'No Review' was deemed misleading but not determinative. Regarding Rule 69C(5), the court found that requiring the Supreme Court to sit on public holidays does not contravene the Public Holidays Act (Act 601), as courts are not 'businesses' covered by the Act. The ejusdem generis rule supported this interpretation. The court affirmed that the Rules of Court Committee's powers under Article 64(3) are limited to procedural matters and cannot affect substantive rights.",
