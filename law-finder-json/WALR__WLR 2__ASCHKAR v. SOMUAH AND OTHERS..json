  "summary": "In Aschkar v. Somuah and Others, the West African Court of Appeal upheld a lower court's order for recovery of possession under section 11(1)(e) of the Rent Control Ordinance, 1952, allowing the landlord to redevelop the property. The defendants contested the application, arguing the scheme was not genuine, lacked public interest, and did not constitute redevelopment. The court held that the landlord had demonstrated bona fide intent by taking concrete steps, including obtaining municipal approval, and that the Ordinance does not require public interest as a condition. It further ruled that the test for redevelopment is whether the scheme can proceed without possession, not the extent of alterations to the tenanted premises.",
