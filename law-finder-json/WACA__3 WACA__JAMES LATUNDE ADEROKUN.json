  "caseTitle": "JAMES LATUNDE ADEROKUN",
  "summary": "The West African Court of Appeal dismissed an application for leave to appeal brought by James Latunde Aderokun against the United Africa Co. Ltd on 17th April 1936. The Court held that it had discretion under Rule 11 of its rules to refuse the application and determined that no special grounds justified granting leave. It emphasized that the appellant was already pursuing remedies in another court with undisputed jurisdiction and could obtain full redress there. Allowing the appeal would encourage multiplicity of proceedings, which the Court sought to avoid. The application was dismissed with costs assessed at five guineas.",
