  "caseTitle": "GHANA LOTTO OPERATORS ASSOCIATION v NATIONAL LOTTERY AUTHOR2",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana was asked to determine whether the National Lotto Act, 2006 (Act 722) violated Articles 33(5), 35(1), and 36(2)(b) of the 1992 Constitution. The plaintiffs, private lotto operators, challenged the Act's monopoly granted to the National Lottery Authority, arguing it infringed on their economic freedoms and private sector rights. The Court held that Article 33(5) does not import unenumerated rights like a right to engage in gambling, and that Article 35(1) is not violated as sovereignty remains with the people. Regarding Article 36(2)(b), the Court found the Directive Principles non-justiciable, emphasizing they are guiding principles for governance, not enforceable rights, thus upholding Act 722.",
