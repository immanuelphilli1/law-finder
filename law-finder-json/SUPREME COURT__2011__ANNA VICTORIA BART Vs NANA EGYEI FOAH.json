  "summary": "This 2011 Supreme Court of Ghana decision in Anna Victoria Bart Plange v. Nana Egyei Foah centered on a land ownership dispute over a parcel at Momofra Akyenim in the Central Region. The plaintiff claimed ancestral ownership dating to the 19th century, while the defendant admitted prior ownership by the plaintiff's family but asserted a valid 1944 purchase by his ancestors, documented by a registered deed (No. 273A/1945). The trial High Court dismissed the plaintiff's claim, finding insufficient evidence to prove boundaries or disprove the sale, and ruled in favor of the defendant’s counterclaim. The Court of Appeal affirmed, and the Supreme Court upheld this decision, emphasizing the credibility of the defendant's ancient document under Section 130(2) of the Evidence Act, NRCD 323, and the lack of corroborative evidence from the plaintiff to support fraud allegations. The defendant's long possession and the probative value of the registered deed were pivotal in affirming title.",
