  "caseTitle": "OPARE YEBOAH & 8 ORS VRS BARCLAYS BANK GHANA LIMITED",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision arose from the summary dismissal of eight employees of Barclays Bank Ghana Limited, who were also union executives, following an alleged illegal strike on November 14, 2007. The employees were dismissed effective January 11, 2008, under Article 17 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), without prior suspension under Article 15. They challenged the dismissal, arguing that the bank violated procedural requirements, including the need to suspend first under Article 15 and provide a one-month notice period. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision, ruling that Articles 15 and 17 of the CBA operate independently and that the bank had unlimited discretion to invoke Article 17 directly when serious misconduct was proven. The Court found that the employees were given written notice outlining the charges, had the opportunity to reply, and that the dismissals were lawful under the CBA and consistent with Article 23 of the 1992 Constitution and Section 63 of the Labour Act, 2003 (Act 651). The appeal was dismissed.",
