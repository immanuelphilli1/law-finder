  "caseTitle": "TWUMASI VERSUS BADU.",
  "summary": "In Twumasi v. Badu, the West African Court of Appeal upheld the Land Court's decision that no valid customary arbitration had occurred between the parties over a land dispute. The plaintiff, claiming re-entry rights due to a subtenant's default, had contested an award made by a third party whom the defendant approached after the plaintiff repossessed the land. Although the third party conducted hearings and issued an award, the Court found no evidence of a prior agreement by the plaintiff to be bound by the decision. The Court emphasized that for customary arbitration to be binding, there must be both voluntary submission and a clear agreement to accept the arbitrator's decision as final—distinctions not met here. The appeal was dismissed, affirming that the absence of such agreement rendered the so-called 'arbitration' merely a non-binding attempt at negotiated settlement under native customary law.",
