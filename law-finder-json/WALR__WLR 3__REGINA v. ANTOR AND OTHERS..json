  "caseTitle": "REGINA VERSUS ANTOR",
  "summary": "The appellants were convicted of conspiring to prepare to attack with armed force under sections 49(1) and 342 of the Criminal Code. On appeal, the Court of Appeal quashed the convictions of the first two appellants due to procedural irregularities in the handling of jury verdicts. The jury initially returned mixed verdicts: unanimous for some, and majority splits (4-3 and 5-2) for others. Instead of accepting or properly completing the majority verdicts as required by section 298 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the trial judge allowed the jury to return for further deliberations after they requested directions. The appellate court held this was illegal, as once a majority verdict is declared, no further judicial directions may be given. The court emphasized that verdicts in joint trials must be taken at the same time and clarified that 'preparing to attack with armed force' is a substantive offence under section 342, separable from the actual attack.",
