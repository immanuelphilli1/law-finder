  "summary": "In C.K. Fynn v. O.P. Dunkor (Sub. by Moses K. Quainoo), the Court of Appeal of Ghana addressed whether the respondent, C.K. Fynn, was bound by a prior settlement in Suit No. L2/84 concerning property ownership. The appellants argued that a consent judgment in the earlier suit estopped the respondent from relitigating the matter. However, the court found that although Fynn was joined as a co-defendant, he was not a party to the settlement between the original litigants and did not consent to the withdrawal of the case. The trial judge correctly held that the order in L2/84 was not a consent judgment capable of enforcement, but merely a withdrawal of claims. The appellate court affirmed that Fynn was not bound by the settlement and was entitled to pursue his claim for damages and return of building materials. The court also clarified procedural rules regarding cross-appeals under CI 19, holding that non-compliance with formal notice requirements does not bar a respondent from seeking variation of a decision.",
