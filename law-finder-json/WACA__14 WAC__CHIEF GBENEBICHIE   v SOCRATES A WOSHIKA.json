  "caseTitle": "CHIEF GBENEBICHIE v SOCRATES A WOSHIKA",
  "summary": "This West Africa Court of Appeal case involved a dispute over family land rents managed by the Family Head, Chief Gbenebichie, who leased property in his own name. After family objections, a 1947 meeting led to the creation of the Omateye Family Trust Fund, formalized by a Memorandum (Exhibit M) and a new Constitution (Exhibit N), appointing three Trustees and a Management Committee, including the Family Head, with a provision for an annual ex gratia payment of £80 to him. He accepted this payment and participated in committee activities. Later, he refused to provide lease copies, was denied the next £80, and issued a 'Notice of Withdrawal,' continuing to collect rents without remitting them. The Trustees sued for £393 6s. 0d. The trial judge non-suited the Trustees, citing improper joinder. The Court of Appeal held that the trust documents were not registrable 'instruments' under the Land Registration Ordinance, were binding on the Family Head who had benefited from them, and that the descriptive label 'Committee of Management' did not change the joint and several liability. The judge erred in non-suiting instead of amending the pleadings. The Family Head's appeal failed, and the Trustees' cross-appeal succeeded; they were entitled to judgment.",
