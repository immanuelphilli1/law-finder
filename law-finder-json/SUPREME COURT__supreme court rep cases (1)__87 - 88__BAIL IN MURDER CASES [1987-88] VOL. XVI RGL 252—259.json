  "summary": "In Republic v Crentsil and Okoe Awulley, Justice Kpegah of the Cape Coast High Court addressed the issue of bail in murder cases under section 96(7)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Decree, 1975 (NRCD 309), which mandates refusal of bail in murder cases. The court held that this provision does not completely oust judicial discretion; bail may still be granted if the prosecution fails to present evidence establishing a prima facie case of murder. The accused had initially been denied bail by a district court due to lack of evidence, but Justice Kpegah granted bail because the prosecution's evidence—mainly blood stains in the accused's room and recent painting—was deemed insufficient to prove murder beyond suspicion. The court emphasized that a mere charge of murder does not automatically trigger the bail prohibition; there must be objective evidence supporting all elements of the offence. The ruling clarified that bail judges must assume the truth of prosecution evidence but should not assess its weight as a trial judge would. Furthermore, bail may be withdrawn if new evidence later establishes a prima facie case. The decision reinforced that a 'scintilla of evidence' is inadequate for committal or bail refusal, aligning with prior precedents and safeguarding individual liberty while recognizing the seriousness of murder charges.",
