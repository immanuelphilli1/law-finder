  "caseTitle": "YAWOGA VERSUS YAWOGA AND ATUTONU.",
  "summary": "In Yawoga v. Yawoga and Atutonu, the plaintiff sought to set aside a sale of family land by his father, the head of the family, claiming lack of consent from principal family members. The land was self-acquired property of the plaintiff's grandfather and had become family property under patrilineal succession. The court held that principal members of a family are those closest in consanguinity to the founder—in this case, the children of the deceased owner. At the time of sale, these were the plaintiff's father and aunt, Afua Yawoga. The plaintiff, being a grandchild with a living parent, was not a principal member and thus his consent was not required. The court found that Afua Yawoga had in fact consented and received part of the sale proceeds. Therefore, the sale was valid and could not be impeached. The appeal was allowed, the lower courts' judgments were set aside, and the plaintiff's claim was dismissed.",
