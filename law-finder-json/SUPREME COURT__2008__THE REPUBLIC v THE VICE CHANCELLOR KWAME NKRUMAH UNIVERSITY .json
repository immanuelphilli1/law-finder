  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC v THE VICE CHANCELLOR KWAME NKRUMAH UNIVERSITY",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case, decided on 12th November 2008, involved an appeal by five Nigerian students (appellants) dismissed from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) following alleged involvement in occultism and violence. The dismissals were carried out by the Vice-Chancellor based on an Interim Report (Exhibit KNUST '3') signed by a security officer, without clear evidence of a properly constituted Committee of Enquiry as required under Article 7 of the Students Guide. The appellants challenged the dismissal via judicial review, arguing violations of natural justice and Article 25 of the 1992 Constitution. Both the High Court and Court of Appeal upheld the dismissal, but the Supreme Court found that the respondent failed to prove the formation or proceedings of a lawful inquiry committee, thereby breaching principles of procedural fairness. The Court held that public institutions like KNUST are amenable to judicial review when exercising public functions, and the failure to comply with internal regulations rendered the dismissals unlawful.",
