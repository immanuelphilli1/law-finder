  "caseTitle": "GEORGE GRANT & CO.,",
  "summary": "This West Africa Court of Appeal decision from 1940 in Ghana affirmed the trial court's ruling that a deed of assignment by J. P. Seraphim to his brother C. B. Seraphim (the appellant) was void as a fraudulent transaction intended to defeat creditors. The assignment, made four days after a writ was served in an existing debt action, purported to transfer various properties and debts as security for a claimed debt of £3,890 4s. 6d. The trial judge found the debt not genuinely owed and the assignment not made in good faith. The appellate court upheld this, noting suspicious circumstances including the close familial relationship, lack of documentation for most of the alleged debt, the unregistered nature of the deed, and the appellant's subsequent acquisition of a power of attorney that placed him on both sides of the transaction. Despite some payments to creditors, the court found sufficient evidence to support the trial judge's factual conclusions and dismissed the appeal.",
