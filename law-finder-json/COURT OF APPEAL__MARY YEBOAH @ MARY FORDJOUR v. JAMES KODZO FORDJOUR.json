  "caseTitle": "MARY YEBOAH @ MARY FORDJOUR v. JAMES KODZO FORDJOUR",
  "summary": "This is a civil appeal from the Court of Appeal of Ghana, arising from a land dispute between Mary Yeboah (Plaintiff/Respondent) and James Kodzo Fordjour (Defendant/Appellant). The Circuit Court had entered a default judgment in favor of the plaintiff after she led evidence in her absence, based on a hearing notice served less than 24 hours before trial. The defendant appealed the refusal to set aside this judgment. The Court of Appeal held that the trial court violated Order 36 Rule 9 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, which requires at least ten days' notice of trial unless waived. The court found that only one hearing notice was served, just one day before trial, and no further notices were issued for subsequent adjourned dates despite ongoing proceedings. This breach of procedural fairness, coupled with a violation of the audi alteram partem principle, rendered the judgment fundamentally flawed. The appellate court emphasized that such rules protect substantive rights, particularly in land disputes, and cannot be disregarded. Consequently, the appeal was allowed, the default judgment was set aside, and the matter was remitted for a fresh trial.",
