  "summary": "The case of Opanin Yaw Okyere v. Opanin Appenteng & Anor. involved a dispute over the ownership and testamentary disposition of land and farm properties in Seniagya, Ashanti, under the will of the late Akua Attaa. The plaintiff claimed that the properties were family assets and sought a declaration, recovery of possession, and an injunction. The second defendant counterclaimed, asserting that the properties were self-acquired by Akua Attaa's immediate family and thus validly disposed of by will. The trial court dismissed the plaintiff's claims, upheld the counterclaim, and entered judgment for the defendants. On appeal, the Court of Appeal addressed procedural and substantive issues, including the timeliness of the judgment, failure to enter default judgment against the first defendant, and the application of the Administration of Estates Act, 1961 (Act 63). The appellate court upheld the trial court's findings, emphasizing the strength of the second defendant's evidence regarding ownership and acts of possession, and found no basis to overturn the decision.",
