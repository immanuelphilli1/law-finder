  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION UNDER ARTICLE 33 OF THE CONSTITUTION 1992 A N D IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION BY DANIEL AWUNI PER HIS NEXT FRIEND",
  "summary": "This is a constitutional case heard by the Supreme Court of Ghana on 21st July 2004, arising from an application under Article 33 of the 1992 Constitution. The appellant, Marian Awuni, brought the case on behalf of Daniel Awuni, her son, as his next friend, against the West African Examinations Council (WAEC). The case was appealed from the Court of Appeal, which had previously ruled against the appellant. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, with the judgment initially reserved and later delivered. The matter was contested purely on legal grounds, both substantive and procedural, concerning the rights of a student in relation to a public examination body. The core issue involved the enforcement of fundamental rights, particularly in the context of education and examination fairness. The court's decision to allow the appeal underscores the importance of procedural fairness and constitutional protections in dealings between individuals and statutory bodies.",
