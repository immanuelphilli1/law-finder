  "caseTitle": "TACKYIE VERSUS KABBAH..",
  "summary": "In Tackyie v. Kabbah, the plaintiff, who served as an unofficial Regent and former Chairman of the Finance Committee of a Native Authority, sued the defendant for libel over letters accusing him of fraudulently diverting public funds and improperly receiving a Regent's allowance. The defendant claimed qualified privilege, asserting a duty to report misconduct. However, the court found that the defendant had previously made similar allegations to the police, who investigated and concluded the claims were false, notifying the defendant. Despite this, the defendant renewed the accusations in a widely circulated letter. The court held that this persistence after disproof demonstrated express malice, defeating any qualified privilege. Additionally, the broad dissemination of the letter to multiple officials beyond the necessary recipient exceeded the bounds of appropriate communication under privilege. The plaintiff was not officially recognized as Regent, but was functionally treated as one, and no restitution of allowances was sought. The court found no justification for the defamatory statements and awarded the plaintiff \u0002200 in damages with costs.",
