  "caseTitle": "BENYA v LAWANI",
  "summary": "In Benya v. Lawani [1987-88], the plaintiff, a father, sued a medical officer for customary seduction after his teenage daughter became pregnant following a relationship with the defendant during a clinic visit. The trial judge awarded substantial damages without clearly defining 'customary seduction' or justifying the amount. This article critiques the decision for conflating common law and customary law principles, particularly in misapplying the concept of loss of service (a common law requirement) to a customary context where liability is based on social injury, family disgrace, and moral wrong rather than proprietary interests. The author emphasizes that customary actions for seduction of an unmarried woman are rooted in the wrong done to the individual and the dishonor brought upon the family, not in loss of service, and warns against mislabeling enticement cases as seduction, which creates legal confusion.",
