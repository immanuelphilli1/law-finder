  "caseTitle": "CHAPEL HILL SCHOOL LTD. V AG COMM OF IRS",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana ruled that Chapel Hill School Ltd., prior to its conversion into a company limited by shares in 2001, was an educational institution of a public character and therefore entitled to tax exemption on its income. The court dismissed a review application brought by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, affirming its earlier decision. The applicant sought review under article 133 of the Constitution and rule 54 of the Supreme Court Rules, alleging exceptional circumstances and miscarriage of justice. The court reaffirmed that review is not an appellate remedy but a special jurisdiction exercisable only in cases of fundamental error, per incuriam decisions, or grave injustice. It held that the original decision correctly interpreted the law and that no grounds for review existed.",
