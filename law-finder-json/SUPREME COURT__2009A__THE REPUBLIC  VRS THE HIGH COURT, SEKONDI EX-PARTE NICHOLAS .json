  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC VRS THE HIGH COURT, SEKONDI EX-PARTE NICHOLAS",
  "summary": "The Republic, on behalf of a plaintiff bank, applied to the Supreme Court of Ghana to suspend the Court of Appeal's order requiring payment of half the judgment debt (Gh\u0003150,000) as a condition for staying execution of the High Court's judgment pending appeal. The applicant argued that the respondents were impecunious and unlikely to refund the amount if the appeal succeeded. The Supreme Court dismissed the application, holding it lacked jurisdiction under rule 20 of CI 16 to interfere with the Court of Appeal's conditional stay order. It emphasized that the applicant had not first reapplied to the Court of Appeal as required by procedure, and reaffirmed that judgments merely confirmed on appeal remain orders of the lower court, not subject to stay in the Supreme Court. The Court explicitly overruled NDK Financial Services Ltd v Yiadom Construction & Electrical Works [2007-2008] 1 SCGLR 93 as per incuriam.",
