  "summary": "In this 2009 Supreme Court of Ghana ruling, 28 members of the Kejetia Traders Association (Mighty 18), led by Agyenim-Boateng, applied for an order of contempt against S.K. Boateng (Chairman) and Evelyn Akuffo Oduro (Manageress, National Investment Bank, Kumasi) for allegedly violating a stay of execution by withdrawing GH\u0002392,062.90 in compensation funds. The funds were held in trust following a property acquisition dispute. The applicants claimed the 1st Respondent withdrew the money after being served with a motion for stay of execution. However, the court found that the motion was filed on 28th July 2008, while the bulk of withdrawals occurred between 6th and 20th June 2008, prior to any stay application. The 1st Respondent's earlier affidavit stating he withdrew funds after service was corrected as a genuine mistake, supported by a bank statement (Exhibit KA7). The court held that contempt requires wilful disobedience of a clear court order, proven beyond reasonable doubt, which the applicants failed to establish. Therefore, the application for contempt was dismissed.",
