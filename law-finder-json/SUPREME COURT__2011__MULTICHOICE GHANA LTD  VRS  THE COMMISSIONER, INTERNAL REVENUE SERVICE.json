  "caseTitle": "MULTICHOICE GHANA LTD VRS THE COMMISSIONER, INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case, Multichoice Ghana Ltd v. The Commissioner, Internal Revenue Service, centered on the interpretation of the Income Tax Decree 1975 (SMCD 5) regarding the aggregation of interest income with core business income for tax assessment purposes. The appellant, a pay television company, earned interest on subscription fees deposited in interest-yielding accounts while reporting net losses by offsetting core business expenses against total income, including interest. The Commissioner disallowed this method, assessing tax on interest income separately. The High Court ruled in favor of Multichoice, holding that interest income was not severable from the company's main business. The Court of Appeal upheld the legal reasoning but reversed the outcome, prompting a Supreme Court appeal. The Supreme Court clarified that under SMCD 5, expenses must be directly linked to the income they generate, and thus interest income must be taxed independently if not directly tied to the core business operations.",
