  "caseTitle": "EMMANUEL NELSON TAMAKLOE",
  "summary": "In this civil appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal, Emmanuel Nelson Tamakloe, as plaintiff-appellant, claimed arrears of rent totaling £355 from the Basel Trading Company Limited, asserting ownership of land under a Certificate of Validity from 30th June 1934. The defendants held a concession under the Concessions Ordinance, originally granted to Hans Schumann in 1931 and later assigned to them in 1935, with a Certificate of Validity issued accordingly. A 1935 agreement reduced the annual rent from £150 to £65, with a sliding scale based on copra prices, and this variation was formally approved by the Court on 19th December 1935 under Section 31. The plaintiff, despite obtaining a 1938 court order recognizing his ownership of the land via indorsement on the Certificate of Validity, did not seek to vary the rent terms. The Court held that under Section 29 of the Concessions Ordinance, the Certificate of Validity—including its rent provisions—is binding against all adverse claimants, making the plaintiff bound by the reduced rent terms. Additionally, the Court rejected a late allegation of fraud not included in the pleadings, citing the Privy Council’s ruling in V.A.C. Ltd. v. James Eggay Taylor. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
