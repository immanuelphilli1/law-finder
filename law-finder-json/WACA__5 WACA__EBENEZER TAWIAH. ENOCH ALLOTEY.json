  "summary": "This 1939 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Ghana addressed the convictions of 31 members of the Territorial Force band for stealing during a journey from Cape Coast to Accra. The appellants were charged on three counts under section 271(2) of the Criminal Code following looting incidents at two villages. The court quashed the convictions of 15 appellants on count 2 due to their names being omitted from the charge, violating procedural fairness. It also allowed the appeals of Joseph Lamptey and Nathaniel Lartey Mingle due to judicial misdirection: the trial judge incorrectly stated that no accused gave evidence, when they had testified in defence of co-accused and asserted their own innocence. The court upheld joint liability under section 46 of the Criminal Code, affirming that all could be convicted as principals or abettors given the common purpose. It rejected misjoinder arguments, finding the charges and accused properly joined under sections 103 and 104 of the Criminal Procedure Code. While affirming the remaining convictions based on sufficient circumstantial evidence and possession of stolen goods, the court reduced all sentences from imprisonment to fines, considering the appellants' youth and context, and required them to enter into recognizances for good behaviour.",
