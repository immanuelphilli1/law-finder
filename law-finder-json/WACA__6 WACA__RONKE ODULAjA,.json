  "summary": "This is a civil appeal heard by the West Africa Court of Appeal on 16th October, 1940, concerning a consent judgment in a breach of promise of marriage case. The plaintiff-appellant, Ronke Odulaja, an infant represented by her guardian, had obtained a consent judgment for £100 and costs against the defendant, payable in monthly instalments of £1. Later, the plaintiff sought to appeal only the instalment clause, arguing she had not consented to it and that it was not in her best interest. The appellate court dismissed the appeal, holding that a consent judgment must be challenged in its entirety, not in part. The court reasoned that if one party did not truly consent to any portion, the entire judgment lacks mutual agreement. The court also noted that the proper remedy was to apply for variation under Schedule II Order 41 Rule 8 of the Rules of Court, not to pursue a partial appeal. Costs of the appeal were awarded to the respondent.",
