  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case involved a dispute over the validity of a purported will of Shadrack Kwaku Edusei, who died in 1966. The plaintiffs, members of his matrilineal family, sought to revoke probate granted in 1980 to executors under a will dated 1965, alleging it was a forgery procured by fraud. The trial High Court and Court of Appeal found the will invalid due to improper execution and fraud, a conclusion upheld by the Supreme Court. The Court emphasized that while the burden initially lies with the will's propounders to prove due execution and testamentary capacity, it shifts to the challengers if a prima facie case is made. Given the testator's likely illiteracy, the Court required proof the will was read over to him, which was lacking. The Supreme Court found no error in the concurrent factual findings of the lower courts and affirmed the decision, dismissing the appeal.",
