  "caseTitle": "COMMISSIONER OF POLICE' vclement",
  "summary": "The appellant, Clement Cobla Dogbe, a storekeeper for the United Africa Company in Kumasi, was convicted in the lower court of two counts of larceny for unaccounted motor tyres in August and September 1937, under section 276(1) of Cap. 29. The West Africa Court of Appeal allowed his appeal, quashing the conviction and entering a verdict of acquittal. The court found the evidence insufficient, emphasizing that recurring stock shortages were common and not automatically treated as theft by the company. The manager testified that deficits required definite proof before being considered stolen. The appellant offered explanations such as 'wrong issues' or unauthorized credit sales, and there was no evidence of concealment. A critical exhibit—a statement by a co-accused (Ayequaye) implicating the appellant—was deemed inadmissible hearsay and possibly coerced, as Ayequaye retracted it in court. The acquittal of the appellant on a similar October charge and of two others charged with receiving further weakened the prosecution's case. The court held that mere unexplained stock loss, without more, could not sustain a larceny conviction.",
