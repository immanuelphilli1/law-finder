  "summary": "The document examines a key jurisdictional issue in Ghanaian procedural law concerning the Supreme Court's power under Rule 66(1) of the Supreme Court Rules, 1970 (CI 13) to waive non-compliance with Rule 13(1), which mandates filing a statement of case within three weeks of notification that the record of appeal is ready. In *Darke XII v Dei XI*, the Supreme Court, by a 3-2 majority, held that Rule 66(1) grants the Court jurisdiction to waive non-compliance and restore an appeal struck out under Rule 13(2), interpreting 'action' to include appellate proceedings. However, on the same day, in *In re Oppong (Decd)*, a differently constituted bench, by another 3-2 majority, held the opposite—Rule 66(1) applies only to original jurisdiction actions, not appeals—without addressing the earlier *Darke* decision. The document critiques the *Oppong* ruling as *per incuriam* due to failure to consider binding precedent under Article 116(3) of the 1979 Constitution and highlights internal inconsistency, especially given Rule 70's definition of 'party' to include parties to appeals.",
