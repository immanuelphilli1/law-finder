  "summary": "This Privy Council appeal from the West Africa Court of Appeal concerned a property dispute over No. 16, Ajia Ijesha Court, Lagos, formerly part of family land granted to the Oshodi family after 1862. The land was allotted to a domestic (arota) under Oshodi Tappa, with a Crown grant issued in 1869. The central issue was whether the Oshodi family tacitly consented to the alienation of the land by the headman's assignee in 1912–1914, despite having no formal consent. The Privy Council held that the family did not acquiesce in the sale, emphasizing that the headman held the land in trust and lacked unilateral power to alienate. Although a custom allowing alienation with family consent had developed, the evidence of such consent was insufficient. The absence of an installed chief during the transactions did not extinguish the family’s reversionary rights. The Court overturned the Full Court’s declaration in favor of the purchasers, restoring the trial judge’s finding that the plaintiffs failed to prove family consent, thereby affirming the Oshodi family’s reversionary interest.",
