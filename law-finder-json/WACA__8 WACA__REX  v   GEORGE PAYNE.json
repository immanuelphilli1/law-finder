  "caseTitle": "REX v GEORGE PAYNE",
  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal considered whether an anonymous threatening letter sent by the appellant, George Payne, to a legal practitioner with the intent to hinder the lawful exercise of his profession constituted an offence under section 366(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, despite being unrelated to a trade dispute. The trial judge had held that no offence was committed under that section, subject to the appellate court's opinion. The appellate court rejected the argument that section 366 should be narrowly construed like section 7 of the English Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875, which typically applied in trade disputes. It held that section 366 is broader in scope, with distinct wording and penalties, and is not limited to trade disputes. Therefore, the court answered the stated case in the negative, affirming that the conduct did fall within the scope of section 366(1)(a) as an offence.",
