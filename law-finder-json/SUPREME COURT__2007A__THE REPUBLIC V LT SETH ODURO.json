  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC V LT SETH ODURO",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana ruled on a preliminary objection concerning its jurisdiction to hear an appeal by the Republic against a decision of the Court Martial Appeal Court that quashed the conviction of Lieutenant Seth Oduro for being absent without leave. The respondent argued that no direct right of appeal exists from the Court Martial Appeal Court to the Supreme Court and that special leave under article 131(2) of the 1992 Constitution was required. The Court agreed, holding that rights of appeal in Ghana are strictly statutory and not inherent. It found no provision in the Constitution or the Armed Forces Act, 1962 (Act 105), that permits an appeal from the Court Martial Appeal Court to the Supreme Court. Although the Republic claimed the appeal was from the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) due to long-standing practice, the Court rejected this, affirming that statutory provisions must prevail over practice. The Court also expressed doubt that article 131(2) could confer appellate rights where none exist and noted that even if it could, no application for special leave had been made. The appeal was therefore dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.",
