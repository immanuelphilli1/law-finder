  "summary": "In this 1958 Ghanaian civil case, Punjabi Bros. sought an interlocutory injunction to prevent E. & J. Namih from excluding them from commercial premises in Kumasi after a three-month rent-free period following a prior judgment for possession. The tenants had paid �3,500 under a written agreement that included withdrawal of their appeal and a promise of a future sub-lease if terms were mutually satisfactory. When no agreement was reached, the landlords repossessed the premises. The court, per Sarkodee-Adoo J, dismissed the injunction application, holding that the applicants failed to demonstrate a strong prima facie case or irreparable harm. The landlords were in both de jure and de facto possession, and the court emphasized that injunctions are seldom granted when legal title is disputed. The balance of convenience favored the respondents, and the evidentiary link between the payment and the agreement was unclear.",
