  "caseTitle": "MOMODU RAJI v R. M. WILLIAMS AND OTHERS",
  "summary": "This case involved an appeal against a conveyance of land executed under the power granted by the Conveyancing Act of 1881. The appellant sought to set aside the conveyance, but the West African Court of Appeal held that the protection afforded to the purchaser under section 21(2) of the Act is absolute. The court emphasized that it was not concerned with the background circumstances leading to the execution of the conveyance. As the statutory protection was unqualified, the appeal was dismissed with costs.",
