  "caseTitle": "CAROLINE MOARAYO",
  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal allowed the appeal by Caroline Moarayo, setting aside the lower court's dismissal of her claim for a declaration of ownership over land at Ibadan Street, Oko Baba, Ebute Metta. The lower court had dismissed the case at the close of the plaintiff's case, primarily due to her failure to produce the original document of title and reliance on a prior judicial finding that she lacked good title. The appellate court held that a prima facie case of title was established through a certified copy of the conveyance and unchallenged evidence of purchase from the Oloto family. It ruled that the non-production of the original title deed was adequately explained—having been obtained by Oshodi (through an auctioneer) as security—and did not justify dismissal. The court also rejected the evidential weight given to the prior litigation, holding that failure to prove title in a previous transaction had no binding effect. The case was remitted for a de novo retrial before another judge, with costs awarded to the appellant in the appellate court.",
