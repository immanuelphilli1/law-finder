  "caseTitle": "APOLLO CINEMAS AND ESTATES v. YAW BOAKYE",
  "summary": "This Court of Appeal judgment from Ghana, delivered on January 17, 2002, concerns an interlocutory appeal by Apollo Cinemas and Estates against a High Court ruling that refused an interlocutory injunction to restrain Yaw Boakye from constructing on disputed land. The appellant claimed ownership, title, and possession of the land, alleging that the respondent unlawfully demolished an existing building and began construction. The Court of Appeal found that the trial court misapplied its discretion by failing to preserve the status quo, noting that the balance of convenience favored the appellant, as irreparable harm could not be adequately compensated by damages. The appeal was allowed, the lower court's ruling was set aside, and an interlocutory injunction was granted pending final determination of the case.",
