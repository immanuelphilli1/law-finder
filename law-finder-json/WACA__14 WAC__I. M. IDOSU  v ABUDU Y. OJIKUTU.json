  "caseTitle": "I. M. IDOSU v ABUDU Y. OJIKUTU",
  "summary": "In this West African Court of Appeal decision, the appellant (judgment-creditor) challenged the Supreme Court's reversal of a Magistrate's refusal to admit a third party, Abudu Y. Ojikutu, into garnishee proceedings. Ojikutu claimed beneficial entitlement to funds being garnished from the judgment-debtor's Army contracts, asserting an assignment. The Magistrate dismissed his application on technical grounds—filing one motion for three suits and premature affidavit—and awarded excessive costs. The Supreme Court reversed, ordering Ojikutu's inclusion and reducing costs. The Court of Appeal upheld this, holding that section 87 of the Sheriffs Ordinance does not bar the court from admitting third-party claims when known, and that equitable principles require inquiry into such claims. The refusal based on technicalities and the high costs were deemed unjust.",
