  "summary": "This 1957 High Court case in the Ashanti Judicial Division of Ghana involved a dispute over the grant of letters of administration to the estate of Appieba Kanjarga alias Yaw Brenyah. The plaintiff, claiming to be the deceased's eldest surviving full brother, sought administration under customary law. The defendant countered that the deceased had been purchased as a slave by his family and had become integrated into it. The court referred questions of native custom to a Native Court under section 89 of the Courts Ordinance. The Native Court found that the deceased had succeeded the defendant's grandfather and inherited family property, forming the basis for the defendant's superior claim. The High Court held that findings by a Native Court on customary law are to be treated as findings of fact and should not be overturned unless unreasonable or unsupported by evidence. It further ruled that although claims based on slavery are generally repugnant to justice, equity, and good conscience, this principle does not apply where the deceased had himself succeeded to a position and inherited property within the enslaving family. The court granted letters of administration to the defendant, noting inconsistencies in the plaintiff's evidence regarding his relationship to the deceased.",
