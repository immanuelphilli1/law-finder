  "caseTitle": "Kwabena Appiah v . Rev. Edmund Laryea Adjei",
  "summary": "This 2007 Supreme Court of Ghana decision concerns a land sale dispute where the respondent, Rev. Edmund Laryea Adjei, sold a plot at McCarthy Hill, Accra, to appellant Kwabena Appiah for GHS 120 million in 2002, despite having previously sold it to another party. After the High Court granted summary judgment for the appellant, the respondent failed to pay and later sought a stay of execution pending appeal. The Supreme Court unanimously allowed the appeal, setting aside the Court of Appeal’s stay order, emphasizing that no executable order existed to stay and condemning the respondent’s manipulation of judicial processes, particularly given his status as a clergyman.",
