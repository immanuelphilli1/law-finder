  "caseTitle": "THE RULE IN ANGU V ATTAH",
  "summary": "This legal analysis revisits the rule in Angu v Attah, a colonial-era precedent requiring customary law in Ghana to be proven as a fact in court, akin to foreign law. The 1960 abolition of this rule by Ghana's First Republican Parliament, driven by nationalist sentiment led by President Kwame Nkrumah, aimed to rectify the perceived injustice of treating indigenous law as 'foreign.' However, the author argues that the abolition was based on a misunderstanding: the rule was not about classification but about the method of proof. Despite legislative efforts through the Courts Act, 1971 (Act 372), sections 49 and 50, to eliminate the requirement, the practical need for evidentiary proof of diverse customary laws remains due to the persistent variation among ethnic groups. The courts inconsistently applied the rule even during its enforcement, sometimes relying on academic sources like Sarbah over empirical evidence. The article concludes that the legislative abolition failed to achieve real unification of customary laws and has introduced distortions in legal administration, underscoring the continued relevance of the Angu v Attah principle for objective, impartial adjudication.",
