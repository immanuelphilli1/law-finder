  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case arose from a chieftaincy dispute over the installation of Nana Yaa Adwubi as Mamponghemaa (queenmother) of Asante Mampong. The appellants, supporters of a rival nominee, obtained an injunction from the Ashanti Regional House of Chiefs to restrain the installation, but the respondents proceeded with the enstoolment on 29 February 2000. The High Court convicted the respondents for contempt, but the Court of Appeal overturned the conviction. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal's decision, holding that the enstoolment had already occurred on 7 February 2000—prior to the injunction—based on affidavits from key traditional authorities (Krontihene, Akwamuhene, Abusuapanin) who affirmed that the customary process in Asante Mampong was complete upon nomination, acceptance, and public introduction. The Court rejected the appellants' claim that physical seating and regalia transfer were essential, citing Republic v Sito l; Ex parte Fordjour. It also found that the trial judge erred in relying on Nana Afua Saka’s affidavit, which was discredited by evidence showing she had ceased to be acting queenmother in 1994, not 2000. The Supreme Court emphasized that customary law varies by community and must be determined by credible local authorities, affirming that the respondents’ actions did not constitute contempt.",
