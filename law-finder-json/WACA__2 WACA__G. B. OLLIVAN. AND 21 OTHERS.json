  "summary": "This civil appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal in Accra (1934) involved a dispute over land title derived from the will of J. E. Mettle. The plaintiffs, including G. B. Ollivant & Co., Ltd., relied on a devise to Mettle's children as the basis of their lessors' title. The defendants-appellants challenged the sufficiency of proof of the will and the identity of the twenty plaintiffs as rightful devisees. The court held that the failure to give statutory notice under s 64 of the Court of Probate Act, 1857, was waived by the defendants' failure to object when the probate was admitted. The court also allowed evidence from the surviving attesting witness to cure any defect, finding the will valid. Regarding the identity of the devisees, the court upheld the trial judge's reliance on Aryeetey's credible testimony as a close family associate and court-appointed receiver, noting no contradictory evidence. The court rejected the argument that jurisdiction was ousted by the Native Administration Ordinance, affirming its authority to determine the issue. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
