  "caseTitle": "SUPPLY CO. LTD. VERSUS G. B. OLLIVANT LTD.",
  "summary": "The West African Court of Appeal held that a magistrate's court lacked jurisdiction to hear objections to the sale of a vehicle and trailer in execution of a decree after the sale had already taken place. The plaintiffs, Aboom Logging Supply Co. Ltd. and Victoria Arthur, had filed interpleader proceedings before the sale but the consolidated suits were heard afterward. The court interpreted Courts Ordinance, Schedule 2, Order 45, Rules 25 and 26 as conferring jurisdiction only to investigate claims prior to sale. Since the magistrate acted beyond jurisdiction, the decision not to impeach the sale could not bar the plaintiffs' subsequent claim. The appeal was allowed, the lower court's judgment set aside, and the matter remitted for trial on the merits. The court also rejected the defense of res judicata, affirming the plaintiffs' right to pursue damages in a regular suit.",
