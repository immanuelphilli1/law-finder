  "caseTitle": "E. D. J. WELLINGTON v E. QUARTEY PAPAFIO",
  "summary": "This appeal from the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast, reversing a Native Court decision, concerned a dispute over the ownership of mortgaged property following the death of the mortgagee, W. A. Wellington. The appellant, his son, claimed on behalf of all children that the family had 'given' them the mortgaged property with a life interest for their grandmother, Aku Aba. The respondents included a purchaser from the uterine brother and sister of the deceased, who were principal members of the family. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that under Ga customary law, the mortgagee's interest was personal estate devolving on the administrator (Aku Aba), and upon her death, it became family property. Only children of a 'six cloth marriage' are entitled to a right of support, not ownership. The plaintiffs failed to prove such a marital status or any formal transfer of the chattel interest from the family to them. The court rejected the Native Court's moral-based judgment, emphasizing that family property is indivisible and cannot be alienated without clear consent. As no valid transfer was proven, the plaintiffs' claim failed.",
