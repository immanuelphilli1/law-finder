  "summary": "This legal commentary examines the historical development and impact of land administration policies in Northern Ghana, contrasting them with systems in the rest of the country. The author, Agbosu L. K., highlights how colonial-era Public Lands Bills of 1894 and 1897, though defeated in southern regions due to opposition from native elites and European interests, were effectively implemented in the Northern Territories. This led to a dual land administration system in Ghana. In the North, land rights were delinked from tribal membership and instead tied to colonial citizenship, minimizing title disputes and speculation. The government assumed control through agencies like the Lands and Survey Departments, reducing the role of traditional authorities. The article emphasizes that this system significantly reduced boundary conflicts and litigation—problems prevalent elsewhere in Ghana. Despite its success, the author warns that the Northern model is under threat of abolition in favor of less effective southern systems, which could reintroduce title insecurity and administrative inefficiencies.",
