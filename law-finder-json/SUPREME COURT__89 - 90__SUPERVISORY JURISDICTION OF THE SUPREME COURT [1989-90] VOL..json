  "summary": "This legal commentary analyzes the supervisory jurisdiction of the Ghanaian Supreme Court under Article 119 of the 1979 Constitution (re-enacted in Article 132 of the 1992 Constitution). It outlines that the Supreme Court holds broad authority to issue prerogative writs—such as certiorari, mandamus, and prohibition—over all inferior and superior courts, including the High Court and Court of Appeal. The scope includes correcting jurisdictional errors and errors of law apparent on the record. The article reviews key cases, including Ex parte Quarcoo and Ex parte Puplampu I, establishing that applicants must seek prior leave from the court and cannot pursue parallel proceedings for the same relief in different courts. While initially adopting a six-month time limit for applications based on High Court rules, this was later questioned in Ex parte Darke XII, with the Court suggesting such time limits are discretionary rather than jurisdictional. The Supreme Court emphasized procedural discipline, warning that failure to follow proper channels may result in dismissal with punitive costs. The Court also clarified that statutory appeal rights do not bar certiorari applications, but the two remedies cannot be pursued simultaneously.",
