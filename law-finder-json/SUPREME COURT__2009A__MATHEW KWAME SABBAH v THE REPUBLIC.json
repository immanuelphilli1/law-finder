  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana reviewed the appeal of Mathew Kwame Sabbah, who was convicted of murder by the Court of Appeal, which had upheld the High Court's verdict. The appellant argued that the trial judge misdirected the jury by failing to instruct on the defences of provocation and self-defence, leading to a miscarriage of justice. The prosecution's case relied on eyewitness testimony that the appellant ambushed and fatally attacked the deceased and injured two others. The appellant claimed self-defence and provocation, asserting the deceased attacked him first. The Supreme Court found that the trial judge's summing up was inadequate, particularly in failing to address provocation and providing only a cursory reference to self-defence. However, upon evaluating the evidence—including the appellant's inconsistent statements, the autopsy report showing multiple severe wounds, and the fact that attacks continued after the deceased fell—the Court concluded that the force used was excessive and not reasonably necessary. Thus, self-defence failed. While provocation was not addressed by the trial judge, the Court held that even if properly directed, a reasonable jury could still have convicted based on the totality of evidence. The appeal was dismissed.",
