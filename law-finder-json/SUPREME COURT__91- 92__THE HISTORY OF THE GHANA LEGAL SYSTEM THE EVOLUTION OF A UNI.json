  "caseTitle": "THE HISTORY OF THE GHANA LEGAL SYSTEM THE EVOLUTION OF A UNI",
  "summary": "The document titled 'THE HISTORY OF THE GHANA LEGAL SYSTEM: THE EVOLUTION OF A UNI' appears to be a legal historical analysis, likely examining the development of Ghana's legal framework from pre-colonial customary systems through colonial influence to post-independence legal unification. Given its presence in a Supreme Court file, it may serve as a reference for judicial reasoning on legal evolution. However, the actual text is truncated or corrupted, preventing detailed analysis of arguments or case-specific reasoning.",
