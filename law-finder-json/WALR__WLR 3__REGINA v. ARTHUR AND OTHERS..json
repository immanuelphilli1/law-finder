  "caseTitle": "REGINA VERSUS ARTHUR",
  "summary": "In Regina v. Arthur and Others, applications for attachment orders were brought before the Divisional Court in Accra for alleged criminal contempt of the Divisional Court in Kumasi, arising from newspaper articles published during pending proceedings. The court held that only the court in which the contempt is alleged to have occurred has jurisdiction to hear such applications. Relying on precedent and Section 7 of the Courts Ordinance, c. 4 of 1951, the court ruled that although the Chief Justice has nationwide jurisdiction, this does not empower a court in one judicial division to hear contempt matters belonging to another. Therefore, the Accra court lacked jurisdiction, and the applications were refused.",
