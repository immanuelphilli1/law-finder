  "caseTitle": "GOLDEN BEACH HOTELS (GH) LTD VRS PACKPLUS INTERNATIONAL LTD",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an application by Golden Beach Hotels (Gh) Ltd to suspend a Court of Appeal order or stay execution proceedings. The applicant sought relief after its appeal against a High Court decision—upholding an arbitral award in favor of Packplus International Ltd—was deemed out of time, leading the Court of Appeal to deny a stay of execution. The Supreme Court held that the applicant failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances necessary to justify suspending lower court orders under Rule 20 of CI 16, especially where the underlying order was non-executable. The Court emphasized that mere risk of an appeal becoming nugatory is insufficient without proof of inability to restore the status quo, and stressed the need for stricter criteria for suspending proceedings compared to stays of execution.",
