  "caseTitle": "BOATENG v. DWINFUOR",
  "summary": "In Boateng v. Dwinfuor, the plaintiff claimed ownership of a house in Bekwai based on a registered title, seeking possession from the defendant who asserted an earlier oral tenancy agreement with the original owner in 1970. The defendant had repaired the dilapidated house in exchange for rent and claimed rights under customary law. The Court of Appeal held that the Land Registry Act, 1962 (Act 122) does not grant priority to registered instruments over unregistered oral agreements, as 'instrument' under section 36 means a writing, thus excluding parol agreements. However, the analysis argues that the Conveyancing Decree, 1973 (N.R.C.D. 175), particularly sections 4 and 7, renders oral customary land transactions invalid unless recorded in writing, thereby aligning them with registrable instruments. The article contends that the Court overlooked these provisions, which effectively eliminate the exclusion of oral transactions from the registration system by mandating written records for validity, thus potentially altering the outcome regarding the enforceability and priority of the defendant's tenancy.",
