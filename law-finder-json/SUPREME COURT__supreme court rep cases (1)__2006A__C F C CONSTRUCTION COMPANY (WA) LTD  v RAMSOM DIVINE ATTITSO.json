  "summary": "This 2006 Supreme Court of Ghana decision in C F C Construction Company (WA) Ltd v Ramsom Divine Attitsogbe addresses issues of undue influence, fiduciary duty, and share transfer in the context of unequal bargaining power. The case involved a widow, Rita Read, who was the sole shareholder of a construction company and allegedly transferred 5% of her shares to the defendant, who had become her trustee and managed both her personal affairs and the company. The trial and appellate courts found that a fiduciary relationship existed and that there was a presumption of undue influence due to the defendant's dominant position and the plaintiff's vulnerability. The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' findings, affirming that the share transfer was voidable due to undue influence and that the defendant was not a legitimate shareholder. The court also dismissed the defendant's counterclaim for remuneration, emphasizing the lack of independent advice and the exploitative nature of the transaction.",
