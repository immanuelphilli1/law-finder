  "summary": "This 1936 West African Court of Appeal decision arose from a case stated by the Chief Justice of Sierra Leone, referring a question of law regarding the applicability of the Bills of Sale Act, 1878, as a statute of general application in the colony. The central issue before the appellate court was whether the lower court had the authority under Section 4 of the West African Court of Appeal (Civil Cases) Ordinance, 1929, to refer a question of law without first delivering a judgment or decision. The majority, led by Chief Justice Kingdon, held that the trial judge had unfettered discretion to refer a legal question at any stage of proceedings, emphasizing procedural flexibility and judicial economy. Justice Yates concurred, stressing that the referral was valid because the legal question would finally determine the dispute. In dissent, Justice Macquarrie argued that Section 4 required the lower court to issue a decision subject to appeal, and that a mere reservation without judgment was procedurally invalid, especially where the Court's opinion would not conclusively resolve the case. The Court ultimately decided it had jurisdiction to hear the matter.",
