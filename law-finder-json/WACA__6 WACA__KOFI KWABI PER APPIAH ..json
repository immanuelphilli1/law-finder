  "caseTitle": "KOFI KWABI PER APPIAH .",
  "summary": "This case originated as an interpleader action concerning the ownership of cocoa farms attached in execution by the appellant, a judgment creditor. The respondent claimed the farms belonged to the Kukuom Stool under Exhibit 'C'. Initially, a consent judgment favored the appellant, but on appeal to Court 'A', the merits were reconsidered, the alleged admission was disregarded, and the claim in favor of the Stool was upheld. On further appeal to the Chief Commissioner's Court, the claim was amended from personal to representative capacity, reflecting that the respondent was acting for the Kukuom Stool. The West Africa Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant's final appeal, holding that the amendment was proper, no attempt had been made to attach the judgment debtor's equity of redemption, and the lower courts had correctly evaluated the case on its merits. The court clarified that nothing in the judgments prevented the appellant from pursuing attachment of the equity of redemption in the future.",
