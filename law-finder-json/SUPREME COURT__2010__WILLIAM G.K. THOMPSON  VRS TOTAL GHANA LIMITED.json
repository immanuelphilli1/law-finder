  "caseTitle": "WILLIAM G.K. THOMPSON VRS TOTAL GHANA LIMITED",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case, decided on 11th August 2010, involved William G.K. Thompson, a senior employee and Retail Network Development Manager at Total Ghana Limited, who was suspended without being given an opportunity to respond to allegations linking him to police investigations concerning misconduct at a company filling station. The suspension letter cited implication in police probes, but no charges were filed against him, and the company failed to present credible evidence supporting the allegations. The High Court and later the Court of Appeal ruled in favor of Thompson, declaring the suspension unlawful. The Supreme Court upheld these decisions, emphasizing that the employer failed to meet the burden of proof under the Evidence Act, particularly Sections 11(4) and 14, and relied on inadmissible hearsay evidence. The Court found the suspension unjustified, procedurally unfair, and in breach of natural justice, thereby affirming that the employer's actions were unlawful and without foundation.",
