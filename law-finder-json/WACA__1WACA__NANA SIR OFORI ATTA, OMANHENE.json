  "caseTitle": "NANA SIR OFORI ATTA, OMANHENE",
  "summary": "This case involved a dispute over the validity of the Amaw Tributaries Concession Zone 1, a diamond mining lease granted in 1926 by Nana Sir Ofori Atta and Kofi Dakwa over land in Topiramang, Akyem Abuakwa, to Richard Raymont Came. The African Selection Trust Ltd., Came's former employer, opposed the grant of a Certificate of Validity under the Concessions Ordinance, alleging that Came obtained the concession through improper means: (1) by breaching his employment contract and using confidential information, and (2) by procuring the grantors to violate a prior covenant giving the Trust first refusal on adjacent land. The West African Court of Appeal upheld the lower court's decision to issue the certificate, ruling that 'improper means' under section 12(3) of the Ordinance refers only to misconduct against the native grantors, not third parties. The court also held that the English Court of Appeal’s prior judgment—which found Came liable for breach of contract but not for procuring breach of covenant—was binding. It further held that even if the covenant had been breached, this would not invalidate the concession. The covenant itself was not void for perpetuities but was void for uncertainty, per Scrutton L.J. Ultimately, the appeal was dismissed, and the Certificate of Validity was affirmed.",
