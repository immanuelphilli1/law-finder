  "caseTitle": "GCPL VALENTINO GLIGAH , EC1 ABDULAI AZIZ ATISO",
  "summary": "The appellants, G/Cpl Valentino Gligah and EC/1 Abdulai Aziz Atiso, both police officers, were convicted of rape by a jury and sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment with hard labor. The Supreme Court upheld the conviction, finding that the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had non-consensual carnal knowledge of Cynthia Nyante on June 22, 1998, at the Central Police Station in Accra. The victim's testimony was corroborated by medical evidence showing vaginal abrasions and probable semen, as well as circumstantial evidence including the recovery of her earring from the crime scene. The defense of denial and claim of prior consensual relationship was rejected as unreasonable and unconvincing. The Court applied the 'oath against oath' principle from Amartey v Republic, concluding that the prosecution's case was credible and the defense lacked probability. The appeal was dismissed.",
