  "summary": "This 2011 Supreme Court of Ghana case, Lydia Anane Asamoah v. Jennis Marfo alias Appiah Kubi, arose from a contract dispute where the plaintiff sought US$130,000 for undelivered second-hand clothing. The High Court entered a default judgment for US$92,600 after the defendant failed to file a defence. The Court of Appeal set aside the judgment due to procedural irregularities, including lack of notice of adjournment from December 13 to 14, 2005, and discrepancies in the awarded amount. The Supreme Court restored the High Court's judgment, clarifying it was a default judgment under Order 13 of CI 47, not a summary judgment, and held that the procedural deviation did not nullify the court's jurisdiction, especially given the defendant's post-judgment admission of debt.",
