  "caseTitle": "KPANYINLI AND ANOTHER VERSUS WESTERN NZIMA STATE COUNCIL",
  "summary": "This case involved an application for a writ of mandamus to compel the Western Nzima State Council to hear and determine a constitutional dispute after it had dismissed the matter on a plea of res judicata. The High Court held that the State Council's ruling on res judicata was an interlocutory order, not a final judgment, and that the substantive constitutional issue remained pending. Following the reversal of the Council's decision by the Appeal Commissioner appointed by the Governor-General, the matter was still sub judice and required determination on the merits. The Court emphasized the peremptory duty of State Councils under the State Councils (Southern Ghana) Ordinance, s. 5, to hear and determine matters within their jurisdiction, and granted the writ of mandamus to ensure the continuation of proceedings.",
