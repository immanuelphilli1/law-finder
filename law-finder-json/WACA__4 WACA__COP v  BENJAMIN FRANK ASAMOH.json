  "caseTitle": "COP v BENJAMIN FRANK ASAMOH",
  "summary": "The appellant, Benjamin Frank Asamoah, chairman of the African American Trade Corporation, took possession of two consignments of cocoa (70 and 60 bags) intended for the Trading Association of the Gold Coast, which had been consigned by the Ahamansu Farmers Union. He signed the consignment notes and stored the cocoa in a warehouse he had hired, openly disclosing its location. Convicted of stealing under section 270(1) of Cap. 9, the District Magistrate sentenced him to 18 months' imprisonment. The Divisional Court dismissed his appeal, finding evidence of dishonest appropriation. On further appeal, the West African Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, holding that there was no evidence the appellant appropriated the cocoa to his own use or acted with dishonest intent. The court emphasized the lack of findings on whether the act constituted 'appropriation' under section 32(2) of the Criminal Code and acquitted the appellant due to insufficient evidence to support the conviction for stealing.",
