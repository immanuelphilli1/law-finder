  "caseTitle": "SOLOMON NTRAKWA v. G.P.R.T.U.",
  "summary": "This appeal arose from a High Court judgment awarding Solomon Ntrakwa compensation of thirty-one million, five hundred thousand cedis against the G.P.R.T.U. for preventing him from operating a petrol station on his land since 1990, plus 45% annual interest. The Court of Appeal upheld the liability but set aside the interest rate as legally unsound. The court held that while the trial judge correctly relied on witness testimony—including that of a relative (PW1)—the 45% interest award was arbitrary and not supported by evidence or statute. Interest was recalibrated to the prevailing bank rate under LI 1295 (pre-judgment) and 4% under LN 140A (post-judgment). The appellants’ challenge to the underlying judgment (in J.K. Ntrakwa v. G.P.R.T.U.) failed due to res judicata, as it had not been appealed. The claim was not subject to the writing requirement under NRCD 175, as it sought compensation for interference, not transfer of land interest. All grounds of appeal were dismissed except on interest, which was modified.",

    "The evidence of a related witness (PW1) was accepted due to lack of demonstrated bias and his continued membership in the defendant union, supporting neutrality.",
    "The trial judge’s factual findings were upheld because appellate courts defer to trial judges' assessment of witness demeanour unless findings are unsupported or erroneous.",
    "The 45% interest award was set aside as arbitrary and per incuriam; interest must follow statutory frameworks (LI 1295 for pre-judgment, LN 140A for post-judgment).",
    "The prior judgment in J.K. Ntrakwa v. G.P.R.T.U. was binding under res judicata, as it was not appealed and involved the same parties.",
    "Section 2 of NRCD 175 does not apply because the claim was for compensation for unlawful interference, not for the transfer of an interest in land.",
    "Judicial notice was taken of the fact that petrol stations in Ghana are operated on behalf of oil companies, not directly by them.",
    "An objection to venue was not properly raised in a timely manner and thus could not invalidate the trial court’s jurisdiction.",
    "The plaintiff established continuity of claim from his father, justifying use of the earlier judgment under his name."
