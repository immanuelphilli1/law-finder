  "caseTitle": "HEYMAN VERSUS ATTIPOE",
  "summary": "In Heyman v. Attipoe (1957), the plaintiff, a descendant of a common ancestress Adanshigbo, sought a declaration that disputed land formed part of the family property of all her descendants, following her intestate death. The defendant, head of a branch of the family, claimed the land had been gifted during Adanshigbo's lifetime to his ancestor Nyanya, making it exclusive family property. The trial Native Court found Adanshigbo died possessed of the land but incorrectly ruled for the defendant on an unpleaded theory. The High Court held that, under Anlo custom, the land became family property upon her intestate death. However, it dismissed claims for possession and accounting, affirming that a family head cannot be sued for accounts and that possession claims against the head are only maintainable if the claimant has a customary usufructuary interest wrongfully deprived.",
