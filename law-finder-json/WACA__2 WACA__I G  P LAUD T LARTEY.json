  "caseTitle": "INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF POLICE. VERSUS LAUD TETTEH LARTEY.",
  "summary": "This 1934 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Accra, Ghana, addressed whether an accused person could elect to be tried by jury for offences that were appropriated for jury trial under section 116 of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance. The accused, Laud Tetteh Lartey, faced charges of forgery and stealing, both of which were subject to jury trial under the Governor's order. The court held that the decision on the mode of trial—summary or by jury—rests within the discretion of the magistrate, not the accused. The court emphasized that local procedural law, particularly sections 17 and 18 of the Commissioner's Ordinance (Cap. 23), governed the matter and did not confer a right on the accused to elect trial by jury. The magistrate was therefore legally justified in determining the case summarily.",

  "confidenceNotes": "The decision is based on clear statutory interpretation of colonial-era ordinances in force in the Gold Coast. The court explicitly rejects importing English procedural rights absent local legislative adoption. High confidence in accuracy due to direct judicial reasoning and citation of relevant provisions.",
