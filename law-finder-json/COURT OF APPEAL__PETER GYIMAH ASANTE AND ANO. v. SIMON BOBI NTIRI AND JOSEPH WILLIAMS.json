  "caseTitle": "GYIMAH ASANTE AND ANO. v. SIMON BOBI NTIRI AND JOSEPH",
  "summary": "This Court of Appeal decision from Ghana addresses a property dispute involving competing claims over a house at 18 Macroni Street, Adenta, Accra. The appellants, Peter Gyimah Asante and others, purchased the property from the defendant, Simon Bobi Ntiri, for 23 million cedis in September 1995. The respondent, Simon Bobi Ntiri, had earlier entered into an agreement with Simon Bobi Ntiri and Joseph Williams in January 1995 to sell the same property for 16.5 million cedis, but that transaction was not completed or registered. The trial court dismissed the appellants' claim, holding they were not innocent purchasers without notice due to court processes posted on the property. The Court of Appeal reversed this, ruling that the appellants were bona fide purchasers without notice, as the court processes were affixed after their purchase and neither party had registered their interest. The court emphasized that under section 36(4) of the Conveyancing Decree, NRCD 175, failure to investigate title does not impute constructive notice. The appeal was allowed, affirming the appellants' superior equitable claim.",
