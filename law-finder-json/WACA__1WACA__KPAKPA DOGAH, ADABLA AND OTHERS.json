  "summary": "This 1931 West African Court of Appeal decision in Accra addressed an appeal from a ruling that discharged a rule nisi for a writ of Habeas Corpus. The appellant, Kpakpa Dogah, had been detained for three months by the Awuna Native Tribunal over unpaid legal costs following a land dispute. Although he initially obtained conditional leave to appeal, procedural irregularities arose, including failure to notify key parties. Crucially, the appeal was dismissed because the appellant was no longer detained, rendering the Habeas Corpus proceedings moot. The court emphasized that such appeals cannot proceed when the detainee is at large, as the writ's sole purpose is to secure release from unlawful detention. The court also noted the appeal appeared to be an indirect challenge to the Native Tribunal’s decision rather than a genuine liberty claim.",
