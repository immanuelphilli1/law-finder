  "caseTitle": "OHN AMPONAY OF KPEME",
  "summary": "This is an appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal concerning a land dispute between John Amponay and Martin Teyi of Kpeme over alleged trespass by encroachment of a cocoa farm. The native tribunal of Alavanyo found that the defendant had crossed the boundary and awarded the plaintiff one-third of the cocoa crop from the encroached land instead of monetary damages. The Akpini State Council reversed this decision on appeal without taking fresh evidence, a decision upheld by the Provincial Commissioner. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that judgments of native tribunals in land matters, having seen and heard witnesses and viewed the land, should not be overturned unless clearly erroneous. Finding no such error and noting that the reversal was unjustified, the appellate court allowed the appeal, set aside the lower appellate decisions, and restored the original judgment of the native tribunal. Costs were awarded to the appellant.",
