  "summary": "This 1957 Supreme Court of Ghana case involved a dispute over the ownership and control of family land known as Abramadzie, belonging to the Odumna family, which had branches in Moree, Queen Anne's Point (Ekon), and Cape Coast. The head of the Moree branch attempted to dispose of part of the land without the consent of the other branches. The defendant argued that the Cape Coast and Ekon branches had severed family ties and thus lost their rights. The Native Court ruled in favor of the defendant, declaring him the absolute owner. On appeal, the Supreme Court held that mere disaffection does not sever family ties; formal acts such as partition or a public declaration are required. It found no evidence of such acts and emphasized that the head of the family holds property in trust, requiring consent from principal members of all branches for valid disposition. The appeal was allowed, the Native Court's judgment was set aside, and a declaration was issued affirming the collective ownership and shared control of the land.",
