  "summary": "The case of Ebusuapanyin Yaa Kwesi v Arhin Davis & Anor involved a land dispute over ownership and possession of a parcel of land at Anagye, Ghana. The plaintiff, claiming to be the head of the Basia Aya’s Ebiradze Family, sought a declaration of title, damages for trespass, an order to quash a lease, and a perpetual injunction. The defendants relied on a 1912 judgment and prior litigation to argue estoppel, asserting that the plaintiff's ancestor had admitted selling the land. The High Court dismissed the plaintiff's claim, finding failure to prove title and applying issue estoppel. The Court of Appeal upheld this decision, emphasizing admissions by predecessors as binding. The Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the plaintiff failed to discharge the burden of proof and that prior judicial admissions created issue estoppel, barring relitigation of ownership.",
