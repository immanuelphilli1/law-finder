  "summary": "This 1934 West Africa Court of Appeal case involved a dispute over a loan of £100, later increased to £200 through contractual agreements, secured by a promissory note and gold ornaments. The plaintiff sued multiple traditional leaders from Essikuma, initially in the Police Magistrate's Court in Accra. A jurisdictional challenge arose because the defendants resided in the Central Province. The Police Magistrate ruled he had jurisdiction because the loan was made in Accra and the contract was to be performed there. The Divisional Court reversed, citing lack of jurisdiction under Schedule II, Order 9, Rule 5 of the Supreme Court Ordinance. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that the suit was properly before the Accra court as a contract case performable in Accra under Rule 3, and that the Magistrate’s order retaining the case under Rule 6 was not appealable. The appeal was allowed, costs awarded to the appellant, and the case remitted to the Divisional Court to consider other grounds of appeal.",
