  "summary": "In this civil case before the West African Court of Appeal, the plaintiff sued the President, Councillors, and Citizens of Freetown for £56 1s, but failed to prove service of the written notice required under Section 180(1) of the Freetown Municipality Ordinance, 1927. That provision prohibits the issuance or service of writs against municipal officers unless one month after written notice—detailing the cause of action, plaintiff's name and address, and solicitor's information—has been served. The court held that the failure to serve such notice constitutes a statutory defence, which must be specially pleaded under Order XIX, Rule 7 of the County Court Rules. Since the plaintiff did not meet this prerequisite, the trial court entered judgment for the defendants, a decision upheld on appeal. The case underscores the mandatory nature of statutory notice requirements in actions against protected municipal officers.",
