  "summary": "This Court of Appeal case from Ghana, Opanin Manukure Sampong and Others v. Opanin Kwaku Ampadu and Others, centered on a dispute over the succession to the self-acquired property of Opanin Daaku, a former occupant of the Gyasewa Stool of Abetifi. The plaintiffs, led by the first plaintiff as head of the Daaku Asona Family, sought declaration of title, recovery of possession, and injunction over eight parcels of land, most of which were self-acquired by Opanin Daaku before his enstoolment. The defendants claimed customary succession through the Gyasewa Stool, arguing that the stool's occupant automatically inherits Opanin Daaku’s property. The Court of Appeal overturned the High Court’s decision, holding that the alleged custom was unproven and contrary to Ghanaian customary law. It affirmed that self-acquired property devolves to the family upon intestacy, with management rights vesting in the immediate or wider family head. The Court also ruled that the first plaintiff remained the valid head of family, as his removal lacked proper customary procedure, and emphasized that a head of family has the legal capacity to sue for family property. The appeal was allowed, and the plaintiffs' rights to the properties (except Lot 3, acquired by the first defendant in office) were upheld.",
