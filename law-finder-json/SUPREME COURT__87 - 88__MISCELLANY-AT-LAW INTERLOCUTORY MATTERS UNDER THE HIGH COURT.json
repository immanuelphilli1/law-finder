  "caseTitle": "MISCELLANY-AT-LAW INTERLOCUTORY MATTERS UNDER THE HIGH COURT",
  "summary": "This legal commentary by Justice Adade N.Y.B. of the Ghanaian Supreme Court examines interlocutory matters under the High Court Rules, focusing on injunctions, stay of execution, and aspects of pleadings. Interlocutory orders are defined as judicial directives issued during the pendency of a case that do not finally determine the rights of the parties. The discussion emphasizes procedural requirements for injunctions under Order 50 and Order 52 of the High Court Rules, distinguishing between ex parte interim orders (granted only in emergencies) and interlocutory injunctions granted on notice. The court must consider factors such as hardship to parties, preservation of the status quo, adequacy of damages, and the applicant's prima facie case when deciding on injunctions. The commentary critiques the routine appointment of court registrars as receivers in land disputes, suggesting private individuals may better serve the parties' interests. It also clarifies timing rules for applications, noting plaintiffs may apply for injunctions after issuing a writ of summons, but service of notice generally requires prior service of the writ unless leave is granted. The truncated text appears to transition into permanent injunctions and pleading requirements.",
