  "summary": "In this 1956 Supreme Court of the Gold Coast case, the plaintiff claimed ownership of a farm inherited from Kwame Nuro, managed by a caretaker who paid proceeds through successive stool occupants. The second defendant, the current Nseniahene, claimed the farm was gifted to the Nsenia Stool by Kwame Nuro during the prior occupant's tenure. The Asantehene's Court had reversed the Native Court's ruling in favor of the defendants, citing lack of an inventory and insufficient evidence. The Supreme Court held that no customary obligation exists to produce a written inventory of stool property upon enstoolment, and thus its absence cannot invalidate a claim. It emphasized that for a gift of immovable property to a stool to be valid under native custom, publicity must be established, typically through testimony from stool elders. The court criticized the lower court for taking judicial notice of witness status without proper record, but affirmed that the Native Court’s factual findings—based on credible evidence of a valid customary gift—should not be disturbed on appeal. The appeal was allowed, restoring the original judgment in favor of the defendants.",
