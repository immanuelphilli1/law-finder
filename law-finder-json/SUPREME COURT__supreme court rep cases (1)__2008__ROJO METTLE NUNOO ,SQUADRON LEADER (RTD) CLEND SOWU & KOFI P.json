  "summary": "In this 2008 Supreme Court of Ghana decision, the plaintiffs—Rojo Mettle Nunoo, Squadron Leader (Rtd) Clend Sowu, and Kofi Portuphy—sought declarations and orders compelling the Electoral Commission to publish full, detailed results of the December 2004 Presidential Election in the Ghana Gazette, including constituency-level and polling station data. They argued that the Commission's publication of only the 'Declaration of President Elect Instrument, 2004' (CI 49), which named John Agyekum Kufuor as winner without detailed results, failed to meet constitutional obligations under Article 63(9) and violated principles of transparency under Article 45. The Commission contended it had fulfilled its duty under Article 63(9) with the minimal declaration. The Supreme Court held that Article 63(9) requires only a declaration under the Chairman's hand and seal stating the elected candidate, and does not mandate inclusion or simultaneous publication of detailed results. The Court further ruled that the plaintiffs' action was not an election petition under Article 64(1), so the 21-day challenge period did not apply. It emphasized that the validity of the election is distinct from the validity of the declaration, and that supporting evidence need only be available in the public domain, as ensured by Article 49. Thus, the Commission had constitutionally discharged its duty.",
