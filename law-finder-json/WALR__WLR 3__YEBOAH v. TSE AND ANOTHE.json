  "summary": "In this land dispute appeal before the High Court of Ghana, the plaintiff sought a declaration that a sale of land by his father to the defendants' predecessor was invalid under native custom. The Native Court had ruled in favor of the plaintiff, misplacing the burden of proof and accepting inadmissible evidence where the plaintiff's representative testified as if he were the plaintiff. The High Court, per Ollennu J., allowed the appeal, holding that the sale was valid under native custom due to sufficient publicity through witnesses, including a town chief. It further held that the land was self-acquired property of the plaintiff's father, freely alienable without family consent. Crucially, the matter was deemed res judicata based on a prior judgment in Yaw Wilson v. Tse, involving the same land, same defendants, and a plaintiff in privity (the plaintiff's uncle). The earlier judgment had upheld the sale's validity. The High Court found no admissible evidence supporting the plaintiff's claim and set aside the Native Court's decision.",
