  "caseTitle": "NII ODAI AYIKU IV v THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL & WOR-NII BORTELAB",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision addressed the jurisdictional limits of the High Court in chieftaincy matters. The appellant, Nii Odai Ayiku IV, sought declarations that Executive Instrument E.I. 18—prohibiting him from acting as Mantse of Nungua—was null and void, that it could not destool him without judicial process, and that he remained the lawful chief. A default judgment was entered in his favor when the Attorney-General failed to appear. However, Wor-Nii Bortelabi Borkety Laweh XIV, the current chief, successfully applied to set aside the judgment, arguing it affected his chieftaincy rights. The High Court and later the Court of Appeal upheld the setting aside, ruling the matter involved chieftaincy, over which the High Court lacked jurisdiction under Chieftaincy Act, 1971 (Act 370). The Supreme Court affirmed this, holding that the reliefs sought required determination of chieftaincy issues such as destoolment and rightful enstoolment, which are outside the High Court's jurisdiction. The Court emphasized that even void judgments may be challenged at any time by affected parties under established principles.",
