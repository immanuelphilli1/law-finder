  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF KODJO OYEMAN BROWN (DECEASED) AND IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION FOR L/A",
  "summary": "The Court of Appeal of Ghana dismissed an appeal concerning the distribution of the intestate estate of Kodjo Oyeman Brown, who died on 22nd February 1986, survived by three wives and twenty-one children. The appellant, Mercy Sagoe (a widow), challenged the trial judge's distribution of Plot No. 30 Korle Gonno, where she was allocated the 'outhouse' and Diana Appiah (another widow) the 'main house'. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in using alphabetical order to determine selection priority, failed to follow customary law favoring larger family groups, disregarded prior agreements, and allowed unjust enrichment from pre-distribution expenditures. The appellate court found no legal or factual error, noting both structures were of equal value, the distribution respected existing occupation, and the trial judge considered family agreements, prior possession, and statutory distribution ratios under PNDCL 111. The appeal was dismissed, upholding the trial court's equitable and fair distribution.",
