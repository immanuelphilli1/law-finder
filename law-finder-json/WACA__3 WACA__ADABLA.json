  "summary": "This appeal before the West African Court of Appeal arose from a judgment of the Paramount Chief's Tribunal at Ada, which non-suited the plaintiff. The plaintiff appealed directly to the Supreme Court, Eastern Province, without first applying to the Paramount Chief's Tribunal for leave to appeal, as required by section 77(1) of the Native Administration Ordinance (Cap. 111). The Court held that the proceedings before the Provincial Commissioner were a nullity due to non-compliance with the mandatory requirement of obtaining leave to appeal. The proviso added to section 77(2) by Ordinance No. 18 of 1935, which allows the West African Court of Appeal to exercise discretion in hearing appeals for substantial justice, was interpreted by the majority (Webber and Kingdon, C.JJ.) as applying only to subsection (2), not to subsection (1). Therefore, it could not cure the failure to seek leave under subsection (1). Petrides, C.J., dissented, arguing that the term 'this section' in the proviso should be given its ordinary meaning and extend to the entire section, allowing discretionary hearing of the appeal. The appeal was allowed, and the judgment of the High Native Tribunal of Ada was restored.",
