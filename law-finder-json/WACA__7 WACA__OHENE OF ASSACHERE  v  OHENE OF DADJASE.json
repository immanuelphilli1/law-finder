  "caseTitle": "OHENE OF ASSACHERE v OHENE OF DADJASE",
  "summary": "This 1941 West African Court of Appeal case involved a land title dispute between the Ohene of Assachere and the Ohene of Dadjase over land in Ashanti, Ghana. The Asantehene's Native Court 'A' divided the land between the two stools, citing justice and equity, after finding that while the plaintiff had some merit, he failed to fully prove his claim. The Court of Chief Commissioner affirmed this decision. On appeal, the West African Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. Although the court acknowledged that Exhibits 'I' and 'J' (Validated Executive Decisions) were binding under Chapter 120, Section 3(1), it held they did not apply because the appellant failed to establish their relevance to the disputed land. The appellant also failed to present these exhibits or related evidence in the Native Court. The appellate court found no error warranting re-trial, emphasizing finality in a dispute lasting twelve years. All three justices agreed the appeal should be dismissed, with some noting the Native Court’s judgment was inter partes and unconventional but acceptable given the circumstances.",
