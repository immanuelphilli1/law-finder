  "caseTitle": "FRIMPONG BADU VRS THE REPUBLIC, Criminal Appeal, SUIT NO.",
  "summary": "The appellant, Frimpong Badu, was convicted by the High Court for attempted exportation and possession of a narcotic drug (cocaine) without a licence or lawful authority, contrary to Sections 1(1) and 2(1) of PNDCL 236. He was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently. On appeal, he argued the trial court failed to consider his defence and selectively evaluated evidence. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, finding that the trial judge properly assessed all evidence and correctly concluded the appellant had both physical and constructive possession of the cocaine, with knowledge of its nature. The appellant's claim that the bag belonged to a third party (Kenny) and was to be delivered to another (Marvin) was rejected as implausible, especially given his retrieval of personal items (singlets, boxer shorts, socks) from the bag. The court affirmed that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and that the trial judge did not err in law or fact.",
