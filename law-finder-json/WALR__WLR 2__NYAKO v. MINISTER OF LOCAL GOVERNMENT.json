  "caseTitle": "ESSIEN VERSUS DUNCAN.",
  "summary": "In Essien v. Duncan, a 1956 Gold Coast Supreme Court case, the plaintiff claimed title to land originally owned by the defendant's family, who had conveyed it absolutely to a European, H. B. W. Russell, in 1893 and 1895. The land was later transferred to P. A. Renner in 1916, and in 1936, Renner gifted part of it to the plaintiff, who remained in possession until dispossessed in 1950. The defendant claimed reversion under native custom upon Russell’s death without heirs. The Municipal Court initially ruled for the defendant, citing lack of formal conveyance and escheat. On appeal, Ollennu J. held that the plaintiff had established title through long, undisturbed possession and corroborative evidence, including Renner’s letters. The court rejected the escheat argument, ruling that once land is alienated absolutely, the original family cannot reclaim it absent vacancy and abandonment, and that laches and equity barred the defendant’s claim after decades of acquiescence.",
