  "caseTitle": "GLADYS MENSAH VRS STEPHEN MENSAH",
  "summary": "In this 2012 Supreme Court of Ghana decision in Gladys Mensah v. Stephen Mensah, the court upheld the lower courts' rulings that marital property acquired during the subsistence of a customary and statutory marriage should be equitably distributed upon divorce. The petitioner, Gladys Mensah, had contributed significantly to the couple's business ventures, including trading in palm oil, rice, and other goods, while the respondent, Stephen Mensah, worked as an accounts officer. Despite the respondent's claim that the petitioner was a housewife who embezzled funds, the trial court found her testimony more credible, especially given contradictions in the respondent's evidence and that of his witnesses. The Supreme Court affirmed that under Article 22(3)(b) of the 1992 Constitution, jointly acquired assets must be distributed equitably, reinforcing the constitutional principle of gender equality in property rights. The court dismissed the appeal, finding no error in the evaluation of evidence or in the distribution of assets, including those tied to a limited liability company, as the business was funded by joint efforts. The judgment highlighted Parliament's unfulfilled obligation under Article 22(2) to enact specific legislation on spousal property rights.",
