  "caseTitle": "A.K.A IBOMAN VRS THE REPUBLIC",
  "summary": "The appellant, Kwaku Frimpong a.k.a Iboman, was convicted by the High Court for conspiracy to commit robbery and robbery, alongside three others, based on eyewitness testimony, a confession statement admitted after a mini-trial, and recovery of stolen property. The Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal, and he further appealed to the Supreme Court of Ghana. He challenged the evaluation of evidence, the admissibility of his confession, the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence, and the severity of his 65-year sentence with hard labour. The Supreme Court upheld the conviction, finding the prosecution had proven the essential elements of both offences beyond reasonable doubt, relying on credible eyewitness accounts, corroborative police investigation, and legally admissible confession. The court rejected arguments about missing witnesses and insufficient linkage, affirming that quality, not quantity, of evidence matters. The sentence was also upheld as proportionate to the gravity of the armed robbery.",
