  "caseTitle": "OKADJAKROM STOOL VERSUS ATONKOR STOOL AND OTHERS.",
  "summary": "The case involved a long-standing boundary dispute between the Okadjakrom Stool and the Atonkor Stool over land known as Kafetonku. In 1940, Atonkor sued Okadjakrom for trespass and a declaration that a 1922 compromise boundary (the 'purple line') was valid. The Native Court ruled in favor of Okadjakrom, allowing them to retain possession of the disputed land, but made no formal declaration of boundary or title. In 1951, Okadjakrom initiated a new action seeking a declaration of title, pleading res judicata based on the 1940 judgment. The Land Court upheld this plea, but the decision was appealed. The West African Court of Appeal held that the 1940 judgment did not constitute res judicata for title or boundary because the court had not adjudicated on ownership or formally declared a boundary. The absence of customary boundary rites and the subsequent attempts to demarcate confirmed that the issue remained unresolved. Thus, the plea of res judicata failed, and the appellant was not estopped from contesting title.",
