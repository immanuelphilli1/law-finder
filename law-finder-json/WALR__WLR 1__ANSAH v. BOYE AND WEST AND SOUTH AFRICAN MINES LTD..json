  "summary": "In Ansa v. Boye and West and South African Mines Ltd., the West African Court of Appeal considered whether an employer was vicariously liable for a driver's negligent collision occurring two hours after work ended and far from the designated route. The driver, instructed to garage his lorry after delivering manganese at 6 p.m., was involved in an accident at 8 p.m. while allegedly teaching someone to drive. The trial court found he was on a personal errand, thus absolving the employer. On appeal, the court emphasized that liability depends on whether the servant was acting within the scope of employment or on a 'frolic of his own.' While minor detours may not break the employment chain, a substantial deviation in time and route—especially for personal purposes—can. The court noted insufficient evidence to confirm the driver’s activities during the two-hour gap but highlighted that if he was merely taking a circuitous route, liability might still attach. However, embarking on a completely new journey for personal reasons would sever the employer's responsibility.",
