  "summary": "The appellant, Igwe, was convicted of murdering Onuoha Okorondu following a dispute over palm-nut harvesting on contested land. The trial judge rejected self-defence, but the West Africa Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, holding that the deceased initiated the attack with a machete, creating a life-threatening situation. After disarming the deceased, the appellant used the weapon to kill him. The appellate court found this act justified under section 286(2) of the Criminal Code as lawful self-defence, given the immediacy and severity of the threat, and quashed the conviction.",
