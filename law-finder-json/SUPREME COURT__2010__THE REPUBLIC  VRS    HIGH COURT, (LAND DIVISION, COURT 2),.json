  "caseTitle": "REPUBLIC VRS HIGH",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an application by Al-Hassan Limited for certiorari and prohibition against a High Court judge's ruling that set aside its supplementary affidavit in an interlocutory injunction motion. The applicant alleged a breach of natural justice, particularly the audi alteram partem principle, and judicial bias. The Supreme Court held that both parties had been heard before the ruling, and the judge acted within his discretionary powers under the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2004 (C.I. 47), Order 25 and Order 81. The Court emphasized that mere disagreement with a discretionary ruling does not constitute a breach of natural justice or justify certiorari. It reaffirmed that certiorari is not a substitute for appeal and is only granted for fundamental errors or jurisdictional defects. The applicant's proper remedy was appeal, not a prerogative writ. The application was dismissed, maintaining the distinction between appellate and supervisory jurisdiction.",
