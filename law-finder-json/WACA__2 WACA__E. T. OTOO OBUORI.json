  "caseTitle": "E. T. OTOO OBUORI",
  "summary": "This 1934 West Africa Court of Appeal decision addressed whether a judgment creditor could execute against the real property of a deceased debtor through an action against the administratrix of the estate. The plaintiff obtained a judgment against the defendant, Yar Borley, as administratrix of Bismarck Abbey-Quartey’s estate, for a debt owed by the deceased. Execution was attempted on the deceased’s real property, prompting an interpleader claim by A. B. Nartey. The court held that since the Letters of Administration granted only authority over the personal estate, the administratrix had no legal interest in the real property, and thus execution against such property was invalid. The court affirmed the lower court’s decision in favor of the claimant.",
