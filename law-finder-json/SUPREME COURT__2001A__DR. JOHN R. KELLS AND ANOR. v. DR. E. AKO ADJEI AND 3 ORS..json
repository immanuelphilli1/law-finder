  "caseTitle": "DR. JOHN R. KELLS AND ANOR. v. DR. E. AKO ADJEI AND 3 ORS.",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case involves a high-profile probate dispute over the estate of Dr. John Ackah Blay-Miezah, who died in 1992 leaving a contested will. Dr. John R. Kells claimed a 1989 will naming him as sole beneficiary and executor, while the deceased's family supported a 1988 will and alleged forgery. The High Court and Court of Appeal initially upheld the 1989 will, but the Supreme Court reviewed procedural irregularities, including the trial judge's conduct, jurisdictional overreach in taking evidence in London, and improper post-trial communications with a party. The case underscores the importance of strict adherence to pleadings, proper burden of proof in forgery allegations, and judicial impartiality in probate matters.",
