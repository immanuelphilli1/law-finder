  "caseTitle": "REX v STEPHEN OZEKWE OBIASE",
  "summary": "The appellant, Stephen Ozekwe Obiase, was convicted in the High Court for unlawful possession of thirteen counterfeit shillings under section 150A of the Criminal Code. The coins were found during a search for illicit liquor in a tin on a wall accessible from inside or outside the house. The appellant claimed the coins were planted by an enemy. The West Africa Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, holding that while section 150A places the burden on the accused to show lawful authority once possession is proved, the prosecution must first establish conclusive possession — that is, facts incompatible with any reasonable innocent explanation. The court found the evidence insufficient to conclusively prove the appellant's guilty knowledge or possession, as the possibility of the coins being planted remained viable. Thus, the conviction was unsafe, and the court ordered a verdict of acquittal.",
