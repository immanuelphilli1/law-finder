  "summary": "This document is a procedural guide by Da Rocha J. B. (SAG) on pre-trial matters under the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, LI 1129, in Ghana. It outlines key civil procedure principles including the proper joinder of parties, requirements for causes of action, and the role of persons under disability—such as infants or mentally incapacitated individuals—who must litigate through a next friend or guardian ad litem. The guide explains the issuance and service of writs, the necessity of appearance, and consequences of default. It also covers representative actions, third-party proceedings for indemnity or contribution, and the court's discretionary powers to manage cases fairly. The emphasis is on ensuring procedural correctness to avoid abuse of court processes and to uphold justice.",
