  "caseTitle": "SAMUEL BERVELL ACKAH v. EXPRESS MARITIME SERVICES",
  "summary": "This Court of Appeal ruling from Ghana addresses an application for a stay of execution of orders issued by the High Court, Tema, which had appointed a receiver/manager for Express Maritime Services Limited and restrained all four directors from acting as such. The Court of Appeal granted the stay, holding that the High Court's orders were improperly made. The plaintiff had not claimed the appointment of a receiver or an injunction against directors in his writ or statement of claim, and the Companies Code, Act 179, which governs the company, does not authorize such orders in the absence of a winding-up proceeding or a claim properly before the court. The Court emphasized that section 217 of Act 179 allows injunctions only against the company, not its directors, and section 237 applies only during winding up, which was not occurring. The appointment of the court registrar as receiver/manager of a specialized stevedoring company was also questioned due to lack of relevant expertise. The Court concluded that the High Court overstepped its discretion under Order 50 r.7 of the High Court Rules by not adhering to the statutory framework, and that the orders were executory and thus subject to a stay pending appeal.",
