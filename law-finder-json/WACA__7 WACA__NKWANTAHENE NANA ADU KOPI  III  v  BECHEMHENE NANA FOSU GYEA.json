  "caseTitle": "NKWANTAHENE NANA ADU KOPI III v BECHEMHENE NANA FOSU GYEA",
  "summary": "This is a land ownership dispute between Nkwantahene Nana Adu Kopi III and Bechemhene Nana Fosu Gyeabuor II over an area marked yellow in Exhibit \"B 1\". The Asantehene's Divisional Court \"B\" initially ruled in favor of the defendant, finding the 1913 agreement (Exhibit \"A\") did not cover the disputed southwestern area. On appeal, Court \"A\" reversed this decision based on inferences from Exhibit \"A\", which the West Africa Court of Appeal found unjustified. The Chief Commissioner's Court also erred by extending the 1913 agreement beyond its clear scope. The appellate court upheld Court \"B\"'s factual findings, which were based on a site visit and substantial evidence, and restored its judgment, declaring the disputed land belonged to Bechem. The appeal was allowed, prior judgments set aside, and costs awarded to the appellant.",
