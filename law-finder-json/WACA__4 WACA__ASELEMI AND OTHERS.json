  "summary": "This consolidated civil land dispute before the West Africa Court of Appeal involved rival claims by the people of Egdbema Adua and Emilagan over land in Emilagan, specifically areas named Obudual, Odum Idik, Edum Otu, and Osiji Oju. The trial judge had refused to grant a declaration of title due to the absence of a plan delineating boundaries, but nonetheless granted an injunction in favor of the plaintiffs-respondents. The appellate court held that the lack of precise boundaries rendered both the declaration and the injunction unenforceable. Citing Kerr on Injunction and Cather v. Midland Railway Co., the court emphasized that an injunction must clearly define what is prohibited to avoid legal uncertainty. Given that the land was historically common to both villages and no partition was proven, the court found insufficient evidence of exclusive title. Consequently, the appeal was allowed, the injunction was set aside, and a non-suit was entered in that regard. Costs in the lower court were to be borne by both parties, while the appellants were awarded costs on appeal.",
