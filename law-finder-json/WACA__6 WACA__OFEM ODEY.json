  "summary": "This case involved an application for an extension of time to file an appeal, which was initially misconceived as being directed to the West African Court of Appeal under Rule 15, though such applications should be made to the court below. Due to an error by the appellant's former legal practitioner, the appeal was not filed within the prescribed time. An earlier application to the lower court for extension was dismissed due to a misinterpretation of its powers under the rules. Citing the principle from Kojo Pon v. Atta Fua, the Court exercised its discretionary power under section 8 of the West African Court of Appeal Ordinance, 1933, to allow the appeal to proceed on the merits in the interest of substantial justice. The appellant was required to file the appeal within three days and serve the respondent, while also paying five guineas in costs within seven days as a condition for the appeal's acceptance.",
