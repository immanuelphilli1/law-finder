  "summary": "This is a civil land dispute before the Supreme Court of Ghana involving competing claims over land titles issued by the Asere Stool. The plaintiff sought to nullify the defendant's Land Title Certificate (No. GA3929) on grounds of fraud, while the defendant counterclaimed that the plaintiff's indenture was invalid. The High Court initially ruled for the plaintiff, but the Court of Appeal reversed it. The Supreme Court found that the plaintiff had conceded the lands were different, weakening her claim. It stressed the necessity of proper survey instructions when court-ordered surveys are conducted and held that the trial judge erred in relying on inconsistent size measurements. Ultimately, the Supreme Court allowed the appeal, finding the Court of Appeal's decision against the weight of evidence, and restored the High Court’s judgment in favor of the plaintiff.",
