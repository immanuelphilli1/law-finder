  "caseTitle": "In Allotey v. Quarcoo1 the",
  "summary": "This legal commentary examines the extent of judicial control over customary law family meetings in Ghana, focusing on Allotey v. Quarcoo, where a family head challenged his deposition by a family council. The Court of Appeal held that while families have broad autonomy in internal matters, courts may intervene where there is a complete or substantial denial of justice. A valid deposition requires a properly convened meeting with due notice, opportunity to be heard, and a decision by majority vote. Although courts generally defer to family decisions, they retain a supervisory role to ensure compliance with fundamental procedural fairness. The case affirms that while the merits of a family's decision are not reviewable unless pleaded, the procedural validity of the meeting and decision remains subject to judicial scrutiny. This principle distinguishes customary family governance from strictly non-justiciable statutory bodies, allowing limited but essential judicial oversight to uphold natural justice.",
