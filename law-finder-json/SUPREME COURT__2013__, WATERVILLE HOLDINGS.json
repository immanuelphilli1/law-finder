  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case arose from the government's failed procurement process for rehabilitating football stadia ahead of the 2008 African Cup of Nations. Waterville Holdings (BVI) Ltd, having been assigned rights by Vamed Engineering, entered into agreements with the Government of Ghana in April 2006 for the rehabilitation of Ohene Djan, El Wak, and Baba Yara stadia. However, these contracts contained conditions precedent—such as cabinet and parliamentary approval under Article 181(5) of the Constitution and establishment of an escrow account—that were never fulfilled, rendering the contracts ineffective. Despite this, the government allowed Waterville access to sites, where it performed demolition and site clearance. The government later terminated the agreements and transferred work to subcontractors, who compensated Waterville for certified work. Waterville then claimed additional pre-financing costs directly from the government. A third party, Alfred Woyome, claimed entitlement to compensation despite not being a contracting party. The court examined issues of contract formation, assignment, locus standi, and compliance with constitutional financial procedures.",

  "verdict": "The court held that the contracts were not legally enforceable due to unmet conditions precedent, particularly the absence of cabinet and parliamentary approval as required by Article 181(5) of the Constitution. While Waterville was entitled to compensation for work executed and certified by BIC, its broader claims for pre-financing costs failed due to the inchoate nature of the agreement. Third-party claims by Alfred Woyome were dismissed for lack of locus standi.",
