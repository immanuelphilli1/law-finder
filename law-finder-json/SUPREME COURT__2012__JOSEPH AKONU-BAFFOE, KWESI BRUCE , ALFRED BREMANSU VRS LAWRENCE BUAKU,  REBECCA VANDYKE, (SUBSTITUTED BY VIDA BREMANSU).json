  "summary": "This 2012 Supreme Court of Ghana decision involved a dispute over the validity of two wills executed by Thomas Kobina Bremansu in 1992 and 1995. The appellants, named as executors in the 1995 will, sought to revoke the probate granted under the 1992 will, while the respondents, executors under the 1992 will, counterclaimed that the 1995 will was not the testator's deed. The trial court and Court of Appeal upheld the 1992 will, citing suspicious circumstances around the 1995 will, including the testator's use of a thumbprint despite being able to sign his name and the absence of a jurat. The Supreme Court affirmed these findings, emphasizing that the appellants failed to discharge the burden of proving the 1995 will's validity, particularly in solemn form, and that the evidence did not support claims of fraud or invalidity of the 1992 will.",

    "The appellants failed to prove the 1995 will in solemn form, which was critical given the suspicious circumstances.",
    "The testator's use of a thumbprint on the 1995 will, despite being able to sign his name, raised suspicion.",
    "Absence of a jurat on the 1995 will undermined its validity, especially if the testator needed explanation of its contents.",
    "The trial court correctly found that ability to sign one's name does not equate to literacy.",
    "The respondents' failure to prove fraud did not shift the burden from the appellants to prove their will.",
    "Concurrent findings of fact by lower courts are not easily disturbed on appeal.",
    "Evidence showed the testator was literate enough to sign documents but sometimes used thumbprints, indicating possible partial illiteracy.",
    "The burden of proof remained on the appellants to establish the 1995 will's validity on balance of probabilities."
