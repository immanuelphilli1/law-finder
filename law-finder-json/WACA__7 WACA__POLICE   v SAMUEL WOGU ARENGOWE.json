  "caseTitle": "POLICE v SAMUEL WOGU ARENGOWE",
  "summary": "This 1941 West Africa Court of Appeal decision addressed whether a Magistrate's Court established under Ordinance No. 45 of 1933 had jurisdiction to hear a charge under section 22 of the Medical Practitioners and Dentists Ordinance No. 20 of 1934. The accused, Samuel Wogu Arengowe, initially pleaded guilty before a Magistrate who believed he lacked jurisdiction and remitted the case to the Supreme Court. A direction under section 10(3) of the Protectorate Courts Ordinance led to the case being assigned to a Supreme Court Judge in Lagos. A plea of autrefois convict was raised, referencing R v. Chinaka (1937), where it was previously held that Magistrates lacked such jurisdiction. The Appeal Court rejected this reasoning, clarifying that a Magistrate's original jurisdiction is statutory and independent of the High Court's appellate jurisdiction. The Court held that section 33 of the Protectorate Courts Ordinance, as amended, granted Magistrates authority over summary criminal trials, and no provision excluded offences under section 22 of Ordinance No. 20 of 1934. Thus, the Court affirmed that Magistrates did have jurisdiction.",
