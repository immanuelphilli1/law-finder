  "caseTitle": "MISCELLANY-AT-LAW THE LATE MRS. JUSTICE CECILIA KORANTENG-AD",
  "summary": "The 1982 abduction and murder of three Ghanaian High Court judges—Mrs. Cecilia Koranteng-Addow, Mr. Justice Fred Poku Sarkodie, and Mr. Justice Kwadwo Agyei Agyepong—and retired army officer Major Sam Acquah shocked the nation and halted judicial operations temporarily. The Provisional National Defence Council (P.N.D.C.), led by Flt.-Lt. J. J. Rawlings, condemned the acts and established the Special Investigations Board (S.I.B.) under Justice Azu Crabbe to investigate. The S.I.B. report implicated ten individuals, including Captain Kojo Tsikata (Rtd.), Sgt. Alolga Akata-Pore, and Joachim Amartey Kwei in the conspiracy. However, the Attorney-General only prosecuted five, citing insufficient evidence against the other five. Five individuals were tried before a public tribunal: Joachim Amartey Kwei, L./Cpl. Michael Senya, Johnny Dzandu, Tonny Tekpor, and S.K. Amedeka. All were convicted and sentenced to death by firing squad; some were executed in August 1983. The case triggered national and international condemnation and raised serious concerns about judicial independence, rule of law, and state accountability during Ghana’s revolutionary period.",
