  "summary": "This appeal from the Ghana Court of Appeal concerns a dispute over the ownership and nature of a property transaction involving Plot No. 17, Block 111, Ampabame, Kumasi. The appellants claimed the property was family land acquired by Kwame Appiah and developed by Akwasi Obeng, and that Obeng only pledged it to the respondents, not sold it. They sought recovery upon repayment of the pledge sum. The respondents asserted an outright purchase from Obeng, claiming it as his self-acquired property. The trial court dismissed the appellants' claim, declaring the first respondent an equitable owner. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's finding that the property was Obeng's self-acquired asset, not family property, emphasizing that contributions by family members were insufficient to establish family character. It further held that the appellants failed to prove the transaction was a pledge, noting the improbability of a pledge involving an uncompleted structure and Obeng's lifelong failure to redeem it. The appeal was dismissed.",
