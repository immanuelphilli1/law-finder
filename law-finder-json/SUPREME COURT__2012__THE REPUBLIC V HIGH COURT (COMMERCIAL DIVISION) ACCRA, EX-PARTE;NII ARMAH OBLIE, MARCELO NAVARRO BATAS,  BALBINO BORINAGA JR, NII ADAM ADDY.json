  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC V HIGH COURT (COMMERCIAL DIVISION) ACCRA, EX-PARTE;NII ARMAH OBLIE, MARCELO NAVARRO BATAS, BALBINO BORINAGA JR, NII ADAM ADDY",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana issued a ruling in an ex-parte application for a writ of certiorari to quash proceedings and orders of the High Court (Commercial Division), including the committal of Nii Armah Oblie to prison for 60 days for non-compliance with an order to transfer company funds from his personal account to the corporate account. The Court held that although the order involved money, it was a specific ministerial act—issuing a cheque to re-deposit funds—and not an open-ended judgment for payment of money. Relying on Republic v High Court, Ex parte PPE Ltd & Paul Juric (2007-2008) SCGLR 188 and Order 43 Rule 12(1) of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2004 (C.I. 47), the Court ruled that committal for contempt was not a permissible enforcement mechanism for orders involving the payment of money, as such enforcement risks violating personal liberty. The Court emphasized the mischief rule in statutory interpretation, noting that the omission of committal in money-related orders was intended to prevent imprisonment for debt. It distinguished the case from traditional debt enforcement, finding the act required was mechanical and specific, akin to returning a chattel. Consequently, the committal order was quashed, reinforcing constitutional protections against arbitrary detention in civil matters.",
