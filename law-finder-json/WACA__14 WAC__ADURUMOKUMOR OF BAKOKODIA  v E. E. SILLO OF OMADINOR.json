  "caseTitle": "ADURUMOKUMOR OF BAKOKODIA v E. E. SILLO OF OMADINOR",
  "summary": "This civil appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal arose from a land dispute transferred from a Native Court to the Supreme Court. The plaintiffs, E. E. Sillo and others representing the people of Omadinor, sued the defendant, Adurumokumor of Bakokodia, for a declaration of title and damages for trespass. The defendant appealed after losing at trial, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked court approval to sue in a representative capacity under Order 4, Rule 3 of the Supreme Court (Civil Procedure) Rules. The Court held that since the suit originated in a Native Court not bound by those rules, the transfer did not invalidate the plaintiffs' representative standing, especially as the defendant had admitted the representative capacities in his pleadings. The Court also rejected a challenge to the land plan, noting the disputed area was identifiable despite a clerical error in marking. Lastly, it upheld the award of damages, ruling that the defendant and his community were collectively liable for the trespass. The appeal was dismissed with a rider added to clarify that the judgment does not prejudice future boundary determinations with neighboring communities.",
