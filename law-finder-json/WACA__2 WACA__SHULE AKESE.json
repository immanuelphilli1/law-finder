  "caseTitle": "SHULE AKESE",
  "summary": "This 1935 West African Court of Appeal decision arose from a case originally heard in the Native Court of Calabar, where judgment was awarded to plaintiff Shule Akese against defendant Fatumo. The judgment was later reviewed and modified by the District Officer. The Resident of Calabar Province initially transferred the case to the Magistrate's Court under section 25(1)(c) of the Native Courts Ordinance (Cap. 5), then amended the order to transfer it to the High Court. The Chief Judge, uncertain about the legality and effect of the amended transfer order, referred two questions to the appellate court: (1) whether the amended transfer order was legal and valid, and (2) its legal effect. The court held that the Resident had the authority under section 25(4) to amend the transfer order within one month, making it valid. However, it ruled that transferring a case after final judgment had no legal effect because the proceedings had concluded and no rehearing could be implied.",
