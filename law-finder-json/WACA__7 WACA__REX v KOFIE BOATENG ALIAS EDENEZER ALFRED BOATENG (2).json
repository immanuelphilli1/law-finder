  "caseTitle": "REX v KOFIE BOATENG ALIAS EDENEZER ALFRED BOATENG (2)",
  "summary": "In this 1941 West Africa Court of Appeal case from Accra, Kofie Boateng (also known as Edenezer Alfred Boateng) appealed his conviction for receiving stolen goods—specifically a bottle of whisky and a tin of sardines—arising from a burglary charge of which he was acquitted. The court held that the sentence of two years' hard labour was excessive given that the items were not proven to be proceeds of the burglary. More significantly, the court found that the trial judge misdirected the jury by suggesting that the appellant's pre-arrest silence could serve as corroboration of the first accused's allegations. The appellate judges emphasized that silence alone, especially before formal arrest, cannot constitute valid corroboration without proper context or explanation. Because this misdirection concerned a vital point in the trial, the court allowed the appeal, quashed both conviction and sentence, and substituted a judgment of acquittal. The appellant was discharged. The decision underscores the importance of accurate jury instructions, particularly regarding the right to silence and the rules of corroboration in criminal trials.",
