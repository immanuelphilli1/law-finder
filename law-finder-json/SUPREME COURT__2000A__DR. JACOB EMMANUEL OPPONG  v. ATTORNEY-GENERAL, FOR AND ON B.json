  "caseTitle": "DR. JACOB EMMANUEL OPPONG v. ATTORNEY-GENERAL, FOR AND ON B",
  "summary": "In Dr. Jacob Emmanuel Oppong v. Attorney-General & Others, the Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed the plaintiff's action due to non-compliance with procedural rules under C.I. 16. The plaintiff filed an affidavit and statement of case on 14 September 1999 without a writ, which is mandatory under Rule 45(1). Although a writ was later filed on 30 September 1999, the plaintiff failed to file a statement of case within the 14-day period required by Rule 46(1), nor did he apply for an extension under Rule 48(4). The court held that the initial filings were nullities and could not be validated by attaching them to a later writ. The defendants' preliminary objection was upheld, and the action was struck out for procedural non-compliance, emphasizing that fundamental defects in procedure cannot be waived and that strict adherence to rules ensures the efficient administration of justice.",
