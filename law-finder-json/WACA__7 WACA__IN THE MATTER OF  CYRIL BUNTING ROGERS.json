  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF CYRIL BUNTING ROGERS",
  "summary": "This 1941 West Africa Court of Appeal decision addressed an appeal by Cyril Bunting Rogers Wright, a legal practitioner whose name was struck off the Sierra Leone Supreme Court roll by the Acting Chief Justice for professional misconduct. The misconduct included charging an improper 10% commission on a recovered sum after already being paid a fixed fee, deducting unauthorized costs, and proposing a champertous agreement to share equally in the proceeds of a speculative lawsuit with his client. The court upheld the finding of misconduct, confirming that the Acting Chief Justice had jurisdiction under Section 53 of the Supreme Court Ordinance, 1932, and that the agreement was indeed champertous. However, it found the penalty of being struck off the roll excessive and substituted a one-year suspension, with part of the period already served counting toward the suspension. The appellant had expressed regret and refunded the disputed amounts.",
