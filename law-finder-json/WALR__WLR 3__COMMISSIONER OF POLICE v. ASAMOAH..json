  "caseTitle": "COMMISSIONER OF POLICE VERSUS ASAMOAH.",
  "summary": "The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal against a conviction by a Magistrate who failed to record reasons for the decision. The court emphasized that under section 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code, reasons must be recorded in all conviction cases unless the basis for conviction is clearly obvious and beyond doubt from the facts. Relying on Atunde v. Commissioner of Police (1952), the court held that the absence of recorded reasons impedes appellate review and violates the public's right to understand judicial decisions, especially in criminal cases. Since the trial magistrate provided no reasoning and the appellate court could not infer any, the conviction was quashed and the appellant acquitted.",
