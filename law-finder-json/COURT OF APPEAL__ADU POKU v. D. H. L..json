  "caseTitle": "POKU v. D. H. L.",
  "summary": "This civil appeal arose from a dispute over the jurisdiction of the Ghanaian courts in a contract of carriage case between Ex-Warrant Officer Adu Poku (plaintiff) and D.H.L. (defendant), a London-based company. The plaintiff obtained leave to serve the writ out of jurisdiction, which the defendant sought to set aside, arguing that the proper law of the contract was English law and that England was the appropriate forum. The High Court dismissed the application, but the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal. It held that the trial judge erred in ruling the application out of time, clarifying that legal vacation periods do not count under Order 64 Rule 4 and that Order 12 Rule 24 permits conditional appearance without a strict 14-day deadline. Substantively, the Court found that the contract was formed, breached, and governed by English law, with all relevant events occurring in London. The plaintiff's return to Ghana did not alter the jurisdictional analysis. The affidavit supporting the service application was deemed insufficient for lacking a full and frank disclosure of key facts. The Court concluded that Ghana was not the appropriate forum and that the lower court lacked jurisdiction.",
