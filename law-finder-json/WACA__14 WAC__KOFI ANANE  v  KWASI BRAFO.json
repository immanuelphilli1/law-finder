  "caseTitle": "KOFI ANANE v KWASI BRAFO",
  "summary": "This 1952 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Kofi Anane v. Kwasi Brafo addresses jurisdictional limits between the Supreme Court and Native Courts in Ashanti, Ghana, concerning succession disputes. The appellant, Kofi Anane, obtained letters of administration for the estate of Kwaku Sampaney (alias Kwasi Brafo) and sued the respondent to recover personal property, claiming both as administrator and as successor under native customary law. The trial court halted proceedings, referring the matter to the Native Court under section 35 of the Native Courts (Ashanti) Ordinance, which grants Native Courts jurisdiction over succession matters. The appellant argued that his grant of administration established his status as successor and that the Supreme Court had concurrent jurisdiction under section 14 of the Courts Ordinance. The appellate court rejected this, affirming that a grant of administration does not equate to being the customary law successor and that disputes over succession must be resolved by Native Courts. The appeal was dismissed, upholding the principle that even where jurisdiction exists, the Supreme Court must refrain from exercising it in civil matters falling under Native Court jurisdiction per section 17 of the Courts Ordinance.",
