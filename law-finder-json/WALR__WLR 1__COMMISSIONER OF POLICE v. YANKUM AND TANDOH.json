  "summary": "In Commissioner of Police v. Yankum and Tandoh, the West African Court of Appeal upheld the power of an appellate court to alter a conviction to a cognate, lesser offense under section 333(1)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Code, provided the accused had the opportunity to defend against the substituted charge. The appellants were originally convicted under sections 372 and 170(1) of the Criminal Code for obstructing and assaulting a public officer, but the Divisional Court substituted convictions under section 21(3) of the Native Courts (Colony) Ordinance for assaulting or obstructing a Native Court bailiff. The appeal challenged the appellate court's authority to make such a substitution. The Court held that such power is permissible when the offense is cognate, not more serious, and within the original court’s jurisdiction, and when the accused is not prejudiced. It emphasized that the alteration must not amount to a new or distinct charge. The appeals were dismissed, affirming the substituted convictions.",
