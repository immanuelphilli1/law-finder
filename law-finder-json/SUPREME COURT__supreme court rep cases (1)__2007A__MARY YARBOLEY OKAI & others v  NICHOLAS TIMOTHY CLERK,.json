  "summary": "This 2007 Supreme Court of Ghana case (Civil Appeal No. J4/5/2007) involved a property dispute over a house originally owned by Mark George Okai, who died intestate in 1939. His daughters leased the property to Nicholas Timothy Clerk in 1945 for 60 years. Clerk failed to comply with a West African Court of Appeal (WACA) order to demolish and rebuild the structure, and ceased rent payments in 1964. In 1983, Okai’s surviving children sued for arrears, mesne profits, and forfeiture. Clerk’s successors claimed he acquired the property via auction sale in 1952 and subsequent resale, but this defense was rejected as an afterthought inconsistent with Clerk’s original pleadings, where he acknowledged the lease and even paid rent into court. The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts’ rulings, affirming the lease’s forfeiture due to non-compliance with the WACA order and invalidity of the alleged auction sale, which lacked proper family consent and was ethically flawed.",
