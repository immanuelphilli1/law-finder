  "caseTitle": "PRECLUDING ORDER 14 JUDGMENT WITH A COUNTERCLAIM [1981 & 82]",
  "summary": "This legal commentary examines whether a defendant can prevent summary judgment under Order 14 of the Rules of Court by raising a counterclaim that exceeds but is unrelated to the plaintiff's claim. It analyzes two key Ghanaian cases: Inspector-Plastico Moulds Ltd. v. Atico Ltd., where Amissah J.A. granted summary judgment despite a larger counterclaim, and Accra Furniture and Rubber Foam Co., Ltd. v. Indart S.P./A. of Rome, where the Court of Appeal set aside summary judgment, citing a plausible counterclaim for breach of contract. The author argues that the latter decision does not necessarily overturn the former, emphasizing that equitable set-off requires a connection between claims. The piece clarifies that while every set-off is a counterclaim, not every counterclaim qualifies as a set-off, and procedural fairness must balance judicial efficiency against the risk of injustice.",

    "Summary judgment under Order 14 should not be precluded solely because a defendant raises a larger, unrelated counterclaim.",
    "A counterclaim may act as a defence only if it is connected to the plaintiff's claim or falls within equitable set-off principles.",
    "The Court of Appeal in Accra Furniture case set aside summary judgment due to a plausible, albeit unproven, counterclaim in breach of contract.",
    "Affidavit evidence can establish claims under Order 14, and similarly, a defendant may seek summary judgment on a counterclaim under Order 14, r.12."
