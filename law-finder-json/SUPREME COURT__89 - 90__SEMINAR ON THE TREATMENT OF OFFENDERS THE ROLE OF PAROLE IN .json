  "caseTitle": "SEMINAR ON THE TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS THE ROLE OF PAROLE IN",
  "summary": "This 1989–90 legal paper by Danyagre J.S. examines the role of parole in Ghana's criminal justice system, advocating for community-based corrections as a humane, reformative, and cost-effective alternative to prolonged incarceration. The author critiques Ghana’s colonial-era prison system, highlighting overcrowding, the high human and fiscal costs of imprisonment, and the criminogenic effects of prisons. Parole is presented as a rehabilitative tool that allows eligible prisoners—those who have served one-third of their sentence or six months, whichever is longer—to be released under supervision. The process involves a local review committee and a Parole Board composed of judicial, psychiatric, and criminological experts. Parole decisions consider conduct, social background, and reintegration prospects. Conditions include reporting to probation officers and maintaining lawful behavior, with revocation possible for non-compliance. The paper emphasizes that parole reduces prison burdens, promotes rehabilitation, and aligns with international critiques of incarceration.",
