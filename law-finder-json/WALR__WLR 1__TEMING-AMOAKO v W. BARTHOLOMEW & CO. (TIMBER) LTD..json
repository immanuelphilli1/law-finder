  "caseTitle": "TEMING-AMOAKO v W. BARTHOLOMEW & CO. (TIMBER) LTD.",
  "summary": "This 1955 Gold Coast (now Ghana) Supreme Court decision concerns a contractual dispute over the supply of timber logs from the Numia Forest Reserve. The defendant company, W. Bartholomew & Co. (Timber) Ltd., had agreed to supply the plaintiff, Teming-Amoako, with 48 exportable logs monthly—24 mahogany and 24 secondary species—for six months, in exchange for felling rights. Although the defendants harvested 65 mahogany and 143 other logs, they delivered only 31 and 48 respectively, claiming insufficient supply under their forestry permit. The trial court awarded nominal damages of £100, but the appellate court found that while performance was partially frustrated due to impossibility, the defendants remained obligated to deliver all logs they were able to obtain. The appeal was allowed, damages were increased to £2,949 15s, and costs were awarded to the plaintiff.",
