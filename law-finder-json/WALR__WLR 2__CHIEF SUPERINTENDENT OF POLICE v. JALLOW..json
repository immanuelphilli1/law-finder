  "caseTitle": "CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE VERSUS JALLOW.",
  "summary": "In Chief Superintendent of Police v. Jallow, the appellant was charged with burglary and stealing but convicted of retaining stolen property under section 297(1) of the Criminal Code. The West African Court of Appeal held that retaining and receiving stolen property are distinct offences, with retaining applying when stolen property is innocently received but kept after discovering its stolen nature. The court ruled that section 156(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code allows conviction for receiving when charged with stealing, but does not permit conviction for retaining, making the original conviction legally invalid. Given sufficient evidence for receiving, the court substituted the conviction accordingly while maintaining the sentence.",
