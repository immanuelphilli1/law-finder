  "caseTitle": "JOHN K. A KLU v MAVIS DARKO & DR. KOFI KONADU APRAKU",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana restored the trial court's judgment in favor of the plaintiff, John K. A. Klu, in a land dispute against Mavis Darko and Dr. Kofi Konadu Apraku. The plaintiff had been in continuous and undisturbed possession of Plot No. 234, Block 8, Section 114, La-Bawaleshi (East Legon) since 1980. Although the Court of Appeal had reversed the trial court on the basis that the plaintiff's title was invalid due to the prior destoolment of the Nungua Mantse who granted the land to his vendor (nemo dat quod non habet), the Supreme Court held that the plaintiff's adverse possession for over 12 years under Section 10 of the Limitation Decree, 1972 (NRCD 54), conferred a valid possessory title. This title was protected even against registered interests under Section 18 of the Land Title Registration Law, 1986 (PNDCL 152). The defendants' claim was found to be a simulated transaction based on false evidence. The Supreme Court emphasized that the original stool's title had been extinguished, and the plaintiff's prior possession rendered him the rightful owner. The appeal was allowed, the Court of Appeal's decision set aside, and the trial court's reliefs reinstated.",
