  "caseTitle": "STANDARD CHARTERED BANK GHANA LTD. VRS WESTERN HARDWOOD LTD",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an application by Standard Chartered Bank Ghana Ltd. to suspend the Court of Appeal's conditional order for stay of execution and to stay enforcement of the High Court's judgment. The bank had lost at the High Court, which awarded Gh\u0003300,000 in damages and Gh\u00036,000 in costs to Western Hardwood Ltd. Upon appeal, the Court of Appeal ordered the bank to pay half the judgment debt (Gh\u0003150,000) as a condition for staying execution. The bank then applied to the Supreme Court to reverse that order, arguing that the respondents were impecunious and unable to refund the sum if the appeal succeeded. The Supreme Court held that it lacked jurisdiction to intervene because the applicant had not first reapplied to the Court of Appeal after appealing, as required by rule 20(2) of the Supreme Court Rules, 1996 (CI 16). The Court emphasized that a judgment confirmed on appeal remains the order of the lower court and is not subject to stay by the appellate court. It also explicitly overruled the precedent in NDK Financial Services Ltd v Yiadom Construction & Electrical Works [2007-2008] 1 SCGLR 93, reaffirming that only the originating court can enforce or stay its own judgment. The application was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.",
