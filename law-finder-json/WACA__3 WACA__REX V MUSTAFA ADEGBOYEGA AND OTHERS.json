  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of Mustafa Adegboyega and others, quashing their convictions for coining offences under sections 148(3)(c), 148(3)(d), and 152(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellants were charged with possession of counterfeit silver coins, a mould, and coining tools at Otu-Jeremi on 8 November 1936. The court found that the prosecution failed to call four witnesses who had testified at the preliminary inquiry, contrary to the established practice requiring material witnesses to be made available for cross-examination. Additionally, the court ruled that evidence of a bundle of counterfeiting materials (Ex. 'A') seized at Otan on 7 November was irrelevant and prejudicial, as there was no sufficient connection between the accused and that seizure. Although the court accepted that the appellant was likely present at the Otu-Jeremi raid, it held that the evidence did not sufficiently prove he controlled the room where the apparatus was found. Consequently, the convictions were overturned due to insufficient evidence and procedural unfairness.",
