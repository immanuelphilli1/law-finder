  "caseTitle": "NAOS HOLDING INC. v GHANA COMMERCIAL BANK",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed the appeal filed by Naos Holding Inc., a foreign entity claiming to be incorporated in Panama, against Ghana Commercial Bank. The appellant had initiated proceedings to declare itself a holder in due course of certain promissory notes guaranteed by the respondent. The respondent challenged the appellant's legal existence and capacity to sue, citing non-disclosure of its foreign address in the writ as required under Order 3 Rule 4 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules. The High Court and Court of Appeal both held the writ to be a nullity due to non-compliance and lack of evidence of corporate existence. The Supreme Court affirmed this, ruling that the Power of Attorney presented was insufficient to prove legal personality, and the appellant failed to provide essential documents like a certificate of incorporation. The court emphasized that a foreign plaintiff must disclose its residence and that failure to do so, coupled with inability to prove corporate status, justified dismissal.",
