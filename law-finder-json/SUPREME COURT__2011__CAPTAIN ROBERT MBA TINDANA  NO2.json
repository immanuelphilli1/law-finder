  "caseTitle": "CAPTAIN ROBERT MBA TINDANA NO2",
  "summary": "Captain Robert Mba Tindana, a former military officer discharged after alleged misconduct during peacekeeping operations, filed a High Court action in 2007 challenging his discharge as a violation of the Armed Forces Act and his fundamental rights. The High Court dismissed the suit due to the Limitation Act and constitutional transitional provisions. The Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal on merits, but the Supreme Court later set aside that decision, ruling the appeal was filed out of time without extension, rendering it incompetent and stripping the Court of Appeal of jurisdiction. Tindana then applied for a review of the Supreme Court’s judgment, arguing procedural fairness, waiver of delay, and substantive human rights issues. The Supreme Court dismissed the review application, affirming that jurisdictional defects based on untimely appeals cannot be waived and that courts must uphold statutory time limits to preserve the rule of law.",
