  "caseTitle": "CAPTAIN ROBERT MBA TINDANA VRS THE CHIEF OF DEFENCE STAFF, THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE ,THE ATTORNEY GENERAL",
  "summary": "Captain Robert Mba Tindana, a military officer, brought an action under Article 33 of the 1992 Constitution seeking a declaration that his release from active service by the Chief of Defence Staff, Minister of Defence, and Attorney General breached the Armed Forces Act, 1962 (Act 105) and Armed Forces Regulations. The case was initiated via an originating notice of motion. However, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal as incompetent because it was filed after the three-month limitation period under Rule 9 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The Court held that it lacked jurisdiction over a time-barred appeal, rendering the entire proceeding a nullity. Citing AkufFo-Addo v Cathleen, the Court determined that no further hearing was necessary on the procedural defect as it was a clear and unanswerable jurisdictional issue. Consequently, the appeal was struck out without consideration of the constitutional merits.",
