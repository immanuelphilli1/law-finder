  "caseTitle": "F. & M. KHOURY",
  "summary": "This consolidated interpleader appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal concerned competing claims over the assets of judgment-debtor Najib Teymani. The appellants, F. & M. Khoury, challenged the validity and interpretation of a Letter of Hypothecation (Exhibit A) granted by Teymani to Adolphus Beer & Co. on 23rd March 1939, and the priority of a subsequent Bill of Sale granted to A. G. Leventis & Co. The Court upheld the lower court's finding that Exhibit A was a valid document, not a bill of sale under the 1854 Act, as it constituted an assignment for the benefit of all creditors. It was construed as creating a trust requiring pro rata and pari passu distribution of the goods or their proceeds among all of Teymani's creditors. The subsequent Bill of Sale to Leventis & Co. could not prejudice other creditors and did not confer priority. The Court also confirmed that Khoury's attachment of goods, including those previously pledged, fell within the trust's ambit as their possession was deemed that of the judgment-debtor. The lower court's error in limiting the trust beneficiaries to judgment creditors was corrected, and the judgment was varied to ensure all proven creditors would share equally. The appellants were barred from raising a new factual point on appeal.",

  "verdict": "The appeal was allowed in part. The judgment of the lower court was upheld regarding the validity and construction of the Letter of Hypothecation but varied to correct the error in limiting distribution to judgment creditors only. The claim of Leventis & Co. based on the subsequent Bill of Sale was subordinated to the trust created by Exhibit A.",
  "winningSide": "F. & M. Khoury (appellants) partially, as the Court corrected the lower court's error in favor of broader creditor rights, though the core validity of the trust benefiting Beer & Co. and all creditors was upheld against Khoury's exclusive claim.",
