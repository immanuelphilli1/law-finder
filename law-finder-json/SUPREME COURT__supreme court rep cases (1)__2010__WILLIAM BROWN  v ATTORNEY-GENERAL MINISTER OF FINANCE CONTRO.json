  "caseTitle": "WILLIAM BROWN v ATTORNEY-GENERAL MINISTER OF FINANCE CONTRO",
  "summary": "In William Brown v Attorney-General, Minister of Finance & Controller and Accountant-General (2010), the plaintiff, a retired Deputy Auditor-General and President of the Audit Service Pensioners Association, challenged several financial practices affecting the Ghana Audit Service. He argued that the Minister of Finance’s review and downward adjustment of the Audit Service’s administrative estimates—including salaries, allowances, pensions, and gratuities—before submission to Parliament violated constitutional provisions guaranteeing financial autonomy. The Supreme Court held that under Articles 178(1)(a), 179(2)(b), 187(14), and 189(3) of the 1992 Constitution, administrative expenses of the Audit Service are a direct charge on the Consolidated Fund, determined solely by the Audit Service Board in consultation with the Public Services Commission, and are not subject to executive review, parliamentary approval, or budgetary ceilings. The Court further ruled that requiring financial clearance for recruitment or payroll placement was unconstitutional, and that paying pensions via the Social Security Fund instead of the Consolidated Fund violated the Constitution. The decision affirmed the financial independence of constitutionally established bodies essential to checks and balances.",
