  "caseTitle": "REGINA v KOFI ANTWI",
  "summary": "The appellant, Kofi Antwi, was convicted of murder for his role in an unlawful assembly at the Krontihene's premises, where a man was killed by an unknown shooter during a violent confrontation. The court applied Section 47(2) of the Criminal Code, 1951, holding that anyone who abets a riot with knowledge that unlawful violence is intended or likely is guilty of abetting any violence committed in executing the purpose of the assembly. Despite an alibi defense, the trial judge relied on police constable Boateng's testimony identifying the appellant as armed and present, intending to shoot. The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, finding sufficient independent corroboration in Boateng's account, distinguishing the appellant's case from the thirteen co-accused who were acquitted due to lack of reliable evidence. The appeal was dismissed.",
