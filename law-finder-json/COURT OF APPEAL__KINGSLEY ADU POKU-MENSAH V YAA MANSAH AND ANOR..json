  "caseTitle": "KINGSLEY ADU POKU-MENSAH V YAA MANSAH AND ANOR.",
  "summary": "This appeal arose from a civil action where Kingsley Adu Poku-Mensah, as customary successor, sought a declaration of his maternal family's title to a property in Kumasi, recovery of possession, accounting of rents, and a perpetual injunction against the defendants. The defendants, including the widow and children of the deceased prior occupant, claimed an inter vivos gift of the property based on payment of GHS 100,000 and schnapps as 'Aseda' at a funeral rite. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial court's judgment in favor of the plaintiff, affirming that the defendants failed to prove the alleged gift, particularly given the implausibility of such a large sum under 1977 economic conditions. The court confirmed the plaintiff's capacity to sue as the duly appointed customary successor, relying on Akan customary law and precedents like Kwan vrs. Nyieni and Amponsah vrs. Kwa Tia. It emphasized that the burden of proof in title disputes rests on the plaintiff, who must establish a credible case, and that weakness in the defendant's case alone cannot sustain relief unless the plaintiff first makes out a prima facie claim.",
