  "caseTitle": "ARTHUR v. JOHN HECTOR ANSAH & NAOMI OWUSU",
  "summary": "In Ruth Arthur v. John Hector Ansah & Naomi Owusu, the Ghanaian Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's ruling that a customary marriage between Ruth Arthur and John Hector Ansah remained legally valid and subsisting despite a subsequent ordinance marriage between Ansah and Naomi Owusu in 1998. The court found that the customary marriage had not been properly dissolved according to Akan customary law, which requires a formal process involving both families, libation, and the application of kaolin. The appellant failed to provide satisfactory evidence that these procedures were followed. Although the parties had separated and lived apart for years, the court emphasized that legal dissolution requires adherence to prescribed formalities. The ordinance marriage was declared null and void, and the appeal was dismissed, affirming that a marriage cannot be dissolved informally or by mere abandonment.",
