  "caseTitle": "AMPIAH KOKO IV AND EB. YAW ABUENI v. EB. KWESI NYARKOH",
  "summary": "This is an appeal from a Circuit Court ruling that refused the plaintiffs leave to amend their writ of summons and statement of claim during trial in a land dispute over the Kyekyegya area in Agona Nyakrom, Ghana. The plaintiffs sought to clarify and alter the boundaries of the disputed land, claiming declaration of title, ejectment, damages for trespass, and a perpetual injunction. The defendants opposed the amendment, arguing it would cause prejudice, require new evidence, and amount to a new case. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge's refusal, emphasizing that while courts are generally liberal in allowing amendments to determine the real issue between parties, such amendments must not cause injustice, surprise, or undue delay. The proposed amendment would have drastically changed the described boundaries, retroactively affecting already-given evidence and necessitating recall of witnesses, thus prejudicing the defendants. The appeal was dismissed.",
