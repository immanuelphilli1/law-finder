  "caseTitle": "FISCIAN VERSUS TETTER",
  "summary": "This 1956 West African Court of Appeal decision in Fiscian v. Tetter addressed a land title dispute involving the Aruna family and the Brazilian community in Accra, Ghana. The plaintiff, Fiscian, sought a declaration of title to land previously litigated in Joseph Tetteh v. Anna Tetteh, where the defendant (Tetter) had successfully obtained title against Anna Tetteh, a grantee of the Aruna family. The court held that the Aruna family was estopped from re-litigating the title because their interest had been put in issue in the prior suit, even though they were not formal parties. The refund of purchase money to Anna Tetteh did not revive the family's right to sue. The court emphasized that under native customary law, a grantor may be bound by litigation involving their grantee when the title derived from them is challenged. The judgment also included obiter dicta on land tenure among the Brazilian community, noting that original title vested in the community as a whole under Ga customary law, with individual possessory rights arising through occupation and approval by community elders.",
