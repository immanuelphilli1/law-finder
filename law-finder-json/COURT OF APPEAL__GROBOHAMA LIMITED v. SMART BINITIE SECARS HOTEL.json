  "caseTitle": "GROBOHAMA LIMITED v. SMART BINITIE SECARS HOTEL",
  "summary": "In this Ghanaian civil appeal, Grobohama Limited (respondent) sued Smart Binitie Secars Hotel (appellant) for payment of USD 175,648 and related interest, based on agreements the appellant claimed were entered into under economic duress. The appellant counterclaimed for a declaration that the agreements were void and sought their cancellation, while also applying for an interlocutory injunction to prevent registration of a deed of assignment. After the High Court refused joinder of the Chief Registrar of Lands, it ordered the Registrar to register the deed—despite the pending counterclaim—while restraining disposal of the property until final determination. The Court of Appeal held that the High Court judge exceeded her jurisdiction by making a substantive order on the deed's registration without a hearing, thereby prejudging an issue central to the counterclaim. The appellate court found the order incompetent and void, emphasizing that the judge was only tasked with deciding whether to strike out the injunction motion, not to resolve underlying property rights. The appeal was allowed and the registration order set aside.",
