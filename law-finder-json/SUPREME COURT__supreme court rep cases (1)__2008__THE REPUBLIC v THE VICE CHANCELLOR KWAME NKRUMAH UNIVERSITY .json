  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC v THE VICE CHANCELLOR KWAME NKRUMAH UNIVERSITY",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case involved five Nigerian students (appellants) who were dismissed from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) following alleged involvement in occultism and violence. The dismissal, carried out by the Vice-Chancellor based on an Interim Report (Exhibit KNUST '3'), was challenged on grounds of violation of university regulations and Article 25 of the 1992 Constitution, which guarantees the right to fair hearing. The appellants argued that no Committee of Enquiry was properly constituted as required under Article 7 of the Students Guide, and they were not given a chance to present their case. The Supreme Court found that the respondent failed to provide any details about the composition, formation, or procedures of the alleged inquiry committee, placing the burden of proof on the university under Section 17(1) of the Evidence Act, 1975 (NRCD 323). The Court held that the dismissal violated principles of administrative fairness and natural justice, as the appellants were denied procedural rights. The appeal was allowed, and the dismissals were quashed.",
