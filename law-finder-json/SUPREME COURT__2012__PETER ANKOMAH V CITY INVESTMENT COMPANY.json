  "caseTitle": "PETER ANKOMAH V CITY INVESTMENT COMPANY",
  "summary": "In Peter Ankomah v City Investment Company Limited, the Supreme Court of Ghana addressed whether damages for loss of use of seized property constitute general or special damages in a detinue claim. The plaintiff's property— a car and refrigerator—was wrongfully seized during execution of a judgment against his wife. The High Court awarded damages for loss of use and replacement value, but the Court of Appeal recharacterized loss of use as special damages requiring strict proof, awarding only nominal damages. The Supreme Court upheld that detinue allows recovery of the chattel or its value plus damages for detention, but emphasized that loss of use is recoverable only where actual damage to the chattel is proven, aligning with English tort law precedents. Since no damage was shown, the plaintiff was not entitled to loss of use damages. The Court affirmed the replacement value awards, noting the trial judge's discretion in assessing reasonable figures despite exaggerated claims.",
