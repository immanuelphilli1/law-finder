  "caseTitle": "STATUTORY REGULATION OF EXCLUSION CLAUSES IN CONSUMER CONTRA",
  "summary": "This legal analysis examines the statutory regulation of exclusion clauses in consumer contracts under Ghanaian law, focusing on the Sale of Goods Act, 1962 (Act 137) and the Hire Purchase Decree, 1974 (NRCD 292). It highlights how these laws limit the ability of sellers and owners to exclude liability for defective goods or breach of implied terms, particularly in consumer transactions. The document emphasizes that exclusion clauses are only valid if properly brought to the buyer's attention and their effect clearly explained, especially to illiterate consumers, as demonstrated in Ashitey v Ghana Industrial Holding Corporation. It also discusses judicial interpretations of 'ordinary course of business' from English cases like Spencer Trading Co. Ltd v Devon and Ashington Piggeries Ltd v Christopher Hill Ltd, which have been influential in expanding seller liability. The analysis further notes that while section 76 of Act 137 allows parties to vary contractual terms, such variations cannot override mandatory statutory protections, as confirmed in Donkor v Motor Parts Trading Company and Donkor v Owona Farkye Brothers Transport. Additionally, NRCD 292 imposes strict formalities and implied terms in hire-purchase agreements, prohibiting oppressive clauses and ensuring hirer protection. Overall, Ghanaian courts have taken a vigilant approach to prevent the misuse of exclusion clauses, especially in contexts involving inequality of bargaining power.",
