  "caseTitle": "AND DUA VERSUS RIPLEY",
  "summary": "In Adjei and Dua v. Ripley, the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast held that a European man who fathered a child with an African woman through concubinal relations was liable for the child's maintenance under native law and custom. The court found paternity established based on circumstantial evidence, including the child's birth timing, racial descent, and the defendant's payment of \u000235 toward expenses. Relying on section 87(1) of the Courts Ordinance, c. 4 of 1951, the court applied native custom to a non-native party, reasoning that failure to do so would result in substantial injustice. It affirmed that under Gold Coast native custom, fathers are primarily responsible for their children's upkeep\u0002a principle of general application that need not be specifically pleaded under Civil Procedure Rules, Ord. 19, r. 31. The court awarded \u0002156 for past maintenance (adjusted for delayed claim) and ordered future payments of \u00024 per month. The decision emphasized equality of legal obligation regardless of race, aligning customary duties with principles of natural justice.",
