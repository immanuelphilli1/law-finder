  "summary": "In this 2008 Supreme Court of Ghana judgment, the plaintiffs—Rojo Mettle Nunoo, Squadron Leader (Rtd) Clend Sowu, and Kofi Portuphy—sought declarations and orders compelling the Electoral Commission to publish full, detailed results of the December 2004 Presidential Election, including polling station-level data, arguing that the Commission's publication of only the 'Declaration of President Elect Instrument, 2004' (CI 49) failed to meet its constitutional obligations under Article 63(9) and violated principles of transparency under Article 45. The Court, per Dr. Date-Bah JSC, held that Article 63(9) only requires the declaration to be executed under the hand and seal of the EC Chairman and to state that a candidate was declared elected—detailed results need not be included in the instrument. The Court further ruled that the plaintiffs' action was not an election petition under Article 64(1), as they challenged the validity of the declaration, not the election itself, and thus the 21-day time limit for election petitions did not apply. The Court affirmed the validity of CI 49 and declined to order the publication of granular results, noting that Article 49 ensures such data is accessible in the public domain. The judgment emphasized a literal and purposive interpretation of the Constitution, upholding the Electoral Commission's compliance with its constitutional duties.",

    "The referral to the Supreme Court was justified due to genuine constitutional questions requiring authoritative interpretation."
