  "caseTitle": "FKA COMPANY LTD v EFFAH SARKODIE",
  "summary": "In FKA Company Ltd v Effah Sarkodie, the Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed the appellant's appeal challenging the lower courts' judgment in favor of the respondent for declaration of title, recovery of possession, damages for trespass, and perpetual injunction over 95.194 acres at New Weija. The plaintiff established that its managing director acquired the land by customary grant from the Weija Stool in 1980, took possession, and later had the title formalized in the company's name upon incorporation in 1998. The defendant claimed a grant from the Ngleshie Amanfro Stool and later from the Weija Stool, but the court found this invalid as the Weija Stool had already alienated the land. A court-appointed surveyor confirmed that 85% of the defendant's claimed land overlapped with the plaintiff's. The Supreme Court upheld the principle that a valid customary conveyance divests the grantor of further interest (nemo dat quod non habet), and held that the plaintiff's evidence, including prior judgments and a cadastral plan, satisfied the burden of proof on a balance of probabilities. The appeal, based solely on the weight of evidence, was dismissed as the findings were amply supported.",
