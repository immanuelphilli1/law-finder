  "caseTitle": "SEPARATION OF POWERS IN GHANA THE NEW ROLE FOR PARLIAMENT [1",
  "summary": "This 1980 legal analysis by Nii Aryee J. examines the doctrine of separation of powers in Ghana, focusing on constitutional developments leading to the 1979 Constitution. It critiques the ineffectiveness of the Westminster parliamentary model in Ghana due to cultural and institutional mismatches, highlighting how executive dominance undermined legislative independence. The 1978 Constitutional Commission recommended a strict separation of powers, culminating in Article 75 of the 1979 Constitution, which established a fully independent Parliament separate from the executive. The paper evaluates Parliament's new role in a system of separated institutions sharing powers, analyzing its deliberative, legislative, and financial functions. It emphasizes the need for clear constitutional rules to enable effective cooperation between the executive and legislature, while cautioning against 'politics of immobilism.' The judiciary's historical independence is noted, but concerns remain about Parliament's capacity to balance executive power after years of subordination.",
