  "caseTitle": "IBRAHIM RAZAK, KENNEDY YEMOAH V THE REPUBLIC",
  "summary": "The appellants, Ibrahim Razak and Kennedy Yemoah, were convicted by the High Court for three counts of armed robbery committed on July 27, 2005, in West Anaji, Takoradi, involving the use of force and threats to steal property from three households. They were identified through police-conducted identification parades and oral testimony from prosecution witnesses who described physical features such as low haircuts and fair complexion. The Court of Appeal upheld the convictions but reduced the life sentences to 30 years, citing proportionality. The Supreme Court dismissed the further appeal, finding no merit in the grounds of doubtful identification or alibi, and affirmed that the prosecution had proven identity beyond reasonable doubt.",
