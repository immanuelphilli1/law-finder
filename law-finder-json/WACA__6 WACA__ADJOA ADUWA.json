  "caseTitle": "ADJOA ADUWA",
  "summary": "This civil case involved a dispute over the enforcement of a writ of fieri facias (fi. fa.) on a farm pledged as security for a debt. Adjoa Aduwa, the appellant, claimed her farm was unconditionally released by the respondent, G.O. Abosi, and that executing the writ constituted trespass. The respondent argued the release was conditional upon substitution with another farm, which never materialized. The Asantehene's Native Court 'B' found for the respondent, holding the release was conditional and the original security remained valid. Although Court 'A' reversed this on appeal, the Chief Commissioner's Court restored the original judgment. The West Africa Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, affirming that the security was not unconditionally released and the execution was lawful.",
