  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC v THE HIGH COURT, KOFORIDUA EX-PARTE NANA OTUT",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana granted an application for certiorari to quash a ruling by the High Court, Koforidua, which had assumed jurisdiction over a dispute involving the legitimacy of multiple Traditional Councils in Akuapim and the status of certain individuals as Paramount Chiefs. The Supreme Court held that the matter was inherently a chieftaincy issue, as it required determination of chieftaincy status, enstoolment processes, and authority to lead councils—matters exclusively within the jurisdiction of traditional tribunals under the Chieftaincy Act, 2008 (Act 759) and the Courts Act, 1993 (Act 459). Despite the High Court's view that the case involved statutory interpretation of Traditional Councils, the Supreme Court found a patent error of law on the record, as the real issues—restraint from claiming chieftaincy titles and leadership roles—were inseparable from chieftaincy disputes. The Court emphasized judicial economy and the risk of conflicting rulings, concluding that the entire matter should be referred to the appropriate chieftaincy forum.",
