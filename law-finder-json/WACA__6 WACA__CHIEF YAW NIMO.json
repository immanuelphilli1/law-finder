  "summary": "This 1940 West Africa Court of Appeal decision from Kumasi, Ghana, involved a land dispute between Chief Yaw Nimo (Plaintiff-Appellant) and Kwaku Wuo (Defendant-Respondent) over a parcel known as 'Kyim Kwayem.' The case had a complex procedural history, passing through the Asantehene's Court 'B,' Asantehene's Court 'A,' and the Chief Commissioner's Court before reaching the appellate court. The core issue was ownership of a specific tract edged yellow on Plan 'L.' The Asantehene's Court 'B' originally ruled for the Defendant based on an inspection report, plan evidence (Exhibits C and D), and the Plaintiff’s failure to respond to oaths by third parties (Aku and Kwarso) claiming parts of the land. The appellate court found the trial court's reasoning clear and reasonable, especially after a proper scaled plan (Exhibit L) was produced. It rejected reliance on prior executive decisions (e.g., the 1907 Hobart decision) that did not resolve the boundary between the parties. The appeal was allowed, the judgment of Asantehene's Court 'B' was restored, and costs were awarded to the Appellant.",
