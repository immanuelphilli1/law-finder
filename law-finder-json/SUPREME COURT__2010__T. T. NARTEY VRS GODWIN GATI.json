  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana issued a unanimous ruling in response to a reference from a Magistrate's Court on whether Section 30 of the Legal Profession Act, 1960 (Act 32) is inconsistent with Article 17(1) of the 1992 Constitution, which guarantees equality before the law. The Court held that Article 17(1) does not require absolute equality but permits reasonable differentiation if such classification bears a rational relationship to a legitimate legislative objective. The Court emphasized that only the Supreme Court has the authority to interpret the Constitution under its original jurisdiction, while lower courts apply clear constitutional provisions. Drawing from Indian constitutional jurisprudence, particularly on Article 14, the Court clarified that not all differential treatment constitutes unlawful discrimination. The ruling affirms that Parliament may enact laws that treat different classes differently, provided they do not violate the specific prohibited grounds in Article 17(2) and serve a constitutional purpose.",
