  "caseTitle": "AFRICAN TRADE CO. v. HASNEM ENT. LTD",
  "summary": "This Court of Appeal case arose from a breach of contract where Hasnem Enterprise Ltd. purchased six chairs from Swiss African Trade Co. (S.A.T.), received two, but was denied the remaining four despite repeated attempts to collect. After ten years, Hasnem sued for specific performance. The trial magistrate awarded damages instead, which the High Court affirmed. S.A.T. appealed, arguing the damages were improperly awarded since they were not claimed in the writ. The Court of Appeal upheld the award, invoking its power under Rule 31 of C.I. 19 to amend pleadings to reflect the real issue and prevent multiplicity of actions. It held that the facts clearly established a breach of contract under the Sale of Goods Act, 1962 (Act 137), entitling Hasnem to damages as a legal remedy, even in the absence of a specific claim, and affirmed the lower courts' judgments.",
