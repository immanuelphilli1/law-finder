  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana judgment in Civil Appeal No. J4/50/2010, delivered on 18th April 2012, concerns a dispute over the headship of the Royal Adwenadzi family of Edukrom and ownership of associated stool lands. The appellant, Ebusua Panyin Kwa Kakraba, claimed to be the rightful head based on customary succession and burial rites performed for his predecessor, seeking a declaration of authority over family lands. The respondent, Kwesi Bo, contested this, asserting his branch (Edu Abekwa) were original settlers and rightful custodians. The High Court found no valid appointment of a head after Kwesi Bo and barred alienation of land until a proper head was appointed. The Court of Appeal affirmed the dismissal of the appellant's claim, declared title in favor of the respondent's section and the Edukrom stool, and set aside the injunction. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal's decision, finding the appellant failed to prove his headship, the application of precedent (HANNA ASSI No. 2) was correct, and the trial judge improperly issued an injunction without a formal application or hearing. The appeal was dismissed.",
