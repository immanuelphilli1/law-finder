  "summary": "In this 2010 criminal appeal before the Ghana Court of Appeal (Suit No. H2/16/2010), the appellants, CPL. Appiah Yaw and two others, challenged the jury empanelment process, seeking prior access to jurors' names and particulars to conduct background checks for potential bias. The Court unanimously dismissed the appeal. Yaw Appau, J.A., affirmed that the right to challenge jurors peremptorily or for cause under sections 249–251 of Act 30/60 (Criminal Procedure Code) is statutory, not a common law or equitable right. The Court held that the statute does not require advance disclosure of juror information, and such a requirement cannot be judicially imported. The purpose of the statutory challenge is to exclude jurors with known biases, not to enable speculative investigations into unknown individuals. The Court rejected the appellants' request as an overextension of statutory rights, emphasizing that the law does not permit litigants to investigate the impartiality of judges or jurors before trial. The appeal was dismissed for lack of merit.",
