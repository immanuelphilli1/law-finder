  "caseTitle": "ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RIGHTS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH POLIT",
  "summary": "This document is a scholarly lecture delivered during a 1993 human rights week in Ghana, examining the relationship between economic and social rights and civil and political rights within international law and the Ghanaian constitutional context. It traces the philosophical origins of human rights to natural law theories of Aquinas, Grotius, Locke, and Rawls, and discusses the evolution of international human rights instruments, particularly the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966), and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966). The lecture critiques the early Ghanaian judiciary's failure in Re Akoto to enforce human rights under the 1960 Constitution, describing it as a missed opportunity for justice. It highlights that the 1992 Constitution rectified this by making fundamental rights justiciable under Chapter 5. The author emphasizes the interdependence of all human rights categories and calls for their equal recognition and implementation, especially in the African context.",
