  "summary": "This is an appeal from a High Court decision that declared the election of Samuel Nyimakan as Member of Parliament for Wulensi Constituency void on grounds of ineligibility. The Court of Appeal upheld the decision, affirming that Nyimakan did not meet the constitutional requirement of hailing from the constituency. The appellant challenged the procedure, arguing the petition should have been initiated by writ of summons, not a petition form. The court held that the petition form was valid under Order 74 of the High Court Rules, which permits the application of English practice where local rules are silent. Any procedural irregularity was deemed voidable and waived due to the appellant's full participation. On the merits, the court found substantial evidence supporting the trial judge's conclusion that Nyimakan hailed from Saboba, not Wulensi, despite minor errors in reasoning. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the respondent's success in challenging the election.",
