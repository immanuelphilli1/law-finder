  "summary": "This 1952 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Ghana addressed a contempt of court ruling against Kwesi Enimil, who remained in possession of disputed land after a Writ of Possession was executed. The lower court had found him in contempt for failing to vacate the Bortogina lands following a judgment affirmed on 3rd February 1950. However, the appellate court allowed the appeal, holding that the appellant reasonably believed, based on an undertaking by the respondents' counsel during final leave proceedings on 22nd June 1950, that no further steps would be taken to enforce possession until the outcome of the Privy Council appeal was known. The court emphasized that contempt proceedings are strictissimi juris and that a reasonable mistake, especially where status quo was maintained and no actual possession taken by the respondents, negated contempt. The fine and costs were ordered to be repaid, and the appeal costs awarded to the appellant.",
