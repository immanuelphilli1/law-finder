  "caseTitle": "MISCELLANY-AT-LAW LEGAL ASPECT OF BLOOD TEST EVIDENCE [1987-",
  "summary": "This 1987-88 legal commentary by Osew E. O. examines the tension in Ghanaian law between the legal presumption of paternity under customary law and the use of scientific blood test evidence in paternity disputes. The author analyzes Section 32 of the Evidence Decree, 1975 (NRCD 323), which presumes a child born during marriage is the husband's, against Section 97, which permits bodily examinations and sample collection when necessary for justice. Despite the presumption, the article argues for greater judicial use of blood tests, citing foreign precedents like S v S and the UK's Family Law Reform Act 1969. It highlights jurisdictional limitations in lower courts, consent issues, and the need for comprehensive legislation to balance the child's best interests with scientific accuracy and evolving social norms.",
