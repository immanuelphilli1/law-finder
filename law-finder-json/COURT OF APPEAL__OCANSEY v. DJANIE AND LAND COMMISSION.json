  "summary": "In Ocansey v. Djanie and Land Commission (CA No. 35/99, 20 July 2000), the Court of Appeal of Ghana dismissed an appeal challenging the Circuit Court's decision that the respondent's land title was void. The appellant had purchased land from the chief of Okponglo in 1992, but the area had already been compulsorily acquired by the government. The Land Commission later leased part of the land to a third party. The Land Registry mistakenly issued a title certificate to the appellant. The trial court found the conveyance unlawful, the title void due to mistake, and dismissed the appellant's claims. The Court of Appeal affirmed, holding that post-acquisition conveyances without state consent are void, that the title could be rectified under PNDCL 152 s.122(1) for mistake, and that the Land Commission benefited from the presumption of regularity in public acts. The appeal and application to vary judgment for damages were dismissed.",
