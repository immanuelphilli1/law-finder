  "caseTitle": "THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS v. THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL",
  "summary": "The National Democratic Congress (NDC) filed a suit seeking a declaration and injunction to secure lifetime presidential benefits, including military security, for former President Jerry John Rawlings. The Supreme Court issued procedural orders for an expedited hearing, but the Plaintiff failed to file a Memorandum of Issues or legal submissions within the stipulated time, and no request for extension or waiver was made. Citing Rule 79 of the Supreme Court Rules (C.I. 16), which bars further prosecution for non-compliance with court orders unless waived, the Court found no justifiable reasons to excuse the Plaintiff's inaction. Consequently, the action was dismissed for lack of prosecution.",
