  "caseTitle": "OFORI ATTA II VERSUS MINISTER OF",
  "summary": "In OFORI ATTA II v. MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT (1958), the High Court of Ghana's Eastern Judicial Division considered an application for an interim injunction by Nana Ofori Atta II, the Omanhene and President of the Akyem Abuakwa State Council. The case arose after the government issued the Paramount Chiefs (Recognition) (Partial Revocation) Instrument, 1957, and a June 6, 1958 press release stating he would cease exercising functions as a Paramount Chief. A subsequent letter from the Government Agent directed the Council to appoint someone other than the Okyenhene to authorize documents. The court held that despite the respondent's admission of the applicant’s legal rights, the government's actions constituted a real and imminent threat to those rights. The court granted the interim injunction to preserve the status quo pending final determination of the originating summons, emphasizing that even admitted rights require protection against threatened interference by state agents.",
