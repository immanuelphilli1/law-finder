  "caseTitle": "K. C. DINSEY, NOI OWUO II AND NOI LARTEY",
  "summary": "This is an appeal from a decision by the Acting Deputy Provincial Commissioner of the Eastern Province, who set aside a Native Tribunal's judgment awarding damages for trespass in a creek known as Lubu. The Native Tribunal had found in favor of the plaintiffs-appellants, K. C. Dinsey, Noi Owuo II, and Noi Lartey, holding that the defendants' village was built too close to the creek and would be fully covered during overflow. The Acting Deputy Provincial Commissioner nullified the ruling on the grounds that no land was specifically mentioned in connection with the creek in relevant documents. On appeal, the West Africa Court of Appeal held that the Commissioner took too narrow a view of the term 'creek,' which should include the area between the lowest ebb and highest flow under normal conditions. The Court emphasized that Native Tribunals, having local knowledge and direct witness testimony, are better positioned to make factual determinations. It reaffirmed the principle that appellate courts should not be overly strict regarding procedural technicalities in Native Tribunal cases, citing Archie Kwow v. Ohene Essien Eku II (2 W.A.C.A. 180). Although the original claim was for trespass, the case effectively became one of title between the plaintiffs and co-defendant Tei Wayoe, which was properly adjudicated. The Court upheld the Tribunal’s decision, restored the award of damages, and allowed the appeal with costs.",
