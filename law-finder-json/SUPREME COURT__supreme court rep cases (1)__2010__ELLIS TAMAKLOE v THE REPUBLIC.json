  "caseTitle": "ELLIS TAMAKLOE v THE REPUBLIC",
  "summary": "In this criminal appeal, Ellis Tamakloe challenged his conviction and 10-year sentence for attempted exportation and possession of 695g of cannabis without lawful authority. The Supreme Court of Ghana upheld the lower courts' decisions, affirming that circumstantial evidence sufficiently established Tamakloe's possession and control of the parcel containing the drugs. The Court found that Tamakloe's act of personally filling in consignee details on the airway bill and failing to question the incorrect sender's address (Friesland Company) supported an irresistible inference of guilt. The Court emphasized that knowledge and intent—key elements of mens rea—can be inferred from conduct, and held that the prosecution met the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt using circumstantial evidence in line with established legal principles.",
