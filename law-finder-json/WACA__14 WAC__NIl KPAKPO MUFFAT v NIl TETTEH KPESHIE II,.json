  "summary": "This 1952 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Kpakpo Muffat v. Tetteh Kpeshie II addressed whether the Land Court had discretion under the proviso to section 52(1) of the Native Courts (Colony) Ordinance, 1944, to hear an appeal filed out of time. The appellants, representing the Dsase of Sempe, challenged the Land Court's grant of conditional leave to appeal where the notice was filed beyond the one-month deadline stipulated in Regulation 115(1) of the Native Courts (Colony) Procedure Regulations, 1945. The Court held that the proviso only allows discretion to hear and determine an appeal that has been properly brought before the court, and since timely filing is a jurisdictional prerequisite, no valid appeal existed upon which discretion could be exercised. The appeal was allowed, the Land Court’s order set aside, and costs awarded.",
