  "caseTitle": "KOFORIDUA EX-PARTE AUGUSTUS OSAE-AKONNOR , SAMUEL",
  "summary": "The applicant, Augustus Osae-Akonnor, challenged orders made by the High Court in Koforidua in an ex-parte application by Samuel Agyei, the interested party. The High Court had issued an absconding warrant and ordered the applicant to surrender three vehicles or post $192,000 as security, based on allegations that the applicant intended to leave the jurisdiction. The applicant was arrested, and bail was granted only after compliance with stringent conditions, including depositing a land title certificate as security and regular reporting to court. The Supreme Court reviewed whether these orders breached the rules of natural justice, particularly audi alteram partem, and were made without proper jurisdiction or in error of law. The court held that the preservation order under Order 25 Rule 2(1) of C.I. 47 required notice to the affected party, and its issuance ex-parte violated procedural fairness. The order for preservation was quashed, but the absconding warrant, properly issued under Order 73 Rule 1, was upheld.",

  "confidenceNotes": "The ruling is based on clear procedural violations under C.I. 47 and constitutional principles. Citations to prior Supreme Court decisions strengthen the legal rationale. The distinction between ex-parte permissible orders (absconding warrant) and those requiring notice (property preservation) is well-established in Ghanaian jurisprudence.",
