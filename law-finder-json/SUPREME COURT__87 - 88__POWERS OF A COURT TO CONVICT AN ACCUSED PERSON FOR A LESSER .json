  "caseTitle": "POWERS OF A COURT TO CONVICT AN ACCUSED PERSON FOR A LESSER",
  "summary": "This legal analysis examines the scope and application of section 154 of Ghana's Criminal Procedure Code, 1960 (Act 30), which permits a court to convict an accused of a lesser or included offence even when not formally charged, provided the facts support it. The provision aims to prevent multiplicity of trials and ensure justice where the prosecution fails to prove the full charge but establishes a lesser offence. However, the article argues that section 154 must be narrowly interpreted to uphold principles of fair trial, legal certainty, and protection against surprise. Drawing on precedents from the West African Court of Appeal and Ghana’s Court of Appeal—particularly Sarimbe v The Republic—it emphasizes that a lesser offence must be inherently included within the charged offence, not merely factually connected. The discussion highlights that appellate courts may substitute convictions under this section, but only when the legal and factual elements align without prejudicing the accused's right to a fair defence.",
