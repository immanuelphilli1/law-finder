  "caseTitle": "JALLOW VERSUS JALLOW.",
  "summary": "In Jallow v. Jallow, a divorced husband claimed half the value of buildings erected on land owned solely by his wife prior to marriage, funded from joint marital earnings. The Supreme Court of the Colony of the Gambia held that the legal maxim 'quicquid plantatur solo, solo cedit' (whatever is planted on the soil becomes part of the soil) applied, and the exception in equity—where a builder mistakenly believes they own the land and the true owner fails to correct them—did not arise because the husband knew the land belonged to his wife. The court emphasized that awareness of defective title bars equitable relief, and the spousal relationship does not alter this principle. The plaintiff's claim failed, and the defendant's counterclaim for cattle was also dismissed due to insufficient evidence. Judgment was entered for the defendant on the claim and the counterclaim was dismissed, both with costs.",
