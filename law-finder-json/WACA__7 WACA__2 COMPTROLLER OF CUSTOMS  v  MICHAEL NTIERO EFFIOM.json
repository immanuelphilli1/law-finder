  "caseTitle": "2 COMPTROLLER OF CUSTOMS v MICHAEL NTIERO EFFIOM",
  "summary": "This 1941 West Africa Court of Appeal decision involved Michael Ntiero Effiom, who was convicted by the High Court at Buea on three charges: smuggling twelve tierces of tobacco, possession of a prohibited import (an automatic pistol), and possession of twenty rounds of pistol ammunition. The Appellant's convictions were appealed to the West Africa Court of Appeal, where the Crown's counsel conceded inability to support any of the convictions. The appellate court found no evidence of actual or attempted smuggling for the first charge, and ruled that the second and third charges—related to prohibited imports—should have been struck out due to legal deficiencies previously highlighted in a stated case. Consequently, the court allowed the appeal, quashed all convictions, annulled sentences and forfeiture orders, and directed that judgments of acquittal be entered on all charges.",
