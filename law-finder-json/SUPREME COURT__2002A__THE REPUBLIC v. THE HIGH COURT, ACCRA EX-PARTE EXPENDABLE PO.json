  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC v. THE HIGH COURT, ACCRA EX-PARTE EXPENDABLE PO",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an application for certiorari seeking to quash a High Court judgment delivered beyond the six-week period mandated by L.I. 1107, Order 63(2A). The applicant argued the delayed judgment was null and void, citing Republic v. Judicial Committee of the Central Region House of Chiefs, Ex-parte Supi Mark Aaba. The Court held that L.I. 1107 aims to ensure timely judgment delivery but does not strip a court of jurisdiction or render late judgments void. Constitutional provisions, particularly Article 157(3), affirm that a judge remains functus officio only after judgment delivery, preserving jurisdiction despite delay. The Court found the earlier Supi Aaba decision per incuriam for failing to consider constitutional context and declined to follow it, emphasizing that procedural rules must align with constitutional principles.",
