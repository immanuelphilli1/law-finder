  "caseTitle": "P. S. INTERNATIONAL LIMITED & ORS. v. GODKA GROUP OF COMPANI",
  "summary": "In P.S. International Limited v. Godka Group of Companies, the Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed the appellant's appeal challenging the validity of judgments from the High Court and Court of Appeal. The appellant argued that the judgments were null and void due to delays beyond statutory timelines under Order 63 Rule 2A of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules and Rule 33 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The Court held that such time limits are directory, not mandatory, especially in light of Article 157(3) of the 1992 Constitution, which keeps a judge functus officio until judgment is delivered. The Court also found error in the Court of Appeal’s treatment of invoices attached to the statement of claim as evidence, as they were not properly tendered. However, this error was deemed harmless given that the same documents were later admitted via the defendant’s own exhibit. The core issue—whether the first consignment was sold outright or on a sell-or-return basis—was resolved in favor of a completed sale based on sufficient credible evidence. The appeal was accordingly dismissed.",
