  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC VRS THE COURT OF APPEAL ANTHONY THOMFORD",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana considered an application for certiorari to quash an order of the Court of Appeal that struck out an appeal based solely on the Registrar's Certificate of non-compliance with Rule 20(1) of CI 19, without hearing the appellant's counsel. The applicant, Ghana Chartered Institute of Bankers, argued that the audi alteram partem principle was breached. The Supreme Court emphasized that failure to afford a party an opportunity to be heard violates natural justice and results in a jurisdictional nullity. It held that the Court of Appeal erred by acting on the Registrar's Certificate without allowing the appellant to challenge its validity. The Court further ruled that time limits under Rule 62 of CI 16 do not apply to jurisdictionally defective decisions. The ruling reaffirmed that procedural fairness is fundamental, and discretion under Rule 20(2) must be exercised only after hearing the affected party.",
