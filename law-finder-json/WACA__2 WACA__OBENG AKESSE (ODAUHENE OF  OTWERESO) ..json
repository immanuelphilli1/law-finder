  "caseTitle": "OBENG AKESSE (ODAUHENE OF OTWERESO) .",
  "summary": "This 1935 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Accra involved consolidated cross-actions between the Stool of Otwereso, represented by Odauhene Obeng Akesse, and the Stool of Adjobue, represented by Odikro Takie Ababio, over disputed land between their villages. The land dispute had significant implications due to differing paramount chiefs' jurisdictions. The trial court granted the plaintiff a declaration of title and injunction, which the defendant appealed, arguing the judgment was against the weight of evidence. The appellate court upheld the trial judge's findings, accepting the credibility of the plaintiff's evidence, including the swearing of an oath that initiated the dispute and explained non-interference with cocoa farms established by the defendant's people in the last twenty years. The court emphasized deference to the trial judge's assessment of witness credibility while asserting its role in drawing independent inferences from proven facts, ultimately dismissing the appeal.",
