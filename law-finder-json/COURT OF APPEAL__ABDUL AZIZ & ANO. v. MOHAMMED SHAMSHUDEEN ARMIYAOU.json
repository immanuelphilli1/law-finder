  "caseTitle": "AZIZ & ANO. v. MOHAMMED SHAMSHUDEEN ARMIYAOU",
  "summary": "The Court of Appeal of Ghana allowed in part an appeal against a summary judgment granted by the High Court in favour of the plaintiff for $5,400 and interest, obtained under Order 14 of the High Court Civil Procedure Rules. The plaintiff had paid the defendant to secure a U.S. visa, which turned out to be fake, and sought a full refund. The defendant admitted receiving the money, claimed to have refunded $800, and asserted a right to deduct legitimate expenses for other services rendered under a $6,000 agreement. The Court of Appeal held that the defendant had raised triable issues through admission of partial liability and a set-off defence, which were not traversed, thus warranting leave to defend on the balance. The High Court erred in granting full judgment without allowing defence on the disputed portion. Although the appellant claimed he was not heard, the appellate court found he had actual notice of proceedings and chose to absent himself, making the complaint untenable. The judgment was set aside and the defendant granted leave to defend.",
