  "summary": "In Welbeck v. M. Captan Ltd. and Hammond, the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast addressed a dispute over the rightful head of the Kreshie family and entitlement to collect rents from family properties. The plaintiff, Welbeck, claimed appointment as caretaker and administrator following the removal of Hammond, who had previously served as head. A 1942 family resolution and a 1945 Native Court judgment confirmed Welbeck and Thompson as administrators. In 1946, Hammond was reappointed at a family meeting, leading to conflicting Native Court rulings. On appeal, Coussey J. held the issue res judicata in favor of Welbeck due to the earlier judgment. Subsequently, in 1951, another meeting appointed Hammond head despite the non-attendance of Welbeck and his son, who had been invited. The court held that the meeting was validly constituted as it included representatives from both family branches, and the burden was on Welbeck to prove the meeting was non-representative or that absentees were indispensable—evidence he failed to provide. The court dismissed the plaintiff's action, affirming Hammond's appointment and right to administer family property.",
