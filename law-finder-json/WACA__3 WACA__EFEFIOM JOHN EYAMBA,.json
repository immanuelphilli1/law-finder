  "caseTitle": "EFEFIOM JOHN EYAMBA,",
  "summary": "The plaintiffs-appellants, members of the Eyamba family and a Syrian lessee, appealed a High Court decision dismissing their claim for possession of land in Calabar and removal of buildings erected by the defendant-respondent. The land was leased under the Native Lands Acquisition Ordinance to the third plaintiff, who defaulted on a judgment debt, leading to a judicial sale under a writ of Fi. Fa. The defendant purchased the property at auction and received a certificate of purchase. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that the third plaintiff lost his right to the unexpired lease term through the judicial sale, and the other plaintiffs lacked locus standi as they were not proper parties to sue without the Etubom, trustee of Eyamba land. The court rejected the argument that sections 3 and 4 of the Ordinance invalidated the sale, noting the transaction involved an alien-to-alien transfer, not acquisition from a native. The plaintiffs failed to prove superior title or right of entry at the time of the writ. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
