  "caseTitle": "SAMUEL Q. NELSON",
  "summary": "This was a civil appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal concerning a land dispute in Accra, Ghana. The Plaintiff-Appellant, Samuel Q. Nelson, claimed damages for trespass by the Defendants-Respondents, S. Ammah and Yawa Aruna, on land he purchased in 1920 from Isaac Cobblah Fiscian, Head of the Aruna Family. The Ga Tribunal and Provincial Commissioner dismissed the claim, relying on Exhibits B, C, and F to support the Defendants' superior title. The Appeal Court found that the Tribunals had committed serious misdirections: Exhibit B (1934) did not appoint Yawa Aruna as Head of Family and could not affect prior transactions; Exhibit C (1931 judgment) did not adjudicate family headship and thus was not res judicata; and Exhibit F (a Cape Coast succession case) was wrongly applied to Ga customary law. The Court emphasized that the real issue was title, not mere possession, and ordered a re-hearing de novo by the Ga Mantse's Tribunal with clear directions on the proper interpretation of evidence and Ga law. The appeal was allowed, prior judgments set aside, and costs awarded to the Appellant.",
