  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC VRS THE HIGH COURT, COMMERCIAL DIVISION, ACCRA",
  "summary": "This 2009 Supreme Court of Ghana ruling addressed the legality of committal proceedings initiated against Millicom Ghana Limited and its directors for alleged contempt of court. The High Court, Commercial Division, had issued a bench warrant following failure to comply with an injunction order. The Supreme Court held that committal proceedings against corporate directors require personal service on those individuals, which had not occurred. It further ruled that an application for stay of execution based on a non-executable ruling was invalid. The Court granted certiorari, quashing the lower court's order, and directed that the company be struck out from the committal application unless proper service was made on the individual directors, emphasizing adherence to natural justice and procedural rules.",
