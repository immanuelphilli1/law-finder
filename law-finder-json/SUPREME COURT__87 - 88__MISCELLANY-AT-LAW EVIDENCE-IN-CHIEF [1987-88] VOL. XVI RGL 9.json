  "summary": "This legal commentary from the 1987–88 Review of Ghana Law discusses best practices and challenges in conducting examination-in-chief in Ghanaian trials. It emphasizes that counsel should guide witnesses to present their testimony clearly and chronologically, avoiding leading questions except in permitted circumstances. The paper critiques counsel who dominate proceedings, stressing that the focus should remain on the witness and the client's case. It also addresses judicial conduct, cautioning against premature dismissal of testimony and highlighting the tension between truth-seeking and procedural efficiency. Referencing both local and foreign jurisprudence, including the Evidence Decree, 1975 (NRCD 323), the author underscores that relevance is a matter of judgment, not mere logic, and calls for judicial restraint and assistance to ensure fair presentation of evidence.",
