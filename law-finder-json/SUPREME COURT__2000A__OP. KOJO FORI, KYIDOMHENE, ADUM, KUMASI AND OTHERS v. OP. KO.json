  "caseTitle": "OP. KOJO FORI, KYIDOMHENE, ADUM, KUMASI AND OTHERS v. OP. KO",
  "summary": "This is a chieftaincy review application before the Supreme Court of Ghana, where the applicants sought to have the Court's earlier judgment in Chieftaincy Appeal No. 10/98 reviewed. The original decision had dismissed the applicants' appeal against the National House of Chiefs' confirmation of the nomination and installation of the 2nd respondent as Adumhene. The applicants argued that the judgment caused a grave miscarriage of justice due to alleged misapplication of Ashanti customary law, particularly regarding the role of the Ayete stool in a patrilineal succession system. The Supreme Court, relying on Article 133(1) of the Constitution and Rule 54 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1996 (C.I. 16), reiterated that its review jurisdiction is not appellate and cannot be used to re-litigate issues already decided. The Court found no fundamental error in the original judgment, noting that the 2nd applicant’s claim was traced through a female line, which was inconsistent with the patrilineal nature of the Adum Stool. The application was dismissed unanimously for failure to establish exceptional circumstances or new evidence warranting review.",
