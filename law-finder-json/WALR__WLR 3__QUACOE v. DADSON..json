  "caseTitle": "QUACOE VERSUS DADSON.",
  "summary": "In Quaco v. Dadson, the plaintiff sued for defamation after the defendant publicly called him an 'ex-convict' in Anomabu, alleging multiple prior convictions and imprisonments. The High Court, applying English law due to the parties' literacy and the nature of the alleged wrong, held that the statement was slanderous per se as it imputed a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment. The judge accepted the plaintiff's testimony and corroboration by the defendant's own companion, rejecting the defendant's alibi for lack of supporting evidence. Relying on English precedents, the court ruled that such imputations cause lasting social disgrace (obloquy) and are actionable without proof of special damage. The defendant failed to justify the statement, which was wholly false. The plaintiff was awarded �50 in damages with costs.",
