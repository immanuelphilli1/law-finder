  "caseTitle": "AUGUSTUS KPAKPO BROWN v. S. BOSOMTWI & CO. LTD. & ADAM KWATE",
  "summary": "This 2002 Supreme Court of Ghana decision in CA No. 1/2001 involves a land dispute between Augustus Kpakpo Brown (plaintiff/appellant) and S. Bosomtwi & Co. Ltd. and Adam Kwatei Quartey (defendants). The plaintiff claimed ownership of land at Anyah, Greater Accra, seeking damages for gravel excavation and a perpetual injunction. The defendants countered that the land belonged to the Gbawe Kwatei Family, who had granted them rights. The trial court and Court of Appeal found in favor of the defendants, ruling the plaintiff failed to clearly identify and prove ownership of the land, particularly its western boundary. The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' concurrent findings, finding no miscarriage of justice, and dismissed the appeal.",
