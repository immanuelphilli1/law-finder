  "caseTitle": "LOROMEKE VERSUS NEKEGHO",
  "summary": "In this 1957 Ghanaian case, the plaintiff, a Nigerian from Urhobo descent residing in Accra, sought enforcement of a customary order requiring the widow of his deceased brother to repay her dowry and surrender custody of her two children. The lower courts had ruled in his favor based on alleged Urhobo customary law, which permits a family to select a member to marry a widow and, if refused, reclaim the dowry and children. The High Court, Eastern Judicial Division, allowed the appeal. It held that while the custom was sufficiently proven as a fact (especially since the defendants admitted it), the document authorizing the plaintiff to act on behalf of the family was not properly authenticated and thus inadmissible. Crucially, the court ruled that enforcing a custom that strips a mother of custody of her children solely because she refuses a levirate marriage is repugnant to natural justice, equity, and good conscience under section 87 of the Courts Ordinance. The judgments of the lower courts were set aside.",
