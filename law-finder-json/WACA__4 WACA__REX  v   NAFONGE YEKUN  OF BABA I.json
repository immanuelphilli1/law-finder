  "summary": "The appellant, Nafonge Yekun of Baba I, was convicted in the High Court of receiving stolen property, a decision later appealed to the West African Court of Appeal. The appeal challenged the jurisdiction and procedural validity of the trial, arguing that the case was improperly transferred from the Ndop Native Court without a valid order under section 25(1)(c) of the Native Courts Ordinance. The District Officer's directive to \"re-try by me\" did not constitute a lawful transfer to the Magistrate's Court. Additionally, the appellant was not informed of his right under section 33 of the Protectorate Courts Ordinance (as amended) to elect trial in the High Court, rendering the Magistrate's trial void ab initio. The High Court further erred by adopting the incomplete Magistrate's proceedings instead of conducting a de novo trial. The Court of Appeal held that all proceedings were void due to lack of jurisdiction and procedural defects, allowed the appeal, and directed a verdict of acquittal under section 10(2) of the West African Court of Appeal Ordinance.",
