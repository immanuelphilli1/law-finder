  "caseTitle": "THOMAS HUTTON-MILLS",
  "summary": "This appeal from a judgment in the Divisional Court at Kumasi concerned a dispute over commission claimed by Thomas Hutton-Mills under a Power of Attorney and Commission Note dated 5th September 1938. The plaintiff-respondent sought 50% of arrears of rent recovered from Offin River Gold Estates Limited, amounting to £1,644 10s. The defendants-appellants, representing various Ashanti stools, argued that the Power of Attorney only authorized the respondent to re-enter and dispose of gold concessions, not to collect outstanding rent arrears. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that the written instruments governed by English law must be strictly construed, and the authority granted did not include recovering past rents. Furthermore, any agreement to pay based on a mistake of law was unenforceable. The court allowed the appeal, setting aside the lower court's judgment.",
