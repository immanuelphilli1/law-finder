  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC VRS HIGH",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an ex parte application by MY Shipping Pvt Limited seeking to quash a High Court, Tema ruling that refused a stay of proceedings and referral to arbitration. The applicant, involved in a consolidated admiralty dispute over a cargo lien on the vessel M/T 'MY ARCTIC', had filed its motion for stay only after participating in procedural steps including filing a defence, counterclaim, and additional issues, and after an application for directions had been heard. The Court held that under section 40(1) of the Arbitration Act, 1961 (Act 38), the application for stay must be made before the date fixed for hearing and in a timely manner. Given the delay and active participation in the proceedings, the Court found the application out of time. It further ruled that any alleged misinterpretation of the arbitration clause by the trial judge did not nullify jurisdiction and should be addressed on appeal, not through the Supreme Court's supervisory jurisdiction under Article 132 of the 1992 Constitution. The Court affirmed that while arbitration agreements are respected, parties must act promptly to invoke them.",
