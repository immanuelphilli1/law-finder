  "caseTitle": "MISCELLANY-AT-LAW PROOF IN CIVIL CASES SOME THOUGHTS ON LAND",
  "summary": "This legal paper by Justice Amua-Sekyi of the Supreme Court of Ghana examines the standard of proof in civil land suits, particularly actions for declaration of title. While civil cases generally require proof on a balance of probabilities, the courts demand a higher standard in land title cases—effectively proof beyond reasonable doubt—where plaintiffs must rely on the strength of their own case, not the weakness of the defendant's. This principle originates from West African Court of Appeal cases like *J M Kodilinye v Mbanefo Odu* and *Amodu Rufai v Ricketts*, where Webber CJ emphasized that title claims require robust, self-standing evidence. However, three key qualifications exist: (1) where boundaries are unclear, courts may remit for proper demarcation; (2) long, exclusive, and undisturbed possession shifts the burden of proof to the defendant; and (3) even without full title, plaintiffs may secure possession rights if entitled to occupation. The paper clarifies misconceptions about evidentiary standards and underscores the role of possession in land litigation.",
