  "summary": "This Court of Appeal case involved a land dispute between cousins Samuel Odoi Quarshie (plaintiff/respondent) and Yemoley Baakan (defendant/appellant) over a parcel of land at La near Degaulle Park, Accra. The plaintiff claimed the land was family property shared among three relatives, including his father, and sought declarations of title, ownership, and an injunction against interference, plus replacement of 600 blocks. The defendant denied the land was family property, asserting she purchased it independently and had paid for the blocks. The trial court ruled for the plaintiff, but the Court of Appeal set aside the judgment. The appellate court held that the plaintiff failed to meet the burden of proof by not providing corroborative evidence, clearly identifying the land boundaries, or properly amending the land size in pleadings. Additionally, the plaintiff lacked legal capacity to sue on behalf of the family or estate without establishing his representative status through probate, letters of administration, or vesting assent. As a result, the appeal was allowed, and judgment was entered in favor of the defendant on her counterclaim.",
