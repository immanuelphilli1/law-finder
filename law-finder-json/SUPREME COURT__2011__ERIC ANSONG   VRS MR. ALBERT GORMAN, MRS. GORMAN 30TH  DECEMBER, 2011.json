  "caseTitle": "ERIC ANSONG VRS MR. ALBERT GORMAN, MRS. GORMAN 30TH DECEMBER, 2011",
  "summary": "This is a civil appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana concerning the enforceability of a contract for the sale of property. The appellants, Mr. and Mrs. Gorman, challenged the Court of Appeal's affirmation of the High Court's decision ordering specific performance of a sale agreement allegedly entered into solely by Mr. Gorman, despite the property being jointly owned. The Supreme Court considered whether the contract was inchoate and unenforceable due to lack of consent from both co-owners, and whether the agreement was validly rescinded by the appellants prior to enforcement. The core issue centered on principles of contract law, co-ownership, and specific performance under Ghanaian property law.",
