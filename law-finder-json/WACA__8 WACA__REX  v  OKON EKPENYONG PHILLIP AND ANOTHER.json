  "caseTitle": "REX v OKON EKPENYONG PHILLIP AND ANOTHER",
  "summary": "This 1942 West Africa Court of Appeal decision involved an appeal against conviction by the High Court of two appellants, Okon Ekpenyong Phillip and Henry Iguma Oshodi. The court dismissed all grounds of appeal except concerning Count 14, which charged conspiracy to commit a felony under section 516 of the Criminal Code. The court held that Count 14 was bad for uncertainty because it failed to specify the nature of the alleged felony, depriving the accused of adequate notice. As a result, the convictions and sentences on Count 14 were quashed, and acquittals were entered on that count. Convictions on all other counts were upheld.",
