  "summary": "The 'Ajax case' involved the arrest of the Greek fishing vessel FV Ajax I by the Ghana Navy in March 1989 for illegal fishing within Ghana's territorial waters, approximately ten nautical miles south of Ada. The vessel was escorted to Tema Harbour, where its catch and documents were seized. The crew and associated parties were prosecuted before a Public Tribunal under the Public Tribunals Law (PNDCL 78) for acts intended to sabotage Ghana's economy. The tribunal imposed a penalty of $650,000 and ₵4,000,000 as compensation, costs, and reparation under PNDCL 213, ordered the release of the vessel and crew (with deportation recommended), and banned the Ajax vessels from Ghanaian waters. The analysis evaluates the case under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which Ghana had ratified. It concludes that Ghana had jurisdiction under UNCLOS Articles 19, 21, and 73 to arrest and prosecute for illegal fishing in its territorial sea. However, while the arrest was lawful, the tribunal’s procedures and penalties must comply with international limits—particularly Article 73, which prohibits imprisonment and mandates prompt release upon reasonable bond. The financial penalties imposed fall within Ghana’s discretionary authority, but the lack of explicit bond provisions and procedural transparency raises concerns about full conformity with UNCLOS standards.",
