  "summary": "The Court of Appeal of Ghana allowed an appeal by Police Sergeant Joseph Wenyonu, who had been convicted of neglect of duty under the Police Force Ordinance, s. 20. The charge stated only that the appellant was 'guilty of neglect of duty' on the same date and place as a separate, dismissed charge of aiding and abetting theft. The court held that the particulars of the offence failed to provide reasonable information about which duty was neglected, in violation of s. 111(1) and (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code. Relying on R. v. Bandoh, the court ruled that the discretion to uphold a conviction despite procedural defects cannot be exercised when the accused lacks adequate notice of the charge. The conviction was quashed, a verdict of not guilty entered, and any fine paid ordered to be repaid.",
