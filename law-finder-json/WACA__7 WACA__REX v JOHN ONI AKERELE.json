  "caseTitle": "REX v JOHN ONI AKERELE",
  "summary": "Dr. John Oni Akerele, a licensed medical practitioner, was convicted of manslaughter and a related charge of reckless or negligent conduct under sections 325 and 345(1)(f) of the Criminal Code for administering an overdose of the drug Sobita (sodium-bismuth-tartrate) to a patient, Kalu Ibe, who died from resulting toxaemia and oral sepsis. The West African Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal, affirming that the evidence— including the deaths of nine other children similarly treated—was properly admitted to prove the dose was an overdose and not due to individual idiosyncrasy. The court rejected a technical challenge to the coroner's committal, finding no substantial miscarriage of justice. It also held that Nigerian law on criminal negligence does not differ materially from English law, requiring a high degree of negligence amounting to a crime against the state. The trial judge's findings of fact—that the death resulted from an overdose and that the doctor's conduct was criminally negligent—were upheld as supported by ample evidence.",
