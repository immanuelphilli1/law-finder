  "summary": "In Atta Baffour v. Tema Development Corp. & Another, the plaintiff, Atta Baffour, had been invited by the deceased tenant E.Q. Quartey to reside in a property owned by the first defendant, Tema Development Corporation (TDC). Although Baffour made payments to Quartey, these were invalid under the Rent Act, Act 220, due to lack of landlord consent. After Quartey's death, Baffour formally applied to TDC to become the new tenant. The second defendant, who had lived rent-free in the kitchen providing care to Quartey, did not make a formal application but was nonetheless granted the tenancy by TDC. The High Court ruled in favor of Baffour, and on appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld the decision, holding that since Baffour was the only party to formally apply, he should have been granted the tenancy. The court emphasized that the landlord failed to provide justifiable reasons for awarding the tenancy to someone who did not apply, and thus the appeal was dismissed.",
