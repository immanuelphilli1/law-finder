  "summary": "This 2010 Supreme Court of Ghana judgment in Hon. P. C. Appiah-Ofori v. The Attorney General addressed the constitutional interpretation of the retiring age of the Auditor-General. The plaintiff, a Member of Parliament, sought declarations that the Auditor-General's retirement age should be 70 years, aligning with Justices of the Court of Appeal, and that Section 10(4) of the Audit Service Act, 2000 (Act 584), which set the retirement age at 60, was unconstitutional. The defendant, the Attorney General, conceded the plaintiff's position. The court, while acknowledging the concession, conducted an independent constitutional analysis. It held that the Auditor-General, appointed under Article 70 and subject to removal procedures under Article 146 like superior court judges, should have a retirement age of 70, consistent with analogous constitutional office holders. Consequently, Section 10(4) of Act 584 was declared inconsistent with the Constitution and null and void.",
