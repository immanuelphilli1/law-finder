  "caseTitle": "REX v MENSAH AKOTO",
  "summary": "The appellant, Mensah Akoto, was convicted of murdering Kpata Yivanyo, his mistress, by strangulation. The prosecution's case relied heavily on unsworn testimony from the victim's two young daughters (aged approximately 34 and 5 years), admitted under section 17(3) of Cap. 206, which permits unsworn evidence from children who understand the duty to tell the truth. The appeal challenged the sufficiency of corroboration required by law for such unsworn testimony. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that while the children's evidence could not corroborate each other, there was ample independent corroboration, particularly in the testimony of Kwasi Dator, the victim's uncle, who recounted the appellant's admission of the death, the suspicious injuries, and his failure to report the death. The trial judge had properly directed the jury to treat the uncles' evidence with caution due to potential ill-will. Medical and circumstantial evidence further supported the conviction. The court found the corroboration sufficient and dismissed the appeal.",
