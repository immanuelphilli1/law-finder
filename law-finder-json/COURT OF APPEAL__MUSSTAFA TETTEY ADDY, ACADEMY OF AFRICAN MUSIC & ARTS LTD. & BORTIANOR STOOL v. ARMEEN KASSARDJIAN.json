  "caseTitle": "ACADEMY OF AFRICAN MUSIC & ARTS LTD. & BORTIANOR STOOL VERSUS IN THE SUPERIOR COURT",
  "summary": "This appeal arose from a land dispute in which the respondent claimed ownership of land in the Greater Accra Region based on a 1973 purchase from the Abredze family of Gomoa Nyanyanor and registration as No. 1498/1977. The appellants, including Musstafa Tettey Addy and the Bortianor Stool, claimed ownership through traditional title from Kokrobite and Bortianor stools. The Court of Appeal overturned the High Court’s judgment in favor of the respondent, holding that the respondent’s case rested on inquiry 2/79, which was based on earlier inquiries (14/75 and 10/76) that had been set aside by the Stool Lands Boundary Appeals Tribunal. Thus, the foundation of the respondent’s claim had collapsed. Additionally, the respondent failed to call his grantors to prove how they acquired allodial title, placing the burden of proof on him which he did not meet. The court emphasized that registration alone does not confer title and that traditional ownership requires evidentiary support. The appellants’ traditional evidence, including the use of Lanma Hill as a boundary marker, was unchallenged. Consequently, the respondent’s claims for declaration of title, trespass damages, recovery of possession, and injunction failed. The appeal was allowed, and the judgment in favor of the respondent was set aside.",
