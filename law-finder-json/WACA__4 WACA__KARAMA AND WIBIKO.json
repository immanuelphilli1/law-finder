  "summary": "This is a consolidated civil land dispute before the West Africa Court of Appeal involving the people of Egdbema Adua (plaintiffs-appellants) and the people of Emilagan and chiefs of Emilwan (plaintiffs-respondents) over title to land known as Adei Egula. The trial judge had refused a declaration of title due to lack of a plan defining boundaries but granted an injunction restricting interference with certain parcels. The appellate court upheld the refusal of the declaration, agreeing that without a plan or clear evidence of partition from former common land, title could not be determined. It further ruled that the injunction was unenforceable due to uncertainty of the area it covered, citing legal principles requiring clarity in injunctive orders. The appeal was allowed in part: the injunction was set aside and a non-suit entered on that claim. Costs in the lower court were to be borne by both sides, while the appellant was awarded costs in the appellate court.",
