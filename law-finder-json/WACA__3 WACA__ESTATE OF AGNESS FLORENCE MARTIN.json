  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF AGNESS FLORENCE MARTIN, DECEASED BETWEEN VICTORIA FANNY MARTIN Plaintiff-Respondent",
  "summary": "In this probate appeal before the West African Court of Appeal, the second defendant-appellant, Emanuel Daniel Henshaw, challenged the grant of Letters of Administration to the plaintiff-respondent, Victoria Fanny Martin, as next of kin of the deceased, Agness Florence Martin, who died intestate in the Cameroons under British Mandate. The appellant claimed entitlement based on being head of the deceased's father's house, alleged adoption under native law and custom, and appointment by the deceased to bury her and succeed to her estate. The trial judge rejected these claims due to lack of positive evidence satisfying customary requirements, particularly the ceremonial aspects of adoption and burial appointment. The appellate court upheld the decision, affirming that claims rooted in native law and custom require concrete evidentiary proof, which the appellant failed to provide, and dismissed the appeal.",
