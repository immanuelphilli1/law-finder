  "summary": "This 1935 West African Court of Appeal decision in Ghana concerned a land trespass dispute between Kobina Ababio II, Ohene of Brenu, and the Catholic Mission and Ohene Tekyi Akyin III representing the Ampenyi Stool. The case centered on ownership and possession of land known as Ebutukul/Abutuku. Previous judgments involving ancestors of the parties were admitted not as res judicata but as evidence of continuous possession by the Brenu Akyinm people. The Appeal Court upheld the Divisional Court's ruling in favor of the plaintiff, finding that prior judicial decisions and acts of possession supported the plaintiff's claim. The appellants' arguments regarding inadmissibility of evidence, rejection of testimony, and weight of evidence were rejected. The appeal was dismissed, affirming damages and an injunction against further trespass.",
