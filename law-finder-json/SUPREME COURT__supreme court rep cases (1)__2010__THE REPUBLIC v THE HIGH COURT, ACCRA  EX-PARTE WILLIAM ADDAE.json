  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC v THE HIGH COURT, ACCRA EX-PARTE WILLIAM ADDAE",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana, in an ex-parte application brought by William Addae-Atcheewerebuo and others, exercised its supervisory jurisdiction to quash an interlocutory injunction issued by the High Court, Accra, which had restrained the inauguration and operation of the Biakoye District Assembly. The Applicants, who were elected Assembly members for electoral areas within the new district, were not parties to the original suit filed by traditional leaders challenging the designation of Nkonya-Ahenkro as the district capital. The Supreme Court held that the High Court lacked jurisdiction under Article 130(1)(b) of the 1992 Constitution to invalidate legislative instruments or restrain executive actions related to district creation. It further ruled that the Applicants' cause of action arose only on 13 May 2009, when a new injunction directly affected them, making their 15 June 2009 application timely under Rule 62 of CI 16. The Court rejected a preliminary objection on delay, emphasizing that lack of service on the Applicants prior to that date negated any argument of laches. The orders of the High Court were declared ultra vires and set aside.",
