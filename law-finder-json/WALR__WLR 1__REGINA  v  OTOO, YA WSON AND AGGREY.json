  "caseTitle": "REGINA v OTOO, YA WSON AND AGGREY",
  "summary": "The appellants, public officers, were convicted of conspiracy to extort and corruption under the Gold Coast Criminal Code. The prosecution proved they demanded £100 from the complainant under threats of reporting alleged irregularities and initiating criminal proceedings. The appellants claimed the money was an unsolicited bribe they rejected. The West African Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, ruling that extortion under the Gold Coast Code does not require the officer to have purported to act under lawful authority (distinguishing Nigerian jurisprudence). It further held that corruption occurs when a public officer agrees to allow conduct to be influenced by a benefit, regardless of who initiated the exchange. The court affirmed that the trial judge did not misdirect himself and that the elements of both offences were satisfied.",
