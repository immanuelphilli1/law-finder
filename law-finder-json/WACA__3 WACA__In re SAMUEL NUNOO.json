  "caseTitle": "REX VERSUS JONATHAN ADE OLUJOMOYE AND ANOTHER",
  "summary": "Samuel Nunoo, a witness at the Assizes in Accra, was sentenced to six months' imprisonment with hard labour for perjury under section 139 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The presiding judge summarily convicted him without recalling witnesses or specifying the exact false statements, citing willful and corrupt perjury. Nunoo appealed on grounds that there was no recorded evidence to justify the conviction and that the charge lacked specificity. The West African Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that the procedure under section 139 is summary in nature and does not require formal trial processes. Relying on Privy Council precedent in *Chang Hang Kin v. The Judges of the Supreme Court of Hong Kong*, the court ruled that while specifying false statements is desirable, it is sufficient if the accused understands the gist of the accusation. Given that Nunoo’s testimony concerned only one incident—alleged police visitation—and the contradiction with police testimony was clear, the court found he was adequately aware of the charge. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the summary contempt power of the court.",
