  "summary": "This 1939 West African Court of Appeal decision addressed a motion to approve sureties for an appeal to the Privy Council. The appellant, Kwami Baisie, sought to vary an order requiring service of notice on all respondents, having only served one respondent and one solicitor. The court held that under the West African Court of Appeal Rules (1937), service on a party's solicitor is not equivalent to service on the party itself, and strict compliance with service requirements was necessary. As the condition of service on all respondents was not met, the application was refused with costs assessed at £1 10s. 6d.",
