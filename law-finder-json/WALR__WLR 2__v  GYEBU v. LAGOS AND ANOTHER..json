  "caseTitle": "GYEBU VERSUS LAGOS AND ANOTHER.",
  "summary": "In GYEBU v. LAGOS AND ANOTHER, the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast addressed the validity of a property sale conducted in execution of a judgment after the judgment-debtor's death, without court leave or substitution of the deceased. The court held that execution could only issue against the estate or legal representative of a deceased judgment-debtor with court leave. The failure to obtain leave and effect substitution rendered the execution, sale, and certificates of purchase nullities, as the court acted without jurisdiction. The defendants' argument that the defect was a mere irregularity under Order 51, Rules 18 and 19, was rejected because the flaw preceded the sale. The appeal was allowed, annulling the sale and restoring title to the plaintiff.",
