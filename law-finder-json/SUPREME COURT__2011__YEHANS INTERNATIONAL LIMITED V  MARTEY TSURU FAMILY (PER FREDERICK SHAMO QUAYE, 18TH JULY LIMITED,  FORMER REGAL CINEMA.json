  "caseTitle": "YEHANS INTERNATIONAL LIMITED V MARTEY TSURU FAMILY (PER FREDERICK SHAMO QUAYE, 18TH JULY LIMITED, FORMER REGAL CINEMA",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an interlocutory appeal filed by 18th July Limited (formerly Regal Cinema), the second defendant and appellant, against Yehans International Limited, the plaintiff and respondent, in a land dispute concerning a property at Light Industrial Area, Accra. The original action involved a claim for declaration of title and ancillary reliefs, including an interlocutory injunction. The High Court granted the injunction based on an affidavit by a law clerk who disclosed the source of information, which the Supreme Court upheld as compliant with Order 20 Rule 8(2) of C147. The appellant challenged the capacity of the deponent and the Court of Appeal's failure to consider balance of hardships, but the Supreme Court found that both the High Court and Court of Appeal properly applied established principles governing interlocutory injunctions, including maintaining the status quo, preventing irreparable harm, and weighing convenience. The Court also affirmed that the discretion to require undertakings as to damages lies with the court, citing Republic v High Court, Koforidua, Ex Parte Ansa-Otu [2009] SCGLR 141. Finding no error in law or fact, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal as meritless.",
