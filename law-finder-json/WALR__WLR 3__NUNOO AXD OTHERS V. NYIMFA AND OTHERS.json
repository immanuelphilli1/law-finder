  "caseTitle": "AXD OTHERS VERSUS NYIMFA AND OTHERS",
  "summary": "In Nunoo and Others v. Nyimfa and Others, the plaintiffs sought specific performance of an agreement to execute a lease over Apam Stool land. The agreement, made during a concession inquiry, provided for a new lease to be drafted and approved by the parties, with the plaintiffs remaining in possession pending execution. The High Court held that the agreement was complete and enforceable as a binding contract supported by consideration, despite clause 9 requiring final approval of the lease draft. It was not a 'concession' under the Concessions Ordinance, c. 136, as it did not constitute a grant or demise of land. Nor was it a 'disposal' under the Local Government Ordinance, c. 64, s. 75, as it did not transfer an interest in land for valuable consideration at that stage. However, the court found that because the agreement allowed the plaintiffs to remain in possession pending execution of the formal lease, it amounted to a purported alienation of stool property under the State Councils (Southern Ghana) Ordinance, c. 8 of 1952, s. 16, which required state council consent. As such consent was not obtained, the agreement was declared null and void. The court also held that where an agreement to convey land is subject to statutory consents, there is an implied term that both parties must take steps to obtain those consents, and a party cannot rely on the absence of consent if they have not sought it.",
