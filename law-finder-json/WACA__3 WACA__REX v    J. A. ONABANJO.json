  "caseTitle": "REX v J. A. ONABANJO",
  "summary": "The appellant, J. A. Onabanjo, was convicted of stealing goods worth �615 15s. from his employers, John Holt & Co. Ltd., while working as a storekeeper. The prosecution sought to admit a written statement he signed during an investigation. Initially marked for identification only, the trial judge admitted it after the close of evidence, finding it was made voluntarily. The appellant claimed he was induced to sign by a promise that his store would be reopened, but the trial judge disbelieved this. On appeal, it was argued that the statement was inadmissible due to improper timing of the admissibility ruling and alleged inducement. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that although the trial judge should have ruled on admissibility when the statement was first tendered, the delay did not prejudice the appellant, especially since he did not request to reopen his defence. The court found no evidence of threats or coercion and upheld the trial judge's credibility assessment. It concluded that the statement was properly admitted and that the conviction was supported by ample evidence, dismissing the appeal.",
