  "caseTitle": "YUNGDONG INDUSTRIES v RORO SERVICES & 2 ORS",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision arose from a dispute over ownership of 18 containers of goods shipped from Korea and detained at Tema Port. The plaintiff, Yungdong Industries, claimed entitlement as consignee under bills of lading and sought release of the goods, an injunction against their release to others, and damages for wrongful detention. The defendants, Roro Services (the carrier), initially defended on the basis of instructions from the consignors to reconsign the goods to Seo-Kwang Ghana Ltd, a company linked to the suppliers. After procedural complexities involving joinder, withdrawal, and replacement of parties—including the eventual joining of individual appellants Eun Mook Bang and Young Chul Choi—the core issues centered on whether title had passed to the plaintiff, the validity of reconsignment, and the carrier’s right to a lien for demurrage. The court held that title vested in the plaintiff upon shipment, rendering unilateral reconsignment ineffective. It rejected claims of fraud against the plaintiff due to lack of credible evidence. However, it upheld the carrier’s statutory and contractual lien over the goods for unpaid demurrage and administrative charges totaling ₵134,062,068 as of July 1994. The judgment reinforced the principle that parties must adhere to their pleadings and cannot advance inconsistent theories at trial.",
