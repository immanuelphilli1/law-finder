  "caseTitle": "YUNGDONG INDUSTRIES v RORO SERVICES & 2 ORS",
  "summary": "The case involved a dispute over ownership and entitlement to 18 containers of goods shipped from Korea to Ghana, originally consigned to the plaintiff, Yungdong Industries. The defendant carrier, Roro Services, altered the bills of lading at the request of the consignors to reconsign the goods to Seo-Kwang Ghana Ltd, a newly incorporated company linked to the appellants Eun Mook Bang and Young Chul Choi. The plaintiff claimed title as the original consignee and sought release of the goods, while the co-defendants asserted they were unpaid sellers who had financed the shipment and reconsigned the goods due to the plaintiff's non-payment and fraudulent misrepresentations about its business capacity. The trial court initially joined Seo-Kwang Ghana Ltd, which later withdrew, and new appellants were added personally. The Supreme Court ultimately determined that the plaintiff failed to prove ownership or payment for the goods, while the appellants demonstrated they had financed the shipments and were entitled as unpaid sellers to reconsign the goods. The appeal was allowed, with the defendants' lien for demurrage charges upheld.",
