  "caseTitle": "REGINA v ABISA GRUNSHIE",
  "summary": "In Regina v Abisa Grunshie, the West African Court of Appeal quashed the appellant's murder conviction due to a misdirection on the burden of proof and failure to properly consider the defence of accident. The trial judge erred by dismissing the appellant's account without directing the assessors that an unproven defence creating reasonable doubt necessitates acquittal. The appellant claimed the deceased died from a fall during a scuffle, not a deliberate axe blow, a version consistent with medical evidence. The court emphasized that where prosecution and defence accounts differ only narrowly, judges must clearly instruct on three principles: acquittal if the defence is accepted, if it raises doubt, or if guilt is not proven beyond reasonable doubt. Additionally, the court condemned the police for obtaining a voluntary statement from an illiterate accused in a murder case without an independent civilian witness or appropriate linguistic safeguards, rendering the confession suspect. No cautionary instruction was given on this unreliable evidence, further prejudicing the trial. Applying R. v. Murtagh & Kennedy, the appeal was allowed, and the appellant acquitted.",
