  "summary": "This appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal on 24 April 1937 arose from a civil action in the native Tribunal of Ayeldu, where Kwesi Kwaa sought to set aside a prior judgment awarding him ancestral land to Kofi Kwakwa on grounds of lack of jurisdiction, irregularity, mistake, and fraud. The native tribunal dismissed the claim, but the Provincial Commissioner's Court allowed the appeal, declaring the original judgment a nullity due to jurisdictional overreach. The West Africa Court of Appeal reversed this decision, holding that a judgment regularly obtained cannot be impeached in a subsequent action solely because the subject land was later found outside the tribunal's jurisdiction. It emphasized that only superior courts can quash judgments via certiorari for excess of jurisdiction and that lower tribunals lack inherent power to set aside their own valid judgments. The appeal was allowed, the Provincial Commissioner’s judgment was set aside, and the original judgment of the Ayeldu Tribunal was restored.",
