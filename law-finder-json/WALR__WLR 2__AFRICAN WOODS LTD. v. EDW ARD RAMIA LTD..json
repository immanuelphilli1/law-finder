  "summary": "In *African Woods Ltd. v. Edward Ramia Ltd.*, the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast, Ashanti Judicial Division, Land Court, Kumasi, presided over by Benson J, considered the validity of a timber concession granted to African Woods Ltd. over land that had previously been subject to an agreement with Edward Ramia Ltd. The prior agreement failed to comply with s.12 of the Concessions Ordinance, c.136, as it was not executed before a government agent, and was thus declared invalid by the West African Court of Appeal. African Woods' concession, though formally compliant, was challenged on multiple grounds. The court held that while a prior invalid agreement does not automatically bar a subsequent concession, the grantors' misapprehension about the land's status was fatal. The Omanhene Bekwai testified he would not have granted the concession had he known the land was already leased. The court ruled that such misunderstanding of obligations precluded validation under s.13(2), as the grantors did not fully understand the nature and terms of the concession. Additionally, the court emphasized that government agents must not offer legal opinions on prior agreements, as this may mislead grantors. The claim for a certificate of validity was disallowed, costs awarded to the opposers, and the concession declared invalid.",
