  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision addresses the devolution of a deceased person's estate and the rights of beneficiaries prior to the grant of vesting assent. The court held that upon death, whether testate or intestate, the estate vests in the executor or personal representative until a vesting assent is granted, at which point beneficiaries gain legal title. Until then, beneficiaries lack locus standi over the estate. However, recognizing potential abuse or neglect by executors, the court affirmed that beneficiaries or family members may bring legal action based on their 'expectant interest' to protect the estate from dissipation or misuse. Such actions may include compelling the executor to act or seeking court appointment of a new administrator. This equitable principle applies to both testate and intestate estates, ensuring protection of inheritance rights even before formal vesting.",
