  "caseTitle": "FARAGE VERSUS DAVIES.",
  "summary": "In Farage v. Davies, the plaintiff sought to recover £548 under a mortgage deed, claiming he had supplied goods of that value to the defendant. The defendant countered that the amount represented a cash loan of £400 plus £108 in interest and £40 in legal fees. The Chief Justice found the defendant's account credible, concluding that the transaction was a loan, not a sale of goods. The court held that the plaintiff was presumed to be a moneylender under section 3 of the Moneylenders Ordinance, c. 178, and had not rebutted this presumption. Furthermore, the mortgage deed failed to comply with section 12 of the Ordinance, as it did not serve as a proper memorandum specifying the principal, interest rate, or interest amount. Consequently, the mortgage was deemed unenforceable, and judgment was entered for the defendant with costs.",
