  "caseTitle": "CONCEPT AND PROBLEMS OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY UNDER GHANA LA",
  "summary": "This legal analysis by Justice JNK Taylor examines the evolution of public accountability in Ghana across pre-colonial, colonial, and post-independence eras. It defines public accountability as the legal scrutiny of state conduct to enforce compliance with the law, with the judiciary as the key enforcer. The paper highlights limitations, such as the non-justiciability of political acts and legislative immunity. In the pre-colonial era, accountability was weak and based on customary norms. Colonial rule introduced British legal principles, subordinating customary law to 'natural justice, equity and good conscience.' Post-independence, especially after the 1960 Republican Constitution, customary law was fully integrated into national law. Key cases like Re Akoto and Tinieye v The Republic illustrate tensions between executive power and judicial oversight, with Re Akoto's deference to preventive detention later reversed by statutory reform affirming habeas corpus rights.",
