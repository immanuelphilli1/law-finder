  "summary": "This 1941 West African Court of Appeal decision addressed a jurisdictional challenge arising from an order by the Divisional Court directing payment of funds held in court to the head of a family, following a determination by the Ga Manche Tribunal that certain properties devised by will were family property and not part of the deceased's personal estate. The executors had appealed the Divisional Court's order, arguing lack of jurisdiction after the main action was referred to a customary tribunal. The appellate court dismissed the appeal, affirming that the Divisional Court retained jurisdiction to make ancillary orders necessary for justice, citing the principle that all court orders inherently carry the liberty to apply for further directions. The court emphasized that the original receiver's appointment and fund-holding order was not final and required a subsequent disbursement order, which the court was competent to issue even after referral to the Ga Manche Tribunal.",
