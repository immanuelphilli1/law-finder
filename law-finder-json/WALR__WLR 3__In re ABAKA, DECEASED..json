  "caseTitle": "In re ABAKA, DECEASED.",
  "summary": "In this 1957 Ghanaian probate case, the High Court considered the validity of a will drawn in English form by James Kofi Abaka, deceased. The will spanned four pages, with only the first page containing the testator's and witnesses' signatures. Adumua-Bossman J. held that the document, being in English form, was governed by the Wills Act, 1837, and the Wills Act Amendment Act, 1852, which require a will to be signed at its foot or end. As only the first page met these formalities, probate was granted solely for that portion. The remaining three pages, lacking signatures, were deemed defectively executed and excluded. The court affirmed two categories of valid wills in Ghana: those compliant with English law and those valid under native customary law (e.g., oral nuncupative wills). However, since this was not a customary will, native rules did not apply. The ruling emphasized strict compliance with statutory formalities for written wills and highlighted the distinction between written and customary testamentary dispositions. A postscript noted that the intestate successors and intended beneficiaries had reached an equitable customary agreement on estate distribution, which the court appended to its judgment.",
