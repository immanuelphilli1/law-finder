  "summary": "In this civil appeal before the West African Court of Appeal in Ghana, Eliza Morris, the plaintiff-respondent, claimed reimbursement of \t4 she contributed toward the construction of a house built during her long-term concubinage with John Weatu, who had died intestate. The trial court had awarded her the amount, finding her contribution proven. On appeal, the decision was reversed. The appellate court held that, in the absence of an express or implied agreement to repay, and given the domestic relationship between the parties, the financial contribution was presumed to be a gift. The court emphasized that a claim against a deceased's estate cannot be sustained solely on the claimant's uncorroborated testimony. Although the plaintiff suggested the funds were loaned, no evidence showed that repayment was ever discussed or expected. The court also noted that Fanti customary law, which treats such contributions as irrecoverable, did not apply as the parties were of the Kroo tribe, but found English law principles equally supported the conclusion that the money was a gift. Thus, the judgment for the plaintiff was set aside and judgment entered for the defendant-administrator.",
