  "summary": "In this 1939 West Africa Court of Appeal case from Accra, the court interpreted Clause 2 of a will concerning \"Ali's land.\" The testator left the land \"in the charge of\" three individuals, mirroring language used in Clause 1 regarding a house where beneficial interest was clearly intended, as evidenced by the direction to divide rents equally. The majority held that the phrase \"in the charge of\" should be interpreted consistently, granting the named individuals beneficial ownership of the land, not a trustee role. This reversed the lower court's finding of partial intestacy. The dissent argued that without explicit disposal directions, the phrase did not convey a beneficial interest. The appeal succeeded on construction grounds, making consideration of limitation statutes unnecessary.",
