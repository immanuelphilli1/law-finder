  "caseTitle": "ANTHONY KWABENA ANYAN v THE HIGH COURT, ACCRA",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an application by Anthony Kwabena Anyan seeking certiorari to quash part of a High Court ruling that he had no interest in property attached during execution proceedings. The applicant, a sub-lessee under Edward Nassar & Co. Ltd, claimed ownership of land wrongfully seized in an interpleader action initiated after Platinum Holdings obtained judgment over a different plot. The High Court had ruled the execution was improper and further held that the applicant’s lease expired when the head lease ended in October 2007, rendering his interest void. The Supreme Court found that the trial judge acted within jurisdiction by assessing the applicant's title, as it was inherently in issue in the interpleader. It emphasized that supervisory jurisdiction under Article 132 of the Constitution applies only to patent errors going to jurisdiction, not mere errors correctable by appeal. The case underscores the limits of certiorari and the proper use of interpleader actions.",
