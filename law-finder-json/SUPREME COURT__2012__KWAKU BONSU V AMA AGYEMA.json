  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision in Kwaku Bonsu v. Ama Agyemang (2012) addresses the legal principles governing the remedy of specific performance in land sale contracts. The plaintiff-appellant sought specific performance of a 2007 agreement for land at Achimota, which the High Court granted, but the Court of Appeal substituted with damages. The Supreme Court reinstated the specific performance order, holding that land is inherently unique and damages are presumed inadequate unless exceptional circumstances exist. The Court rejected the Court of Appeal's reasoning that damages could suffice, emphasizing that specific performance is the primary equitable remedy for breach of land contracts, absent recognized grounds for denial such as fraud, undue influence, or inadequacy of consideration. The decision reaffirms the discretionary yet rule-bound nature of equitable remedies in Ghanaian property law.",
