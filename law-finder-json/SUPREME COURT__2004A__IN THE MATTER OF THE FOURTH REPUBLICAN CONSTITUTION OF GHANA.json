  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana, exercising its original jurisdiction, interpreted Articles 47(1), (5), (6), and 113 of the 1992 Constitution regarding the Electoral Commission's decision to include 30 newly created constituencies in the December 2004 general elections. The plaintiff, Luke Mensah, sought a declaration that the Electoral Commission (EC) was constitutionally justified in including the new constituencies. Although the plaintiff's case had procedural defects, the court proceeded due to the significant public interest. The court held that while the EC has the constitutional authority under Articles 45 and 47 to demarcate and alter constituencies via a Constitutional Instrument (C.I. 46), such alterations do not take immediate effect. Article 47(6) mandates that boundary changes come into force only upon the next dissolution of Parliament. Therefore, the 30 new constituencies, though legally created by C.I. 46, could not participate in the 2004 elections but would become operational in the subsequent parliamentary term. The court rejected arguments for immediate implementation, emphasizing that retroactive application would violate Article 107. The judgment upheld constitutional order, clarity, and the rule of law in electoral processes.",
