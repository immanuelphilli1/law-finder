  "summary": "In AFOLABI v. BLAMA AND ONAOLAKPO, the plaintiff and his deceased brother entered into a licensing agreement with the defendant, who acted as caretaker of stool lands, granting them rights to mine for diamonds along the Akwabusu Stream. It was later discovered that the land was within a pre-existing mining concession held by a company, rendering the area ineligible for a new mining licence. The court held that an implied condition in the agreement was that the land was free from prior conflicting rights. Since this condition was breached, the defendant was found liable for damages. Although the claim for fraudulent misrepresentation was not substantiated, the court awarded the plaintiff £1,101 for expenses incurred due to the breach of the implied condition.",
