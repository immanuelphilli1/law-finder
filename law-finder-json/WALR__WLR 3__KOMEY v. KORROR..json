  "caseTitle": "KOMEY VERSUS KORROR.",
  "summary": "In Komey v. Korror (1958), the High Court of Ghana's Eastern Judicial Division ruled that a stool cannot lawfully forfeit a determinable estate granted for building purposes without first providing the grantee with due notice and opportunities to remedy the breach. The plaintiff had been granted usufructuary rights to Asere Stool land in 1946 but did not build. In 1952, the caretaker re-granted the same land to the defendant without properly notifying the plaintiff or allowing him time to comply with the building condition. The court held that native custom required at least two warnings and a chance to build before forfeiture, rendering the re-grant invalid. The plaintiff's title was upheld, and the defendant's entry constituted trespass, entitling the plaintiff to damages of £25.",
