  "caseTitle": "ANTHONY KWABENA ANYAN v THE HIGH COURT, ACCRA",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an application by Anthony Kwabena Anyan seeking certiorari to quash part of a High Court ruling that he had no interest in property attached in execution. The applicant, a sub-lessee under Edward Nassar & Co. Ltd, claimed the attached land was not the one subject to judgment and asserted ownership via a 99-year lease. The High Court had ruled the execution was wrongful and further held the applicant's interest lapsed when the head lease expired in 2007. The Supreme Court held that by initiating interpleader proceedings, the applicant placed his title in issue, thus authorizing the trial court to rule on it. It found no jurisdictional error or excess, emphasizing that certiorari applies only to patent legal errors rendering decisions nullities. The proper remedy for non-jurisdictional errors is appeal. The court also corrected the case title to 'The Republic v High Court, Accra; Ex-parte: Anthony Kwabena Anyan' under Article 129(4) to align with standard practice. The application was dismissed.",
