  "caseTitle": "REX v HARRY, ADINDU EWUNONU",
  "summary": "The appellants were convicted of the murder of a boy named Unaeze, with the prosecution relying heavily on a dying declaration made by the victim during a brief period of lucidity amid delirium. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that the dying declaration was inadmissible because there was no evidence that the deceased believed he was about to die at the time, as required under Section 61 of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance. Furthermore, the court noted a critical inconsistency: while eyewitnesses described a bright moonlit night, the moon was only four days old and thus could not have provided significant light, casting doubt on witness credibility and supporting the defense's claim of a conspiracy. Given the inadmissibility of the dying declaration and the flawed evidentiary basis, the court concluded that the trial judge could not inevitably have reached the same verdict absent these errors. Consequently, the appeals were allowed, convictions quashed, and acquittals entered.",
