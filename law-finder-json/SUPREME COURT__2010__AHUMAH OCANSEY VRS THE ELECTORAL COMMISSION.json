  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF CONSOLIDATED SUITS: WRIT NO",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana, in a consolidated suit involving Ahumah Ocansey and the Centre for Human Rights & Civil Liberties (CHURCIL) against the Electoral Commission and the Attorney-General, addressed the constitutional right of prisoners—particularly remand and convicted prisoners—to vote in public elections under Article 42 of the 1992 Constitution. The plaintiffs challenged Section 7(5) of the Representation of the People Law, PNDCL 284, which disqualified detention centers as places of residence for voter registration, thereby disenfranchising prisoners. The court held that this provision was inconsistent with constitutional guarantees of the right to vote and affirmed that remand prisoners retain their voting rights unless lawfully disqualified. The judgment emphasized the importance of protecting fundamental rights, even in the face of logistical challenges, and rejected the argument that the case was moot despite the 2008 elections having passed, citing the recurring nature of elections and detention. The court ultimately declared Section 7(5) unconstitutional to the extent it denied remand prisoners the right to vote.",
