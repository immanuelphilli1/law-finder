  "caseTitle": "Ribeiro v Ribeiro2 in reserved",
  "summary": "In Ribeiro v Ribeiro, the Supreme Court of Ghana delivered a split decision (3-2) on the interpretation of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1971 (Act 367), particularly regarding the court's power to rescind property dispositions made to defeat financial claims and to award financial provision. The wife, Barbara Ribeiro, successfully obtained a decree of divorce and sought financial relief, including property reassignment and maintenance. The High Court ordered the husband, Charles Ribeiro, to convey 'Haulage House' to her and pay �150,000, citing his transfer of the property to his new wife during proceedings as a bad-faith attempt to defeat her claim. The Court of Appeal upheld this decision. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' rulings by majority, recognizing broad judicial discretion under sections 20 and 26 of Act 367. However, two justices dissented, arguing that courts lack authority to transfer property in which the spouse holds no title and that financial provision should be limited to monetary awards.",
