  "summary": "This 1956 Gambian Supreme Court decision, Chief Superintendent of Police v. Michalski, interpreted the term 'special reasons' under section 48(2) of the Motor Traffic Ordinance, c. 155. The respondent was convicted of driving under the influence of drink and fined, but the magistrate did not disqualify him from driving, citing his employment duties as a 'special reason.' The court held that 'special reasons' must relate to the circumstances of the offence itself, not to personal or occupational hardships of the offender. Relying on the English precedent Whittall v. Kirby [1947] K.B. 194, the court ruled that inconvenience to the employer or the risk of job loss does not constitute a 'special reason' justifying non-disqualification. The appeal was allowed, and the case was remitted for imposition of a mandatory disqualification of at least twelve months.",
