  "caseTitle": "KWEKU DANSO",
  "summary": "This 1930 West African Court of Appeal decision involved an interpleader application by Chief Kweku Danso, who opposed a writ of possession granted to Chief Kuturka Yardom following a prior land boundary judgment. Chief Danso claimed occupation of land included in the writ and sought protection under Order XLV Rule 5 of the Rules of the Supreme Court. The lower court registered his application as a suit and stayed execution. The appellate court reversed, holding that Danso had not been dispossessed and thus his application was premature under Rule 5, which requires actual dispossession. The appeal was allowed, costs were reduced, and the lower court was directed to proceed accordingly.",
