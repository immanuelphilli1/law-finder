  "caseTitle": "SUB MATTER UCSUGC",
  "summary": "This document compiles summaries of unreported Ghanaian legal cases from 2000–2010, primarily heard by the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal. Key issues include estate administration disputes where res judicata barred relitigation of prior rulings on family entitlement to administer estates. Other cases involve contractual disputes over dealership agreements and property sales, with courts assessing claims for specific performance, wrongful termination, and interpretation of agreements. Administrative law principles were applied in a case involving abuse of judicial process, where the High Court's jurisdiction was challenged post-judgment. Additionally, a military case addressed charges of striking a superior officer and conduct prejudicial to discipline. Procedural aspects such as caveats in estate matters, garnishee proceedings for judgment debts, and the admissibility of party-witnesses were also examined.",
