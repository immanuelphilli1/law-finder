  "caseTitle": "CHAPEL HILL SCHOOL LTD v THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE COMMISSI",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana considered whether Chapel Hill School Ltd., a privately established and later incorporated school, qualified as an 'educational institution of a public character' under the Income Tax Act 1975 (SMCD 5) and the Internal Revenue Act, 2000 (Act 592), thereby entitling it to tax exemption. The Court found that the lower courts erred in equating 'public character' with 'public ownership' or relying on dictionary definitions of 'public school.' Instead, it held that an institution can be of public character even if privately owned, provided it serves the public and its income or assets do not confer private benefit. Drawing on Privy Council jurisprudence in Dilworth and principles from English charity law, the Court emphasized that public benefit and the absence of private gain are central to determining public character. It also applied the noscitur a sociis rule, noting that 'educational institution' should be interpreted in light of 'religious' and 'charitable' institutions, which are often privately managed. The case was remitted for determination of whether the school met the statutory criteria, particularly regarding private benefit and its corporate structure post-2001.",
