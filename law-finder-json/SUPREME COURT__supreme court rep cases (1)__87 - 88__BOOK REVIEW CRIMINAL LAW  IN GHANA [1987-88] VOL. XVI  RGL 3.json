  "summary": "This book review from the 1987-88 Review of Ghana Law highlights Mr. Justice Twumasi's seminal work, 'Criminal Law in Ghana' (1985), as the first comprehensive textbook on substantive criminal law in Ghana since the establishment of the Law School. The 634-page volume systematically covers core criminal offences, including treason, murder, theft, bigamy, contempt, libel, corruption, and economic crimes, while also addressing lesser-included offences like trial by ordeal and slave-dealing. The author draws primarily on local case law and statutory provisions, supplemented by English and Commonwealth authorities where local precedents are lacking. Despite publication delays that excluded recent cases, the work is praised for making the Criminal Code (Act 29) more accessible and for serving as a foundational text for judges, legal practitioners, law students, and law enforcement. A follow-up volume on criminal procedure and evidence is anticipated.",
