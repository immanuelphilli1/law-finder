  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision addresses a civil appeal in an estate matter involving conflicting roles of joint administrators. The plaintiffs, beneficiaries of an estate, sued the defendant and initially included the co-plaintiff as a defendant due to his role as co-administrator. The High Court struck out the co-plaintiff as a defendant and joined him as a co-plaintiff, a decision not appealed. During trial, the defendant objected to the co-plaintiff testifying, citing lack of pleading and renunciation of administration. The Supreme Court held that a party is competent to testify unless legally disqualified, and the objection went to admissibility, not competence. Relying on precedents like Hayford v Moses and Acquaah v Larbi, the Court affirmed that joint administrators are not always required to act in unison, especially when their interests conflict. The Court upheld the procedural validity of reconstituting parties under Order 15 r 6 of the High Court Rules and dismissed the appeal, affirming the trial court's discretion in managing party roles and evidence.",
