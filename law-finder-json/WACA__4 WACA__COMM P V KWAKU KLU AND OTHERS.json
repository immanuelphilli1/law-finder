  "summary": "This 1938 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Accra involved fifty-eight individuals charged with unlawful assembly under section 346 of Cap. 29 for actions on October 24, 1937, at Krachikrom. The Magistrate convicted fifty-four, while four were later acquitted. Although the charge was unlawful assembly, the Magistrate's judgment recorded a conviction for riot, an uncharged offense. The Supreme Court dismissed appeals by all fifty-eight. On further appeal, the West Africa Court of Appeal struck out the appeals of the four unconvicted individuals and corrected the legal error in the convictions of the remaining fifty-four by altering the finding to 'guilty of the offence charged' under sections 319 and 326 of Cap. 10, while upholding the original sentences of a fine of £5 or three months' imprisonment.",
