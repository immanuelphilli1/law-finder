  "summary": "This 1934 West Africa Court of Appeal case centered on a dispute over control of a mosque in Aroloya Street, Lagos, between two Muslim groups: the Alqurani Muslims, who believe solely in the Koran, and the Ahmadis. The land for the mosque was originally conveyed in 1879 to Alimami Ali Afanya and his successors as head priests, and to all Alqurani Muslims worshipping there, for the purpose of establishing a place of worship according to their beliefs. The defendants claimed that in 1921, the entire community converted to the Ahmadi movement, thereby transferring control. However, the court found that the trial judge erred in concluding that all members, without exception, had converted, noting that conversion is a personal act and cannot be effected by proxy. The appellants, who identified as Alqurani Muslims, were found to retain ownership and control rights under the original trust, as no valid legal basis—such as estoppel or prescription—was established to divest them of those rights. The appeal was allowed, restoring the mosque to the Alqurani community.",
