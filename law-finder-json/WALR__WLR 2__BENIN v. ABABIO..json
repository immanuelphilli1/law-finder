  "caseTitle": "BENIN VERSUS ABABIO.",
  "summary": "The plaintiff, a purchaser of land sold in execution of a judgment debt, brought an action in the Land Court of the Supreme Court to recover possession. The defendant, a native, claimed the land was stool property and the sale was void under the Stool Property Protection Ordinance, c. 101 of 1951. The trial judge held the sale valid but referred the parties to a Native Court, finding the dispute was between natives over land possession. On appeal, the West African Court of Appeal held that while the referral to the Native Court was correct due to statutory ouster of Land Court jurisdiction under s.18(b) of the Courts Ordinance and s.35 of the Native Courts (Ashanti) Ordinance, the trial judge erred by adjudicating on the validity of the sale before referral. Such adjudication was declared a nullity. The appeal was allowed in part, with costs to be borne by each party.",
