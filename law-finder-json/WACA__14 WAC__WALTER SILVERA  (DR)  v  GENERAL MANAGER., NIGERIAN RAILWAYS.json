  "caseTitle": "WALTER SILVERA (DR) v GENERAL MANAGER., NIGERIAN RAILWAYS",
  "summary": "This case arose from a nighttime collision at a dangerous level crossing in Ibadan, where Dr. Walter Silvera's car was struck by a slowly moving goods train. The crossing had a 'STOP DANGEROUS LEVEL CROSSING' sign, which the appellant knew about but ignored. Although the train used a kerosene lamp instead of a standard electric light and ceased whistling before reaching the crossing—factors that reduced visibility and auditory warning—the appellate court held that the appellant's own failure to stop constituted contributory negligence. The court acknowledged that the railway may have breached its duty by not maintaining an adequate light or continuous whistle, but concluded that the appellant could have avoided the accident by stopping, as he would then have seen and heard the train. Since his injury resulted primarily from his own lack of reasonable care, the appeal was dismissed with costs.",
