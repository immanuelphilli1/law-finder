  "caseTitle": "WALTER LOEB",
  "summary": "In Walter Loeb v. Solomon Nasser, the West Africa Court of Appeal reviewed a claim for damages following the plaintiff's wrongful dismissal from a three-year engineering contract in Kumasi. The trial court awarded £249 0s. 8d., but the defendant appealed, arguing that the plaintiff’s refusal of re-employment rendered damages nominal. The appellate court upheld the finding of wrongful dismissal, emphasizing that refusal to accept re-employment is only detrimental if unreasonable, which was not established here. However, the court reversed part of the damages award, reducing it to £216 2s. 5d., after determining that the trial judge misinterpreted ledger entries that conclusively showed a £12 advance salary payment. The court also agreed to reduce the award for the wife’s passage by £20 18s. 3d., as conceded by the respondent. Costs were apportioned equally due to the partial success of the appeal.",
