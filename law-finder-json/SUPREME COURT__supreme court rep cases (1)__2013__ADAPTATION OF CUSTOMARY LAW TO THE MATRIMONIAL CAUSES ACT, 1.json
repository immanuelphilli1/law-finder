  "summary": "The case Adjei v. Foriwaa, heard by the High Court in Kumasi on 13 March 1980, addressed the adaptation of Akan customary law to the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1971 (Act 367), particularly regarding rights to the matrimonial home. The plaintiff, a customary-law wife, sought declarations on joint property, maintenance, and an injunction against ejection. The defendant, having married another woman, counter-petitioned for dissolution and ejection. The court consolidated proceedings and initially ordered reinstatement of the plaintiff and children, though only three children returned. Subsequently, due to ongoing conflict, the defendant sought good behaviour undertakings. The court held that customary law does not confer a personal right of occupation in the matrimonial home on a wife or children, especially where children belong to the mother's family. While courts may order accommodation for children's protection, continued residence is subject to good behaviour. The court exercised discretion under the Matrimonial Causes Act, concluding that the absence of a customary right allowed equitable intervention, ultimately ordering the children to vacate within 28 days. The decision clarified the interplay between statutory and customary law in marital disputes.",
