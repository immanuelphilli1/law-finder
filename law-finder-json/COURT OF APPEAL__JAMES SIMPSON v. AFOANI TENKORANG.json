  "caseTitle": "SIMPSON v. AFOANI TENKORANG",
  "summary": "In James Simpson v. Afoani Tenkorang, the appellant, a UK resident, remitted £5,000 to his brother-in-law (the respondent) in 1994 to purchase a residential plot in Accra and prepare building plans. The respondent used the funds as instructed, purchasing land from Nana Okanfra II at Kwabenya after a Lands Commission search and preparing an indenture. The appellant later visited Ghana, received the documents, supervised construction, and participated in material purchases. However, the structure was demolished by an adverse claimant, revealing a title defect. The appellant then sued for refund, initially claiming no land was purchased, but later arguing the purchase was invalid due to lack of prudence and non-compliance with registration. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, finding the respondent had fulfilled his obligations and the appellant's shifting positions amounted to approbation and reprobation. The court emphasized that the original instructions did not require a guaranteed marketable title, and thus the respondent was not liable for the adverse claim.",
