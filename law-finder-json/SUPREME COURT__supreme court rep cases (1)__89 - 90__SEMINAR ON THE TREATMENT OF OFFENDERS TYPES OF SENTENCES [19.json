  "caseTitle": "SEMINAR ON THE TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS TYPES OF SENTENCES [19",
  "summary": "This legal commentary by Her Ladyship Mrs. Akoto-Bamfo, delivered as a Circuit Judge and later Justice of the High Court of Ghana, outlines the types of sentences available under Ghanaian criminal law as of 1989–1990. It emphasizes that all sentences must be grounded in statute, with courts prohibited from exceeding prescribed penalties, as established in Republic v Addo [1974] GLR 254. The paper details various sentencing options including death, imprisonment, fines, probation, discharge, recognisance, compensation, and deportation. Mandatory death sentences apply to treason, murder, and aggravated piracy, though they cannot be imposed on juveniles or pregnant women. Imprisonment terms vary by offence classification—first-degree felonies carry life imprisonment, second-degree up to ten years, and misdemeanours up to three years. The commentary critiques outdated fines, lack of updated currency references, and calls for reform, including reclassification of offences, expanded use of non-custodial sentences like communal labour, and improved economic conditions to reduce crime.",
