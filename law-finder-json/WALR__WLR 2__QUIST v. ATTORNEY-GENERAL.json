  "caseTitle": "QUIST VERSUS ATTORNEY-GENERAL.",
  "summary": "In Quist v. Attorney-General, the plaintiff filed a petition of right seeking compensation for property damage caused by the Government's Electricity Department, which had excavated a hole near his house that remained open during rainfall, leading to subsidence. The claim was brought under section 3(6) of the Electricity Supply (Control) Ordinance, c. 66, which entitles persons injuriously affected by the exercise of statutory powers to compensation assessed in accordance with the Public Lands Ordinance, c. 134. The defendant argued the claim was statute-barred under both the Public Officers' Protection Ordinance, c. 27, s. 2, and the Public Lands Ordinance, s. 7, and that negligence was required. Ollennu J. held that the Public Officers' Protection Ordinance applies only to personal liability of officers, not the state, and that the limitation period for continuing damage does not begin until the damage ceases. Further, only sections 9 and 10 of the Public Lands Ordinance—governing assessment of compensation—were incorporated by reference, not the three-month claim deadline in section 7. The court emphasized that statutory compensation does not require proof of negligence, distinguishing it from tortious damages. The plaintiff’s claim was therefore valid and not time-barred.",
