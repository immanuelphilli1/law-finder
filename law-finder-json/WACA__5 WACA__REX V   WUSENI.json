  "caseTitle": "REX V WUSENI",
  "summary": "The appellant, Wuseni, was convicted of murder in the Circuit Court of the Protectorate of Sierra Leone before a judge and two assessors under Section 43 of the Protectorate Courts Jurisdiction Ordinance, 1932. On appeal, the main legal issue concerned the trial judge's failure to direct the assessors that the prosecution must prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that such a direction was immaterial because, under Section 43(3), the decision rests exclusively with the judge, who is presumed to know the legal standard. The court distinguished Rex v. Annan, where the trial judge appeared to rely on improperly guided assessors. Here, no such reliance was evident, and the conviction was upheld.",
