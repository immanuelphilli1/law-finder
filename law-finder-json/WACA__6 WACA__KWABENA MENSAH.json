  "caseTitle": "KWABENA MENSAH",
  "summary": "This 1940 West Africa Court of Appeal decision involved a land dispute between the head of a family and beneficiaries under a Will, concerning whether two plots were family or private property. The defendants argued that the dispute had been settled by arbitration before the Omanhene of Akwapim under native customary law in 1932, and that the plaintiff was bound by the award. The Divisional Court rejected this, citing concerns over English law applicability and statutory invalidity under the Native Administration and Arbitration Ordinances. The Appeal Court reversed, holding that the core issue—classification of land as family or private—was inherently a matter of native customary law, not English law, and thus suitable for customary arbitration. It ruled that Section 58 of the Native Administration Ordinance does not invalidate such awards but only restricts their enforcement through statutory tribunals. The award was binding *inter se* and could be used as estoppel. The appeal was allowed, the plaintiff's claim dismissed, and judgment entered for the defendants.",
