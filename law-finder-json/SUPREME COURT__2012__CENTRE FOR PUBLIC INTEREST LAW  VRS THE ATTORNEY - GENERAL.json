  "caseTitle": "CENTRE FOR PUBLIC INTEREST LAW VRS THE ATTORNEY - GENERAL",
  "summary": "The Centre for Public Interest Law sued the Attorney-General, challenging the constitutionality of the Master Facility Agreement between Ghana and the China Development Bank. The plaintiff sought declarations that the President breached constitutional obligations under Articles 40(a), 57(3), 58(1)-(4), 73, and 108, as well as Section 18(7) of the Petroleum Revenue Management Act, 2011 (Act 815), by submitting the agreement to Parliament without compliance. It was alleged that the agreement's requirement to use 60% of funds for Chinese contractors was discriminatory and prejudicial to Ghana’s economy, and that charging oil revenues for 15 years violated Act 815. The Supreme Court held that the agreement fell within international affairs under Article 73, and the 60% provision did not exclusively disadvantage Ghana, as it applied to contractors, not citizens, and did not preclude local participation. The Court found the action partly premature but admissible under the quia timet principle. It upheld the constitutionality of the loan, noting executive discretion in international agreements and the separation of powers. Claims relating to presidential removal were struck out as mischievous, and the judiciary affirmed its power to review executive actions within constitutional limits.",
