  "caseTitle": "GOLDEN GRACE LIMITED VRS TAKORADI FLOUR MILLS LIMITED",
  "summary": "Golden Grace Limited, a registered distributor of flour supplied by Takoradi Flour Mills Limited, surrendered several property title documents to the latter as security for increased flour supply. However, no additional supply was made due to existing indebtedness. When the plaintiff demanded the return of its documents, the defendant claimed they had been returned following settlement of the debt. The High Court found in favor of the defendant, a decision upheld by the Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court considered whether the evidence supported the return of all documents, particularly the original title to House No. 327/1 Ashanti Road, Cape Coast, which was not returned but replaced with a certified true copy. The appellant argued that the continued retention of the original document caused loss and that a certified copy did not satisfy legal requirements under Section 10(3) of the Mortgages Decree, 1972 (NRCD 96). The Supreme Court examined the nature of the deposit—whether for past debt or future supply—and found inconsistencies in the lower courts’ reasoning regarding both factual findings and legal application.",
