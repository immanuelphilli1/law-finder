  "summary": "In Hungarotex Foreign Trading Company for Textiles v. Emmanuel Ofori-Boateng, a Ghanaian businessman defaulted on a US$86,250 debt owed to a Hungarian corporation for goods supplied under a 1979 contract. After partial payments and failed installment agreements, court proceedings were initiated in 1984. The High Court entered a consent judgment requiring payment in cedis at the prevailing bank rate, later allowing installment payments. When the debtor paid only partially, a new consent judgment was agreed in 1985 for a fixed cedi amount. The debtor then sought to amend the 1984 judgment, arguing for an earlier exchange rate. The High Court accepted this, but the Court of Appeal reversed, allowing the appeal by majority. The key issue was whether Ghanaian courts could award judgments in foreign currency or convert debts using the exchange rate at the date of payment. The majority, citing changes in English law and Order 74 of the Civil Procedure Rules, held that conversion should occur at the date of payment to ensure fairness, especially under exchange controls. They emphasized that while English procedural rules may guide practice, substantive jurisdictional expansion is not permitted. The court also recognized its power under the Courts Act, 1971 (Act 372) to adopt equitable solutions from other legal systems. The dissent argued for adherence to prior precedent, but the majority favored a rational, justice-oriented approach over outdated authorities.",
