  "caseTitle": "THE SCOPE OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN GHANA [1993-95] VOL XIX RGL 84—",
  "summary": "This legal discourse by Hon. Justice J.N.K. Taylor explores the scope of human rights in Ghana, situating them within a hierarchy of normative frameworks: customary family units, community practices, municipal statutes, the Constitution, and international law. It emphasizes that human rights fundamentally belong to all individuals, including women, children, the sick, and the disabled, and are divided into civil and political rights exercised across economic, social, and cultural spheres. A key focus is the right to privacy, particularly in personal and reproductive decisions, which the state must protect even in the private domain. The work critiques persistent violations such as female genital mutilation and discriminatory practices in marriage, divorce, and property rights, especially against women. It traces the philosophical evolution of human rights from autocratic rule to democratic governance under the rule of law, underscoring the necessity for legal recognition and enforcement of these rights at all societal levels.",
