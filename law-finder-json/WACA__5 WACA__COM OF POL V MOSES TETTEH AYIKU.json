  "caseTitle": "COM OF POL V MOSES TETTEH AYIKU",
  "summary": "This 1939 West African Court of Appeal (WACA) decision in Accra addressed whether the trial judge acted within statutory authority under section 319(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Procedure Code when ordering a retrial. The appellant, Moses Tetteh Ayiku, challenged the procedural validity of the retrial order, arguing that the appellate court lacked power to order a fresh trial without first reversing the original finding and sentence. The court held that the term 'reverse' in the statute is broad and synonymous with 'set aside' or 'annul,' thereby affirming the Divisional Court's order for a new trial. The appeal was dismissed, and the retrial order upheld.",
