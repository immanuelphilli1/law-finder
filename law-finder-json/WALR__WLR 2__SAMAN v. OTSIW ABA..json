  "summary": "This 1957 Ghanaian Supreme Court decision addressed a land dispute originally filed in the Ajumako Native Court 'B' in December 1955. The court held that the Native Courts (Colony) (Reconstitution of Native Courts) (Variation) (No.4) Order, 1956, which took effect on April 30, 1956, removed the territorial jurisdiction of the Ajumako Native Court 'B' over the Brakwa and Odoben lands, including the land in dispute. Since the amending order lacked a saving clause for pending cases, the court ruled that the Ajumako Native Court 'B' lost jurisdiction over the matter as of that date. Consequently, all subsequent proceedings and the September 1956 judgment were declared null and void. The appeal was allowed, and the suit was struck out for lack of jurisdiction, with costs awarded to the defendant in the lower court.",
