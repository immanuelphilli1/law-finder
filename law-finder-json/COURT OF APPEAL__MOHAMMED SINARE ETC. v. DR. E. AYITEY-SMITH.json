  "summary": "This appeal arose from a land dispute in Accra where the Circuit Court entered judgment in favor of the defendant on his counterclaim after striking out the plaintiff's writ for failure to pay survey fees. The plaintiff died during proceedings, and his wife, Salma Sinare, was substituted as appellant. However, she was not properly served with hearing notices—service was erroneously effected on a non-existent co-defendant and later through her sister without legal basis. The Court of Appeal held that failure to serve the appellant with hearing notices in compliance with Order 9 and Order 10 of the High Court Rules, LN140A, rendered the proceedings a nullity. Additionally, the defendant improperly gave evidence twice without a court order for retrial. The appellate court found the trial judge lacked jurisdiction due to defective service and procedural irregularities. The judgment was set aside, and the counterclaim was ordered to be reheard de novo by a differently constituted Circuit Court.",
