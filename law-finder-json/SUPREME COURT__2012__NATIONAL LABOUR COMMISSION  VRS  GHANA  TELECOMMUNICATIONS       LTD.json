  "caseTitle": "NATIONAL LABOUR COMMISSION VRS GHANA TELECOMMUNICATIONS LTD",
  "summary": "The National Labour Commission (NLC) sought to enforce its order against Ghana Telecommunications Ltd, requiring the termination (not dismissal) of a former employee, Williams Hayford Appiah, with accrued benefits, after he misrepresented his academic credentials. Appiah had claimed attendance at Benkum Secondary School, but investigations revealed he obtained qualifications as a private candidate. He was dismissed for fraud under Regulation 144(iv) of the company’s Staff Rules. The NLC ruled the dismissal should be converted to termination under Regulation 206(b), but did not specify the accrued benefits. The High Court refused enforcement, finding the NLC had substituted charges and issued an incomplete order. The Court of Appeal affirmed. The Supreme Court upheld this, ruling that the NLC overstepped by changing the basis of the charge and that enforcement under s 172 of the Labour Act (Act 651) requires the order to be legally sound and complete. The Court also clarified that s 134, allowing appeals from NLC decisions, applies only to unfair labour practices under ss 127–131, not unfair termination under s 63. Thus, the company could challenge the order in enforcement proceedings.",
