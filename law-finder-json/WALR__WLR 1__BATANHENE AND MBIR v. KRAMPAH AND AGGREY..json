  "summary": "This 1956 West African Court of Appeal decision in *Batanhene and Mbir v. Krampah and Aggrey* concerned a malicious prosecution claim by plaintiffs who were chiefs acquitted of a native customary offence of insulting a paramount chief. The first defendant, the Omanhene, initiated prosecution after failing to attend a State Council meeting at a changed venue, despite having received notice through intermediaries. The court held that his failure to make reasonable inquiries negated any honest belief in the plaintiffs' guilt, establishing absence of reasonable and probable cause. His motive was deemed malicious due to his interest in preventing a destoolment inquiry. The second defendant, a police sergeant, was found equally liable for supporting the prosecution without independent investigation, thereby exercising discretionary authority with malice. The appeal was allowed, judgment entered for the plaintiffs, and damages remitted for determination.",
