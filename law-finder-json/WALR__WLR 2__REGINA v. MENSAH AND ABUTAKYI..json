  "summary": "In Regina v. Mensah and Abutakyi, the West African Court of Appeal overturned the summary convictions of two appellants for perjury under section 149(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code. The trial judge had summarily convicted them of perjury during a civil case concerning the sale of a motor vehicle, immediately after their testimony and before delivering judgment. The appellate court held that the judge had prejudged the issue by declaring his satisfaction of their perjury before allowing them to respond, thereby undermining the fairness of the proceedings. It emphasized that when using summary procedure for perjury, the specific points of conflicting evidence must be clearly brought to the accused's attention. The court also criticized the timing of the committal—occurring before judgment—and the judge’s expressed determination to make an example of perjurers, which created an appearance of bias. The appeals were allowed, and the committal orders were set aside.",
