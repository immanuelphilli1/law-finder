  "caseTitle": "OPANIN KWAME ATIA SETH ASANTE v NANA YAW BOAKYEM",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana reversed the Court of Appeal's decision and upheld the High Court's judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, Opain Kwame Atia and Seth Asante, declaring them and their siblings as rightful owners of a 70.91-acre land in Senchi, Akwamu Traditional Area. The plaintiffs' father, Opanin Kwame Amoaforo, had lawfully purchased the land in 1950 from Isaac Mensavi Dugbatey with approval from the Akwamu State Council and demarcation witnessed by the 1st Defendant (Chief/Mankrado of Senchi) and Opanin Dade Kofi. A Deed of Conveyance (Exhibit 'A') was executed, endorsed by the Omanhene, and registered in 1960 (Deeds Reg. No. 211/1960). After the father's death in 1962, his nephew Osei Kwaku managed the land and later formally transferred it to the plaintiffs and siblings through customary rites. The 1st Defendant unlawfully took possession after Osei Kwaku's death, cultivated the land, and later sold portions to the 2nd Defendant. The High Court found the plaintiffs' evidence credible and granted a declaration of title, perpetual injunction, and damages. The Court of Appeal reversed this, citing lack of capacity and failure to prove title. The Supreme Court reinstated the High Court's decision, holding that the trial judge's credibility assessments were sound and that Exhibit 'A' was valid despite the absence of stool occupant testimony, emphasizing that the appellate court erred in disregarding demeanor-based findings and improperly invalidating documentary evidence.",
