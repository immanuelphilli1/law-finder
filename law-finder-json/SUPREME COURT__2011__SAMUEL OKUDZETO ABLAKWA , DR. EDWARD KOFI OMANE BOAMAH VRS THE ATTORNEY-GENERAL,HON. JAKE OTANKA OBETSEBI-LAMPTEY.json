  "summary": "The case of Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa and Dr. Edward Kofi Omame Boamah v. The Attorney-General and Hon. Jake Otanka Obetsebi-Lamptey (WRITJ1/4/2010, 10th November 2011) involved a constitutional challenge to the purported sale of a government bungalow located at St. Mungo Street, Ridge, Accra, designated as Parcel No. 29, Block 12, Section 019. The plaintiffs sought declarations that the Minister for Water Resources, Works and Housing in the Kufuor government lacked constitutional authority under Articles 20(5), 23, 257, 258, 265, 284, and 296 of the 1992 Constitution to direct the sale or transfer of public land to the second defendant, a high-ranking public official, and that such action constituted cronyism, arbitrariness, and abuse of power. They also challenged the publication of a notice for land registration in the name of the second defendant as unconstitutional. The second defendant raised a preliminary objection, arguing the matter was essentially a land dispute within the jurisdiction of the High Court and that claims under Article 284 fell under CHRAJ’s jurisdiction. The Supreme Court rejected these objections, affirming its exclusive jurisdiction under Articles 2 and 130 to interpret and enforce constitutional provisions, particularly where public rights and constitutional breaches are alleged. The Court emphasized that the real issue was the constitutional validity of state actions concerning public land, not private land rights, and thus fell squarely within its purview. The ruling reaffirmed the principle that constitutional cases must be determined by the pith and substance of the claim, not by superficial categorization.",
