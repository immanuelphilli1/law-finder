  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision in Don Ackah v. Pergah Transport Limited & Ors. (2010) concerns a property dispute where the plaintiff claimed he purchased a house in the defendant's company name with an agreement for future transfer after securing a bank bid. The High Court initially ruled for the plaintiff, but the Court of Appeal reversed, ordering only repayment of GH\u000220,000 with interest. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal's decision, finding the plaintiff failed to discharge the burden of proof under Sections 10 and 11 of the Evidence Act, particularly by not calling Mr. Thompson, the bank's Managing Director, who was central to the alleged agreement. The court emphasized that an appeal is a re-hearing, allowing appellate courts to independently assess evidence, and held that the plaintiff's failure to corroborate his testimony with a material witness was fatal to his claim.",
