  "summary": "This 1935 West Africa Court of Appeal decision involved two sets of plaintiffs, E. Buhler & Company and J. F. Sicks & Co., appealing the refusal of a garnishee order against the Chief Registrar of Lagos. The funds in question were the remaining proceeds (�474 19s. 6d) from the sale of Caroline Johnson's mortgaged property at No. 10 Victoria Street, Lagos, after the first mortgagee (Bank of British West Africa) was paid. The appellants sought to garnish these funds to satisfy their judgment debts. The Court held that no garnishable debt existed because the remaining proceeds were properly allocated to the second mortgagee, Messrs. Coates & Co., under their court-ordered sale, and Caroline Johnson, the judgment debtor, had no beneficial interest in the funds until prior mortgage claims were satisfied. The Court rejected the argument that a judicial note constituted a valid payment-out order but affirmed the outcome, dismissing the appeal on the ground that there was no property in the hands of the Chief Registrar legally due to Caroline Johnson that could be garnished.",
