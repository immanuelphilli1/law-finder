  "caseTitle": "ANOTHER VERSUS MENSAH",
  "summary": "In this 1957 Ghanaian land dispute, the High Court allowed an appeal from a Native Court decision that dismissed a claim by the Paramount Chief (Omanhene) and an Odikro to recover possession of stool land. The Native Court had ruled the Paramount Chief lacked locus standi, asserting only the state council could sue on state land. Ollennu J. held that where a paramount stool creates a sub-stool and vests it with land, a residual interest remains in the paramount stool by native custom, supporting its standing to sue. The court affirmed that the occupant of the paramount stool, acting with the state council’s consent, is the proper person to litigate on behalf of the state. The decision clarified that statutory management controls over stool land do not divest traditional ownership or alter standing to sue, and emphasized that title remains with the stool. The appeal was allowed, and the case was ordered for rehearing.",
