  "caseTitle": "JOHN WILBERFORCE BAMIRO v S.C.O.A",
  "summary": "The appellant, John Wilberforce Bamiro, sued the respondent, S.C.O.A., for damages due to alleged injury to his house at 18 Kosoko Street, Lagos, caused by vibrations from the respondent's pile-driving operations during construction of an adjacent commercial building. The appellant claimed the respondent's agent had admitted liability and promised repairs. At trial, the appellant's expert witnesses attributed damage to vibration but provided no reasoning, while the respondent's expert concluded the damage was due to subsidence, not vibration, and supported this with analysis. The trial judge rejected the appellant's evidence and dismissed the claim. On appeal, the West Africa Court of Appeal upheld the decision, holding that the appellant failed to prove the damage was caused by the respondent's operations. The court found that the respondent's letter, while acknowledging some damage and promising repairs post-construction, did not constitute a binding admission of liability, especially where no actual damage was proven. The court emphasized that such admissions may be made under an erroneous belief of liability and must still be tested against evidence. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
