  "summary": "In this 1933 West African Court of Appeal case from the Gold Coast (modern-day Ghana), Addo Kofi appealed a decision by the Provincial Commissioner upholding a Native Tribunal's ruling that certain lands known as the Dove lands were pledged, not sold, by the plaintiff's ancestor to the defendant's ancestor in 1869 for 6s. 6d. The Tribunal ordered the land be returned upon repayment of that sum. The defendant argued the land was sold and that a prior 1927 judgment constituted res judicata or estoppel. The Court dismissed the appeal, affirming that under native customary law, a pledge does not expire with time and repayment entitles the pledgor to recovery. It held that concurrent factual findings by the Native Tribunal and Provincial Commissioner were valid and should not be overturned where supported by evidence. The 1927 judgment involved different parties and issues and thus did not create res judicata or estoppel. The Court also ruled that possession alone does not prove sale under customary law, and the absence of evidence on the price tradition (guaha or ntrimma) weakened the sale claim. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
