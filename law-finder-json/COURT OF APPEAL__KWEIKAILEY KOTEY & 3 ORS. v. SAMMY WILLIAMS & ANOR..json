  "caseTitle": "KWEIKAILEY KOTEY & 3 ORS. v. SAMMY WILLIAMS & ANOR.",
  "summary": "This interlocutory appeal before the Ghana Court of Appeal arose from a High Court order granting an interim injunction that restrained both parties from interfering with a disputed parcel of land (House No. D930/3, Thorpe and Club Roads, Accra). The defendants/appellants challenged the injunction, arguing that prior court decisions—including judgments from the Accra Central Local Court (1960), High Court (Ollenu, J., 1961), Court of Appeal (1969), and a Circuit Court ruling in their favor (2000)—had already established their lawful lease and possession, rendering the plaintiffs' suit an abuse of process. The plaintiffs/respondents claimed ownership through inheritance and argued that the 1977 lease to the defendants was invalid due to the lessor's lack of authority. They also contended that a compromise had nullified earlier judgments. The Court of Appeal scrutinized exhibits and prior rulings, noting that the compromise was not proven to predate the lease and thus could not bind the defendants. While expressing grave doubts about the plaintiffs' claim, the Court did not definitively rule on title but focused on the propriety of the injunction. It emphasized the principle from Venderpuye v. Nartey that interlocutory injunctions should preserve the status quo to prevent irreparable harm, provided the claim is not frivolous. The document appears to be truncated before the final disposition.",
