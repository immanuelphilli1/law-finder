  "caseTitle": "REGINA VERSUS ADJEI.",
  "summary": "In Regina v. Adjei, the Court of Appeal of Ghana upheld the appellant's murder conviction. The appellant had written a detailed confession in his own hand while in police custody, which was admitted into evidence despite the absence of an independent lay witness. The court held that while the presence of such a witness is a useful procedural safeguard to authenticate voluntariness, it is not a legal prerequisite for admissibility. The judge's decision to admit the confession was justified based on the appellant's own handwriting—careful and uniform—and corroborating police testimony. However, the court found that the trial judge erred by directing the assessors to disregard the confession if they thought it might not have been voluntary, as admissibility is a question solely for the judge. Despite this misdirection, the appeal was dismissed because the error was harmless given the strength of the evidence, including the appellant's implausible alibi and the circumstantial proof of guilt.",
