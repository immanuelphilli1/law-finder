  "caseTitle": "POLICE VERSUS OWUSU.",
  "summary": "The appellant, a police corporal, was convicted of extortion, a felony under the Criminal Code, in the Magistrate's Court at Saltpond. During the hearing, the magistrate proceeded in the appellant's absence while a prosecution witness testified, relying on s. 166(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. The Supreme Court of the Gold Coast held that while courts may proceed in the accused's absence for misdemeanours, doing so in a felony case constitutes a jurisdictional irregularity. Such a defect cannot be cured under s. 355 of the Code, which only applies to non-jurisdictional errors. Citing R. v. Sylvanus Samuels, the court ruled the conviction and sentence were void ab initio and quashed the conviction, discharging the appellant.",
