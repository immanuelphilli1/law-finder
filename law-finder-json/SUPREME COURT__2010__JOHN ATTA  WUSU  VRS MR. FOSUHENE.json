  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana judgment addresses whether a plaintiff's initiation of a second civil action on the same land dispute constitutes an abuse of court process after discontinuing a prior suit with liberty, despite a pending counterclaim by the defendant. The plaintiff first sued in 2002 for declarations of allotment, damages for trespass, and injunction, but later discontinued with court leave. The defendant's counterclaim remained pending. In 2003, the plaintiff filed a new action with substantially similar reliefs. The defendant moved to dismiss, arguing abuse of process. The High Court agreed and struck out the writ. The Court of Appeal reversed, holding that discontinuance with liberty permits a fresh action. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal, affirming that Order 26 Rule 1 of the High Court Rules (LN 540) allows a plaintiff to bring a new suit after discontinuance with liberty, and such discontinuance does not operate as estoppel. The Court rejected the argument that a pending counterclaim bars a fresh action, emphasizing that the correct legal question was the effect of 'discontinuance with liberty,' which the Court of Appeal properly answered.",
