  "caseTitle": "REX v TAIRU IBARIBA",
  "summary": "The case involves an appeal against the conviction of three individuals—Tairu Ibariba, Imoru Ibariba, and Amodu Pashi—for murder committed during an armed raid on the deceased's house. The prosecution relied partly on statements made by the deceased identifying the appellants as his assailants, one made at Apena and another in hospital. The appellate court ruled that the statements were inadmissible as hearsay, not falling within any exception to the hearsay rule, particularly because they were not part of the res gestae and the accused did not clearly admit their truth. Although one accused partially responded, the court found the evidentiary value negligible. The court held that the trial judge misdirected himself by relying on these statements, and given the weakness of the remaining evidence, it could not be said that the verdict would have been the same without the inadmissible evidence. Consequently, the convictions were quashed and acquittals entered.",
