  "summary": "In this Ghanaian Court of Appeal case, the plaintiff and first defendant were adjoining landowners whose boundary dispute was referred to customary arbitration before a local chief and elders. Both parties presented their cases, agreed to a site visit, paid 25s. each as a sign of consent, and witnessed the physical demarcation of the boundary. The first defendant later refused to attend the formal pronouncement and demanded a refund, leading to no oral declaration of the award. The plaintiff sought enforcement of the demarcation as a binding award. The Court held that a formal pronouncement was not necessary, as the physical demarcation constituted sufficient publication of the award under customary law. The court emphasized that once parties voluntarily submit to arbitration—evidenced by conduct such as payment and participation—they cannot resile. The appeal was allowed, the Land Court’s decision reversed, and judgment entered in favor of the plaintiff confirming the demarcated boundary.",
