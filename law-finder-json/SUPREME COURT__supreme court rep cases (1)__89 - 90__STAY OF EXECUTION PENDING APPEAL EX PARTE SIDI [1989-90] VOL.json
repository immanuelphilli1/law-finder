  "caseTitle": "STAY OF EXECUTION PENDING APPEAL EX PARTE SIDI [1989-90] VOL",
  "summary": "In Republic v Court of Appeal, Accra: Ex parte Sidi, a landmark Ghanaian Supreme Court decision, the court addressed the issue of whether onerous terms imposed on a stay of execution pending appeal could be equated with a refusal, thereby permitting the applicant to reapply at the Court of Appeal under Rule 28 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The case arose after the High Court ordered the judgment-debtor to pay the full judgment debt into court as a condition for stay, which the debtor claimed was inconvenient and tantamount to a refusal. The Supreme Court considered longstanding principles balancing the rights of judgment-creditors to enjoy their judgment and judgment-debtors to pursue effective appeals. It examined prior authorities like Saunders v Awudu and Joseph v Jebeile, where stringent payment-into-court conditions were upheld without constituting refusals. The court ultimately rejected the notion that financial inconvenience equates to denial of relief, affirming that a conditional grant remains a grant and does not trigger the right to reapply at a higher court. This decision reinforced judicial discretion in crafting equitable stay conditions while curbing procedural abuse.",
