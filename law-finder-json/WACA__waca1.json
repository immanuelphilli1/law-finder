  "summary": "The document titled 'TABLE OF CASES' from the West African Court of Appeal (WACA) appears to be an index or listing of cases heard by the court, likely used as a reference tool within a legal library or research database. It contains a list of case names involving parties from Ghana and other parts of West Africa, many of which involve customary law issues, land disputes, and appeals from lower courts. However, no substantive details such as facts, legal arguments, judicial reasoning, or outcomes are provided in this excerpt. The source is attributed to 'GHANA LAW FINDER', a self-help legal resource compiled by Tony Kaddy. As such, this document serves as a navigational aid rather than a full legal judgment.",
