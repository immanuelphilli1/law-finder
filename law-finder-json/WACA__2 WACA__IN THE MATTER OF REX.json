  "caseTitle": "MATTER OF REX VERSUS THEOPHILUS ADENUGA TUNW",
  "summary": "This 1935 West African Court of Appeal decision, delivered by Acting Chief Justice Cor. Butler-Lloyd, addressed an application for bail pending appeal by Theophilus Adenuga Tunw Ashe, the former Awujale of Ijebu Ode, who had been convicted and sentenced to four years' imprisonment on multiple counts under the Criminal Code. The application was made under Section 17(2) of the West African Court of Appeal Ordinance (No. 47 of 1933). The court denied bail, emphasizing that bail pending appeal is only granted in exceptional circumstances or where undue delay in hearing the appeal would result in a substantial portion of the sentence being served. The court found that a two-month delay relative to a four-year sentence did not meet this threshold. Reference was made to prior cases, including Rex v Lawrence and Rex v Riegels, to illustrate distinguishing factors such as legal uncertainty or the need for client-counsel communication, which were absent here. The ruling reaffirmed judicial restraint in bail decisions to maintain consistency in future cases.",
