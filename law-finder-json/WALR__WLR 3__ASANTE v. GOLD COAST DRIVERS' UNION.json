  "caseTitle": "ASANTE VERSUS GOLD COAST DRIVERS'",
  "summary": "This case involved an appeal from a Magistrate's Court decision that reversed a Native Court judgment in a claim for damages for breach of an alleged tenancy agreement. The plaintiff sought to enforce an oral agreement to let three rooms at a fixed monthly rent against the Gold Coast Drivers' Union, an unincorporated association sued by its business name. The High Court held that the Native Court lacked jurisdiction for two reasons: first, tenancy agreements for houses or rooms are not recognized under native customary law and thus fall under English law pursuant to the proviso to section 15(b) of the Native Courts (Southern Ghana) Ordinance, 1951; second, an unincorporated association sued by its business name does not qualify as a 'person or class of persons' under section 10 of the Ordinance. The court relied on authoritative sources including Sarbah’s Fanti Customary Law and prior decisions such as Bey v. Abadoo and Vanderpuye v. Plange to confirm that leasing of rooms is a transaction introduced by European influence and unknown to native custom. Consequently, the appeal was allowed, and the Native Court's jurisdiction was found to be ousted.",
