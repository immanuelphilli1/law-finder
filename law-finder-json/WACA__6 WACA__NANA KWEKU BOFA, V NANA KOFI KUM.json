  "caseTitle": "NANA KWEKU BOFA, V NANA KOFI KUM",
  "summary": "This 1940 decision of the West Africa Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The appellant, Nana Kofi Kum, Ohene of Korase, sought to appeal a decision from the Chief Commissioner of Ashanti's Court but could not point to any statutory provision granting the Court of Appeal jurisdiction. Relying on section 8 of the West African Court of Appeal Ordinance (Cap. 5), which allows the court to entertain appeals 'on any terms which it thinks just,' the court held that this provision does not confer general appellate jurisdiction but is limited to cases where an appeal already lies under other statutory provisions. The court affirmed the preliminary objection, citing the unreported 1932 decision in Dovlo Kudiabor v. Hutohoke Kudanu, and dismissed the appeal with costs of £28 11s. 6d.",
