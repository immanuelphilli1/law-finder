  "caseTitle": "ABUAKWA STOOL AND ANOTHER VERSUS ADANSI STOOL AND ANOTHER",
  "summary": "The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council dismissed an appeal by the Akyem Abuakwa Stool and its subordinate, Muronam, seeking a declaration of title to land also claimed by the Adansi Stool and its subordinate, Banka. The land had previously been the subject of litigation in 1940 between Muronam and Banka, where Muronam failed to establish title. Although Akyem Abuakwa was not a formal party in that case, it was aware of the proceedings and supported Muronam. The courts below held that Akyem Abuakwa was estopped from re-litigating the issue either by res judicata (as a privy) or by conduct (for standing by without intervening). The Privy Council upheld this, emphasizing that where a person with an interest allows another to litigate on their behalf in the same cause, they are bound by the result. The principle, rooted in equity, justice, and common sense, was deemed applicable in African customary contexts even if historically limited in English law. The appeal was dismissed, affirming that the prior judgment barred the current claim.",
