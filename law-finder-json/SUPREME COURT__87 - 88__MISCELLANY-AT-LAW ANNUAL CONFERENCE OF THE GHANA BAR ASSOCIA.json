  "summary": "The document is not a judicial decision but a report on the 1988 Annual Conference of the Ghana Bar Association held in Sekondi-Takoradi. It includes the full text of the controversial opening address by Mr. Peter Ala Adjetey, National President of the Ghana Bar Association, in which he criticized corruption among a minority of judges and magistrates, calling for an end to bribery in judicial rulings. He highlighted systemic issues including the absence of a judicial council, inadequate judicial remuneration, poor prison conditions, and the need for a national parole board. Adjetey also discussed challenges facing the legal profession, such as low membership subscriptions and the launch of the Ghana Bar Bulletin. The report further notes discussions with government officials, including the Attorney-General and the Acting Director of Prisons, and outlines plans for future legal reform and professional development activities. The event featured speeches by Mr. Justice J.N.K. Taylor (deputising for the Chief Justice) and Mr. Alao Aka-Bashorun, President of the Nigerian Bar Association.",
