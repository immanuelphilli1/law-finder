  "caseTitle": "THE GOLD COAST AND ASHANTI ELECTRIC POWER",
  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal allowed an appeal by The Gold Coast and Ashanti Electric Power Development Corporation Ltd. against the Attorney-General, reversing a lower court's dismissal of the suit. The trial judge had dismissed the case on the grounds that the plaintiffs' pleadings disclosed no legal cause of action, relying on facts not admitted in the pleadings—specifically, whether the plaintiff objected to a licence within the statutory period and whether it was incorporated at the relevant time. The appellate court held that the joinder of issue in the plaintiff's reply denied all material facts in the defence unless expressly admitted, rendering those facts disputed. It further ruled that the trial judge erred in applying the Rules of the Supreme Court of England after a statement of defence was filed, as local rules under the Courts Ordinance (particularly Order 19 and Order 32, Rule 2) provided sufficient procedural mechanisms. The appeal was allowed, costs awarded, and the case remitted for trial.",
