  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case, Nova Complex Limited v Ghana Port & Harbours Authority, centered on the correct rate of post-judgment interest applicable to a debt. The Supreme Court had previously awarded judgment on 15th November 2006, and the dispute arose over whether post-judgment interest should be calculated under the older 4% rate (Order 42 r15, LN 140A) or the newer Court (Award of Interest and Post-Judgment Interest) Rules, 2005 (CI 52). The appellant argued that applying CI 52 retroactively from the 2004 High Court judgment was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court unanimously rejected this, holding that CI 52 applied prospectively from its own 2006 final judgment, not retroactively from 2004. It affirmed that the final appellate judgment is the operative date for post-judgment interest under CI 52. The Court also upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision that post-judgment interest on the US dollar component should accrue at the prevailing U.S. rate until final payment, rejecting the use of the Bank of Ghana's rate. The appeal was dismissed.",
