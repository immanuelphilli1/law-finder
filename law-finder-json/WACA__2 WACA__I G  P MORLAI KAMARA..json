  "caseTitle": "INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF POLICE. VERSUS MORLAI KAMARA.",
  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal held that section 11 of the English Summary Jurisdiction Act of 1848, which imposes a six-month time limit for prosecuting petty offenses, does not apply in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). The court reasoned that the colonial legislature had enacted local ordinances—such as the Supreme Court Ordinance, Criminal Procedure Ordinance, and Commissioners Ordinance—that comprehensively governed criminal procedure, effectively replacing the English statute. The omission of the six-month time limit in these local laws indicated a deliberate legislative decision that it was unsuitable for local conditions. Furthermore, section 15 of the Supreme Court Ordinance specified that procedural matters must be governed solely by local laws or court rules, excluding the application of external statutes. Therefore, the Court concluded that criminal procedure in Police Magistrates' and District Commissioners' Courts was regulated entirely by local law, and there was no basis to invoke English statutes of general application.",

    "English statutes of general application do not apply where local laws provide comprehensive regulation.",
    "The court emphasizes autonomy of colonial legal procedure from English statutory frameworks."

  "confidenceNotes": "The decision is clearly grounded in statutory interpretation of colonial-era ordinances and the inapplicability of English statutes to local courts.",
