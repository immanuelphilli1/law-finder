  "caseTitle": "BOAKYE VERSUS BAABU",
  "summary": "In Boakye v. Baabu, the plaintiff sought a declaration of title to land, which the defendant claimed was previously granted to her. The trial Native Court found in favor of the defendant, crediting her testimony over the plaintiff's due to its consistency and corroboration. On appeal, the Native Appeal Court reversed the decision after visiting the locus in quo, despite not having observed the witnesses. The West African Court of Appeal held that such site visits cannot justify overturning factual findings made by a trial court that assessed witness credibility firsthand. It emphasized that appellate courts, especially native ones, must not substitute their own impressions from a site visit for the trial court's evaluation of live testimony. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the principle that findings of fact based on witness demeanor should be respected unless clearly erroneous.",
