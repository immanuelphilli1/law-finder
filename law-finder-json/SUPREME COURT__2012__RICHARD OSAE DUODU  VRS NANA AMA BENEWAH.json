  "caseTitle": "RICHARD OSAE DUODU VRS NANA AMA BENEWAH",
  "summary": "This is a civil land dispute appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana, where Richard Osae Duodu (plaintiff/appellant) challenged the Court of Appeal's reversal of the High Court’s judgment in his favor. The dispute centered on ownership of a parcel of land in Accra, with both parties claiming title through separate purchases from the Reindorf family. The defendant, Nana Ama Benewah, alleged that the plaintiff’s grantor forged the signature of Carl Reindorf, the family representative, in the deed of assignment (Exhibit A). A forensic expert confirmed the forgery, and the Court of Appeal found the plaintiff’s title tainted by fraud. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision, ruling that the plaintiff failed to discharge the burden of proving he was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice, especially given the clear evidence of fraud that a diligent buyer should have detected. The appeal was dismissed, and the defendant’s claim to title was affirmed.",
