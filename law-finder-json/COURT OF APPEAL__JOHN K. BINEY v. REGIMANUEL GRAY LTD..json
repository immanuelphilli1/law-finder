  "caseTitle": "K. BINEY v. REGIMANUEL GRAY LTD. CIVIL APPEAL NO.",
  "summary": "This Court of Appeal decision in Ghana concerns a civil appeal (No. 31/2002) by Regimanuel Gray Ltd. against a High Court order granting summary judgment to John K. Biney for a refund of part payment for a house purchase. The plaintiff sought US$41,409.50, interest, damages, and costs after terminating the contract due to inability to pay. The High Court granted summary judgment, finding no triable issues. The Court of Appeal, however, held that the defendant had raised legitimate triable issues—including currency of payment, breach of contract, and financial losses—warranting a full trial. The appeal was allowed, the summary judgment set aside, and the case remitted for trial with directions to allow the defendant to defend. Costs on appeal were awarded to the defendant, while costs in the lower court were to abide the result of the rehearing.",
