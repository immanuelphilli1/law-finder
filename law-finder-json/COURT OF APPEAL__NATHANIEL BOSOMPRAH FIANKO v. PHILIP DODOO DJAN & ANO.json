  "caseTitle": "NATHANIEL BOSOMPRAH FIANKO v. PHILIP DODOO DJAN & ANO.",
  "summary": "This Court of Appeal decision in Ghana concerns a civil dispute over ownership of a property between the appellant, Nathaniel Bosomprah Fianko, and the respondents, Philip Dodoo Djan and another. The appellant relied on documentary evidence, including a title deed, building permit, and rate receipts in his deceased father's name, to claim ownership. The respondents argued that the father was only a bare legal owner, with beneficial ownership belonging to the co-respondent, who funded the property. The court upheld the High Court's dismissal of the appellant's claim, emphasizing that the father's and his children's conduct—regularly handing over rental income to the co-respondent—constituted a declaration against interest and established estoppel by conduct under section 26 of the Evidence Decree, NRCD 175. The court rejected the argument that the co-respondent, as a mere witness to the deed, was estopped under section 25, clarifying that a witness is not a party to the instrument. The appellate court found no misappreciation of evidence and affirmed that concurrent factual findings by lower courts should not be disturbed absent a clear error. The appeal was dismissed.",
