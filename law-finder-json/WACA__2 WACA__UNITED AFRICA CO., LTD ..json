  "caseTitle": "UNITED AFRICA CO., LTD .",
  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal allowed an appeal by United Africa Co., Ltd. against a non-suit granted in the lower court due to non-prosecution of the defendant for alleged felony. The lower court had dismissed the claim for damages of \u00027,816 for breach of contract, treating the negligence claim as a disguised felony. The appellate court held that the plaintiff had a reasonable excuse for non-prosecution, as the police and law officers had investigated and declined to prosecute. It emphasized that there is no duty on a private party to initiate a private prosecution after state authorities refuse. The court found the evidence of breach overwhelming and reinstated judgment for the plaintiff, stressing the duty of courts to ensure real justice by allowing all material evidence.",
