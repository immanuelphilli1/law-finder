  "caseTitle": "COMMISSIONER OF POLICE VERSUS BANDAILY",
  "summary": "The appellant, Bandaily, was convicted by a Magistrate under section 418 of the Criminal Code for accepting £50 under the pretence of influencing a public officer, District Magistrate Bruce Lyle. The prosecution's evidence, which was accepted by the trial court, clearly indicated that the appellant demanded the money not for his own benefit but to pass on to the Magistrate, with an additional £10 loaned by the appellant to make up the required sum. On appeal, Ollennu J. held that section 418 requires the accused to accept valuable consideration for themselves, as the provision lacks the phrase 'for himself or for any other person' found in related offences like corruption and extortion. The court emphasized the principle of strict construction of penal statutes, ruling that the legislature's omission of such language was intentional. The trial magistrate's interpretation—that the accused must have intended to keep the money—was a misdirection, as it substituted the charge with one of false pretences. Consequently, the conviction was quashed, and the appellant was acquitted and discharged.",
