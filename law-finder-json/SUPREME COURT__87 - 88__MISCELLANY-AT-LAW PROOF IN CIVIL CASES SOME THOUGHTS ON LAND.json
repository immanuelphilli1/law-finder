  "caseTitle": "MISCELLANY-AT-LAW PROOF IN CIVIL CASES SOME THOUGHTS ON LAND",
  "summary": "This legal commentary by Justice Amua-Sekyi of the Ghanaian Supreme Court examines the standard of proof in civil land cases, particularly actions for declaration of title. While civil cases generally require proof on a balance of probabilities, the author argues that Ghanaian courts demand a higher standard—akin to proof beyond reasonable doubt—for title declarations. The plaintiff must rely on the strength of their own case, not the weakness of the defendant's. Key cases like J M Kodilinye v Mbanefo Odu establish this principle. However, three qualifications exist: (1) if land boundaries are unclear, the plaintiff may be non-suited; (2) long, exclusive, and quiet possession creates a prima facie title, shifting the burden to the defendant; and (3) if title is unproven but possession is established, courts may grant a right of occupancy instead of dismissing the claim. The article draws on West African Court of Appeal, Privy Council, and Ghanaian case law to clarify evidentiary standards in land disputes.",
