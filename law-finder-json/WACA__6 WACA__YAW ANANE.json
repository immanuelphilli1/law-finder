  "summary": "This 1940 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in *Omanhene Nkyi Ababio v. Kw Am In Ackumpong* addressed jurisdictional and procedural issues arising from a land dispute transferred from a Native Tribunal of the State Council to the Divisional Court. The Court held that while the State Council lacked jurisdiction under Section 48 of the Native Administration Ordinance, the Provincial Commissioner had authority under Section 75 to transfer the case to the Divisional Court. The Divisional Court, possessing jurisdiction under Section 14 of the Courts Ordinance but initially barred from exercising it by Section 17, could validly proceed after the transfer. The appeal was dismissed with directions to give full effect to Schedule III Order 26 of the Courts Ordinance, allowing necessary amendments to pleadings even if altering the capacity in which parties sue. The Court overruled the obiter dictum in *Malm v. Wulff* that restricted such amendments, affirming the Divisional Court's duty to ensure the real issues between parties are properly before it.",
