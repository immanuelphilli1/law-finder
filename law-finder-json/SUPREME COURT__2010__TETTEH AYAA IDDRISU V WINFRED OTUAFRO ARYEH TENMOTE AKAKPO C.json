  "summary": "This is a civil appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana concerning a land dispute between Tetteh Ayaa Iddrisu (Respondent) and Winfred Otuafro Aryeh and Tenmote Akakpo (Appellants). The core issue was the enforceability of an agreement dated 29th September 1993 (Exhibit C), under which the Appellants allegedly agreed to pay rent for using the Respondent's land. The High Court and Court of Appeal upheld the agreement, ordering enforcement and a survey to determine encroached plots. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, affirming that the Appellants failed to prove economic duress, as they did not show catastrophic consequences or take steps to void the agreement. The claim of forgery regarding the Respondent's title deed (Exhibit 1) was rejected for lack of pleading in the trial court, making the evidence inadmissible. The Court also held that the Appellants could not claim ownership merely due to the Respondent's evidentiary weakness, emphasizing that a counterclaim must be proven on its own merits. The appeal, based solely on the omnibus ground that the judgment was against the weight of evidence, failed due to insufficient factual and legal support.",
