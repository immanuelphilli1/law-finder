  "caseTitle": "FRABINA LIMITED, SHELL SERVICE STATION VRS SHELL GHANA LIMI",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision from 2010 concerns a civil appeal in the case of Frabina Limited v. Shell Ghana Limited, where the appellant sought recovery of GHS 10,000 paid as 'working capital' under a dealership agreement, claiming it was a refundable security deposit. The court rejected this argument, noting that throughout prior proceedings, the appellant consistently referred to the amount as working capital, thereby estopping a change in position at the appellate level. The court emphasized the importance of pleadings and the principle that new legal arguments not raised in lower courts cannot be introduced at the Supreme Court level absent exceptional circumstances. The appeal was dismissed, upholding the lower courts' concurrent findings.",
