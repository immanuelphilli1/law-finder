  "caseTitle": "SEMINAR ON THE TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS TYPES OF PUNISHMENT [2",
  "summary": "This academic paper by Senah K.A., a lecturer in Sociology at the University of Ghana, provides a historical and comparative analysis of punishment systems across societies, from early tribal communities to modern states. It explores how punishment has evolved from forms rooted in collective responsibility, religious taboos, and physical retribution—such as execution for incest or witchcraft, blood feuds, and mutilation under lex talionis—to institutionalized methods like imprisonment, probation, and fines. The author highlights the persistence of brutal practices in early modern societies, including flogging, branding, stocks, and cruel execution methods. While noting that contemporary penology espouses humanistic goals of reform and rehabilitation, the paper critiques the ongoing inhumane conditions in many prisons, including in Ghana, where inmates suffer severe deprivation. The work concludes by advocating for a shift from punitive models to rehabilitative justice.",
