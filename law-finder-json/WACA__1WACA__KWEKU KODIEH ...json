  "summary": "This 1930 West African Court of Appeal decision involved an application for conditional leave to appeal to the Privy Council. The judgment awarded the plaintiffs-respondents a sum of £491 5s. 6d., which included interest. The appellant sought to include costs to exceed the £500 threshold required for appeal, but the court held that where an appeal is limited by the value of the matter in dispute, costs cannot be counted toward meeting the minimum amount. The court dismissed the application with costs, following precedents such as Doorga Chowdry v. Ramanauth Chowdry and Great Western Ry. of Canada v. Braid.",
