  "caseTitle": "WILSON KOFI KUTSOKEY v. E. SOWA NARTEY, MR. TAGOE &",
  "summary": "This appeal arose from a conflict between two orders issued by coordinate courts in Ghana. Samuel Tandoh, the appellant and highest bidder at a court-ordered public auction of a property belonging to Edmund Kwami Kutsokey, was lawfully granted possession of the property by Circuit Court Judge Kwadwo Owusu on July 9, 2003, and was put into physical possession on August 7, 2003. Subsequently, Wilson Kofi Kutsokey, the plaintiff and relative of the judgment debtor, filed a separate suit challenging the auction and obtained an interim injunction from Circuit Court Judge Anthony Oppong on September 9, 2003, restraining Tandoh from ejecting him. Tandoh moved to vacate the injunction, arguing it contravened the prior possession order. The motion was denied on October 22, 2003. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the injunction was improperly granted in the face of a valid, subsisting order from a coordinate court. The lower court judge admitted being misled by the non-disclosure of the prior order. The Court ruled that such an injunction constituted an abuse of process and undermined judicial coherence. Consequently, the appeal was allowed, the ruling refusing to vacate the injunction was quashed, and the interim injunction was vacated.",
