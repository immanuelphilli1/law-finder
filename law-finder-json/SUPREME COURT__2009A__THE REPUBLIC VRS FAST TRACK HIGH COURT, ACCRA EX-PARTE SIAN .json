  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC VRS FAST TRACK HIGH COURT, ACCRA EX-PARTE SIAN",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana ruling addressed an application by Sian Goldfields Limited seeking to quash a judgment from the Fast Track High Court, Accra, delivered in favor of Aurex Management and Investment AG/SA Ltd. The core issue stemmed from a prior Court of Appeal decision that nullified an earlier suit due to a defective power of attorney. The applicant argued that the High Court judge violated audi alteram partem, lacked jurisdiction, and improperly proceeded despite a pending stay application at the Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court dismissed the application, holding that the power of attorney in the fresh suit (AC 158/2007) was distinct from the one previously invalidated, thus the trial judge did not overrule the Court of Appeal. It affirmed that declaring proceedings a nullity does not void the writ itself unless jurisdiction is the issue, and that the trial judge’s jurisdiction remained intact as the stay application was not properly brought to the court's attention. The Court emphasized that errors in following precedent are appealable, not grounds for certiorari.",
