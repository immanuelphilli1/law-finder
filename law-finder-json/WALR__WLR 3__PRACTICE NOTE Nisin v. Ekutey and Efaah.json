  "caseTitle": "PRACTICE NOTE Nisin v. Ekutey and Efaah",
  "summary": "In this practice note from the High Court of Ghana, Adumua-Bossman J. addressed the procedural requirements for granting leave to serve a writ outside the jurisdiction under the Civil Procedure Rules, 1954, specifically Ord. 2, r. 4, and Ord. 11, r. 1. The court emphasized that while it does not delve into the full merits of a plaintiff's claim at this stage, it must be satisfied that the plaintiff has a probable cause of action. Relying on the precedent of Societe Generale de Paris v. Dreyfus (1885), the court held that if no cause of action is disclosed, leave to serve the writ outside the jurisdiction should not be granted. This decision underscores the threshold requirement for jurisdictional extensions in civil proceedings.",
