  "caseTitle": "KWASI SAFO v CHIEF KOFI YENSU. AND OTHERS",
  "summary": "This 1941 West Africa Court of Appeal case involved an interpleader suit by the Techiman Stool, claiming ownership of land attached in execution by judgment-creditor Kwasi Safo following a debt default by the Offuman Stool. The Techiman Stool argued that the land fell within its administrative boundaries and that prior decisions vested title in them. The trial judge held the land belonged exclusively to the Offuman Stool, a finding upheld on appeal. The appellate court ruled that administrative boundaries do not determine land ownership, that the Offumans' temporary service under the Techimanhene did not transfer title, and that the matter was not res judicata. It affirmed the Committee of Privileges' authority in land disputes and found ample evidence supporting the Offuman Stool's traditional ownership. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
