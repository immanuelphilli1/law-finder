  "caseTitle": "DANIEL SACKEY QUARCOOPOME v SANYO ELECTRIC TRADING & ANOR",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana considered an appeal in Daniel Sackey Quarcoopome v. Sanyo Electric Trading & Anor. (2008), where the plaintiff, who served as a board director from 1974 to 2001, claimed remuneration for services rendered. The High Court had awarded GHS 350 million on a quantum meruit basis after finding the oral contract terms too vague for enforcement. The Court of Appeal overturned this, citing a conflict with Section 194 of the Companies Code, Act 179 (1963), which governs director remuneration. The Supreme Court examined whether the plaintiff was duly appointed under the Companies Code, noting deficiencies in written consent and regulatory compliance. Despite long service, the Court found he was not properly appointed. It held that quantum meruit could apply where no valid contract exists, but emphasized that courts must not usurp shareholders' statutory authority over remuneration. The appeal was dismissed, affirming that equitable remedies cannot override statutory corporate governance structures.",
