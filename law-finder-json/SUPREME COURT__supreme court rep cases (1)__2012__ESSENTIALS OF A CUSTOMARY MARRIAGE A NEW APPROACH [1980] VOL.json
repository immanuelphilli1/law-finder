  "summary": "This legal analysis challenges the traditional judicial approach to determining the validity of customary marriages in Ghana, arguing that courts have incorrectly elevated procedural elements—such as family consent, the giving of 'drinks' (dowry), and formal ceremonies—into rigid legal essentials. Drawing on case law, anthropological research, and social observation, the author asserts that a customary marriage is fundamentally based on the voluntary agreement of the couple to live together as husband and wife, evidenced by cohabitation. The article critiques the over-reliance on formalities derived from outdated scholarly descriptions and colonial-era interpretations, emphasizing that contemporary social practice often involves couples self-identifying as married without fulfilling all traditional steps. It calls for a more flexible, evidence-based approach that considers the totality of circumstances rather than fixed requirements.",
