  "summary": "In Denico Engineering Ltd. v. Big Aido Construction Ltd., the Court of Appeal reviewed the trial judge's award of ₵20,000,000 in general and special damages, finding that only the special damages based on the hire agreement (Exhibit ‘B’) were justified. The court held that the hire rate of ₵40,000 per day constituted liquidated damages, and calculated the rightful award for the period from February to May 1988 as ₵4,320,000, adding to the previously accepted ₵7,127,000 for June–December 1988, totaling ₵11,457,000. The court set aside the general damages due to lack of evidentiary basis and awarded interest on the outstanding amount under LI 1295, recognizing the plaintiff’s right to the use of money wrongfully withheld.",
