  "caseTitle": "JUDGM THE 29THJULY, 1936.",
  "summary": "This case involved a dispute over the alleged 1920 sale of the Kyeramase-Kohye lands, traditionally attached to the Akroso Stool but subject to reversion to the paramount Mansu Stool. The Ohene of Mansu (respondent) denied consenting to the sale to C. M. Appeatu, W. E. Appeatu, and Yaw Mensah. The West African Court of Appeal restored the Superior Native Tribunal's judgment in favor of the respondent, which held the sale invalid due to lack of consent from the Mansu Stool. The Privy Council dismissed the appeal, affirming that the sale was not binding on the Mansu Stool. Although the Guaha ceremony was performed by Kwame Amanano (the chief's brother), he lacked authority from the Mansu Stool. The appellants failed to produce any receipt or conveyance, paid no money to the Mansu Stool, and were found to have submitted a forged receipt in prior litigation. The Privy Council varied the order to avoid binding non-parties but upheld the core finding of invalidity.",
