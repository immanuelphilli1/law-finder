  "caseTitle": "REX v GEORGE KITOYE ROBERTS",
  "summary": "The appellant, George Kitoye Roberts, was convicted on three counts of theft by the Supreme Court of the Gambia, each carrying a sentence of fifteen months' hard labour, to run concurrently, and compensation ordered under the first count. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that the three charges were alternative counts arising from the same offence, and thus only one conviction could stand. The convictions on the second and third counts were quashed, while the first was upheld. The sentence was reduced from fifteen to nine months' hard labour due to restitution by the appellant and the trial court's erroneous assumption of multiple offences. The compensation order of £15 14s. to Mrs. Eliza Andrews remained in effect.",
