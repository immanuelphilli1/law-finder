  "caseTitle": "WELFORD QUARCOO VRS THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL, THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION",
  "summary": "In Welford Quarcoo v. The Attorney-General & The Electoral Commission (2012), the plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of several provisions of the Local Government Act, 1993 (Act 462), particularly those empowering the President to create districts and municipalities by executive instrument and to direct the Electoral Commission. The plaintiff argued that such powers violated Articles 241(2), 106(1), and 45 of the 1992 Constitution by undermining parliamentary sovereignty and public participation. The Supreme Court dismissed the suit, relying on its contemporaneous decision in Naakarley Amegatcher v. Attorney-General, which upheld the constitutionality of the same provisions, affirming that legislative delegation to the executive in this context was lawful.",
