  "summary": "This 1940 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Accra, Ghana, involved an appeal by headmen and representatives of Winneba fishermen seeking to prevent the execution of a writ of Fi. Fa. on community canoes. The plaintiffs argued they were not judgment debtors in the underlying suit and thus不应 be subject to seizure. The lower court had refused an interim injunction, ruling that interpleader proceedings after seizure were the only remedy. The appellate court reversed, holding that statutory interpleader rules only apply post-seizure and do not bar pre-emptive applications to restrain unlawful execution. Citing Halsbury’s Laws, the court affirmed the right to seek injunctive relief against imminent, unlawful interference with property rights. The appeal was allowed, the lower court’s decision set aside, and the case remanded for hearing on the injunction application, with costs awarded to the appellants.",
