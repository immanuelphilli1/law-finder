  "summary": "In Rex v Benedict Eyaboro Khama, the West African Court of Appeal reviewed convictions of four appellants charged with cheating under s 421, stealing under s 390, and possession of stolen goods under s 430 of the Criminal Code. The court found that the evidence supported a false pretence under s 418 and conviction under s 419, but not a fraudulent trick under s 421. It held that the trial judge erred in convicting under s 421 but could have, and should have, convicted under s 419 as an alternative to the stealing charge, which was wrongly dismissed for duplicity. Under s 11(2) of the West African Court of Appeal Ordinance, the court substituted the verdicts for the first and third accused to guilty under s 419 and sentenced them to 18 months and 2 years' imprisonment with hard labour, respectively. Their convictions under s 430 were quashed, as one cannot be separately convicted for possessing money obtained by the same fraudulent act. The appeals of the second and fourth accused against their s 430 convictions were dismissed due to sufficient supporting evidence. The appellants' request to adduce further evidence on appeal was denied.",
