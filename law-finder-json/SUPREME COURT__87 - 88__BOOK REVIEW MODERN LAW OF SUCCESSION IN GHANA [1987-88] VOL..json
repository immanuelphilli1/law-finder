  "summary": "This 1987–88 book review published in the Review of Ghana Law evaluates A.K.P. Kludze's 'Modern Law of Succession in Ghana,' a comprehensive treatise aimed at both legal practitioners and law students. The reviewer, Osew E.A., commends the book for its thorough analysis of wills (under both statutory and customary law), intestate succession (especially under PNDCL 111), and related family law issues. Kludze critically engages with prior scholarship by Ollennu, Bentsi-Enchill, Sarbah, Danquah, and Rattray, challenging some established views and proposing reforms. Key points include questioning the continued application of English common law rules like Parker v Felgate, advocating for a prima facie right to the matrimonial home for surviving spouses, and raising sovereignty concerns about the indirect application of UK legislation through colonial statutes. The review notes minor shortcomings, including excessive length on certain theoretical discussions, omission of the Registration Law (PNDCL 112), failure to note the repeal of the Insolvency Act, and numerous typographical errors. Despite these, the book is highly recommended for its stimulating arguments, scholarly rigor, and practical relevance to Ghanaian succession law.",
