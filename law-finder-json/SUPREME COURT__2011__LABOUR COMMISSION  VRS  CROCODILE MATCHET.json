  "caseTitle": "LABOUR COMMISSION VRS CROCODILE MATCHET",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana judgment arose from a labor dispute where the National Labour Commission (NLC) sought enforcement of its order against Crocodile Matchets Ghana Ltd. for unfair termination of five employees. The NLC had appointed a two-member committee to hear the case, which issued an order later enforced by the High Court. The Court of Appeal set aside the decision, citing lack of quorum and improper delegation. The Supreme Court upheld this reversal, holding that Section 140(3) of the Labour Act, 2003 (Act 651) requires a quorum of five members, including tripartite representation, to settle industrial disputes. The Court found no statutory basis for a two-member panel to exercise judicial functions and emphasized that mandatory quorum provisions must be strictly observed. The appeal was dismissed, affirming that non-compliance invalidates proceedings.",
