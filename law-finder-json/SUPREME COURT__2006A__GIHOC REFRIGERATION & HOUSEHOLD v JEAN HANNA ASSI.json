  "caseTitle": "GIHOC REFRIGERATION & HOUSEHOLD v JEAN HANNA ASSI",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision arose from a land dispute over Plot No. 19, Ring Road Industrial Area, Kaneshie, Accra. The Respondent, Jean Hanna Assi, claimed ownership of the land, supported by Land Title Certificate No. GA 8570, issued under the Land Title Registration Law, 1986 (PNDCL 152). Although the Appellant, GIHOC Refrigeration & Household Products Ltd., occupied the property following state confiscation of the Respondent’s company under military regimes, the court held that the land itself was never legally confiscated. The trial judge found that the Respondent retained indefeasible title under PNDCL 152 and declared him the rightful owner. On appeal, the majority dismissed the substantive appeal but rejected the Respondent’s cross-appeal for declaration of title and recovery of possession due to lack of a formal counterclaim. Justice Akuffo (Ms), dissenting on the cross-appeal, argued that the trial court had jurisdiction to grant such reliefs based on the evidence and principles of justice, citing Order 63 Rule 6 of the former High Court Rules and the reformed Order 1 Rule 2 of C.I. 47, which prioritize effective and final resolution of disputes. She emphasized that procedural technicalities should not override substantive justice, especially where the evidence clearly established the Respondent’s ownership and entitlement to possession.",
