  "caseTitle": "OF THE COURT OF APPEAL VERSUS ARHIN DAVIS & NORTEY",
  "summary": "This Court of Appeal judgment from Ghana affirms the High Court's dismissal of a land title claim brought by Ebusuapanin Yaa Kwasi and later joined by Ebusuapanin Kwamina Badu against Arhin Davis and Nortey. The plaintiffs claimed ownership of land in Anagye, asserting ancestral possession and a prior arbitration award. The 1st defendant, Arhin Davis, relied on a 1912 judgment (LTC Davis v. Norweh) where the plaintiffs’ ancestress, Araba Ayah, testified to having sold the land at auction to his grandfather, L.T.C. Davis. The Court upheld the doctrine of estoppel per rem judicatam, holding that the plaintiffs, as successors-in-title to Araba Ayah, were bound by her prior judicial admission. Exhibits 1 (certified 1912 judgment) and 2 (1927 certified plan) were authenticated under section 146 of the Evidence Decree and deemed admissible. The Court rejected arguments that the trial was a nullity due to the late joinder of the 3rd defendant, noting he became a co-defendant and did not prejudice the plaintiffs. It also found no error in the trial judge’s reliance on the 1912 judgment or failure to require production of a certificate of purchase, as the judicial record confirmed its issuance. The 1st defendant’s capacity to sue was affirmed under Davis v. Randull (1963), recognizing Sierra Leonean familial succession in Ghanaian property. Ultimately, the appeal was dismissed, with the Court reinforcing the binding effect of prior judicial admissions in land disputes.",
