  "summary": "This compilation of unreported Ghanaian Supreme Court civil motions and appeals from 2008–2009 addresses diverse legal issues including contract disputes, land title, injunctions, and procedural fairness. Key cases involve claims for specific performance of property sale agreements, disputes over credit facility breaches leading to business collapse, and applications for declaratory relief regarding land ownership. Procedural issues such as the timeliness of applications, jurisdictional conflicts, and adherence to natural justice—particularly the right to be heard—are recurrent themes. The Court emphasized the importance of proper service, the binding effect of res judicata, and the limits on judicial authority when a stay of execution is in place. Several cases also examine the validity of ex-parte orders and their compliance with constitutional rights under the 1992 Constitution.",
