  "summary": "This was a civil appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal concerning the jurisdiction of a Native Tribunal under the Native Administration (Colony) Ordinance. The plaintiff-appellant sought an account of £45 lent to the defendant in 1900 for trading purposes, and partial repayment of £70 made in 1940. The trial judge referred the case to a Native Tribunal, holding the claim fell within its jurisdiction as the amount did not exceed £100. The appellate court allowed the appeal, ruling that the actual amount in dispute could not be determined at that stage, as the original sum might have grown significantly over 41 years of trading. Therefore, the referral was premature. The order was set aside, and the case was remitted to the Divisional Court to continue proceedings until the amount became ascertainable. If the demand was later found not to exceed £100, a referral could then be made. Costs were awarded to the appellant.",
