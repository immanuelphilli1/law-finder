  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF JAMES TAYLOR, DECEASED",
  "summary": "In this 1941 West African Court of Appeal decision, Ben Nze appealed his conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm under the Arms Ordinance. Although his counsel entered a guilty plea after partial hearing of the defense, the appellant claimed he was unaware of the plea and did not intend to plead guilty. The appellate court, citing precedents such as R. v. Baker and R. v. Hussey, held that a conviction based on a plea not personally and knowingly made is a nullity. Consequently, the appeal was allowed, the conviction and sentence were quashed, the fine was ordered to be refunded, and a retrial was directed before a competent court. The court emphasized procedural fairness and the necessity of informed, personal pleas in criminal proceedings.",
