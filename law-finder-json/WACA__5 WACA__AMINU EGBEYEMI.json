  "summary": "In this West African Court of Appeal case from 1939, Aminu Egbeyemi (respondent) sued G.B. Ollivant & Co. Ltd (appellants) to recover £101 13s. spent on purchasing land attached and sold under a writ of fi-fa in execution of a judgment against one Oseni. The sale was later set aside by the High Court due to an invalid attachment. The trial judge ruled in favor of the respondent, placing the burden on the appellants to prove the attachment's validity. The appellate court reversed this decision, holding that the principle of caveat emptor applied, there was no covenant for title, and no fraud or misrepresentation by the appellants. It emphasized that a purchaser must verify title before buying, especially in execution sales, and that the mere invalidity of an attachment does not create a cause of action. The appeal was allowed, judgment entered for the defendants, and costs awarded accordingly.",
