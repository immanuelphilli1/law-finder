  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana reviewed an appeal arising from a default judgment entered by the High Court in favor of the plaintiff, African Distributors Company Ltd., against the Commissioner of Customs, Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS). The plaintiff claimed $130,000 for undelivered second-hand clothing, but the High Court awarded $92,600 without any prior admission or amended pleading. The Court of Appeal set aside the judgment due to procedural irregularities, including lack of notice of adjournment from December 13 to 14, 2005, and the unexplained reduction in the awarded sum. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal's decision, holding that a default judgment must reflect the exact amount claimed unless amended or admitted, and that the procedural flaws constituted a miscarriage of justice. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the need for strict adherence to civil procedure rules.",
