  "caseTitle": "BOOK REVIEW MODERN PRINCIPLES OF EQUITY [1987-88] VOL. XVI",
  "summary": "This document is a book review of 'Modern Principles of Equity' by A.K.P. Kludze, published in 1988, assessing its contribution to Ghanaian and Anglophone African equity and trust law. The reviewer praises the work as a comprehensive and pioneering textbook addressing core equitable doctrines such as specific performance, injunctions, rectification, rescission, trusts, and mortgages, with particular emphasis on their relevance to Ghana. Kludze critiques the re-introduction of the 'principles of natural justice, equity and good conscience' as a test for customary law under section 49 of the Courts Act, 1971, and urges Ghanaian courts to adapt English precedents to local realities. He proposes legal reforms, including validating half-secret trusts if communicated before death, allowing trustee reliance on expert advice, and abolishing the mutuality requirement for specific performance. The book offers the most detailed treatment of Ghanaian mortgage law and customary pledges. Despite numerous typographical errors and some underdeveloped arguments—such as on interim injunction standards and charitable trusts—the reviewer highly commends the work for clarifying complex issues and advancing legal scholarship in Ghana, acknowledging the author's perseverance amid publication challenges.",
