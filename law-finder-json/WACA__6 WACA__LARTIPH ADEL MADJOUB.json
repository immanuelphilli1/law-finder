  "caseTitle": "LARTIPH ADEL MADJOUB",
  "summary": "This civil appeal arose from a claim by Lartiph Adel Madjoub against the Adansi Stool and others for GH\u000175 advanced under a promissory note and receipt, with the claim based on failure of consideration due to non-grant of concessions. At trial, no formal pleadings were filed. After the plaintiff closed his case, the defendants raised for the first time a defence under Ashanti Proclamation No. 4 of 1928, which required the concurrence of the Oman Council and Queen-Mother for a stool debt to be valid. The trial judge non-suited the plaintiff based on lack of such concurrence, despite this issue not being part of the agreed issues or raised in opening statements. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that the judgment could not stand because it was based on a defence not properly pleaded or in issue, and there was no evidence to support the finding of lack of concurrence. The court emphasized the necessity of pleadings to prevent procedural surprise and adherence to settled issues. The appeal was allowed, the judgment set aside, and the case remitted for retrial before another judge, with liberty for the defendants to plead non-compliance with the proclamation.",
