  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case, Delmas Agencies (Gh) Ltd v Food Distributors International Ltd, arose from a dispute over the alleged loss of 6,234 cartons of yams at Tema Port in October 1993. The plaintiff claimed the defendant, as shipping agent, negligently left the yams exposed to rain, rendering them unfit for export. The High Court awarded damages based on $16 per carton for value and $40 for profit, plus interest and costs. The Court of Appeal upheld liability but found the evidence insufficient to support the measure of damages, yet still awarded $200,000. The Supreme Court reviewed the case and emphasized that the plaintiff failed to provide corroborated evidence for the claimed prices and profits. Receipts showed payments inconsistent with the claimed per-carton cost, and the plaintiff's witness gave unreliable testimony. The court held that the award of damages was unjustified where the evidence did not prove the loss on a balance of probabilities, highlighting the necessity of credible, corroborated evidence in civil claims for damages.",
