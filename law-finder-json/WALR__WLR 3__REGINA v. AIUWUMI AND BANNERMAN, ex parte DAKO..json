  "summary": "In Regina v. Aiuwumi and Bannerman, ex parte Dako, the applicant sought an extension of time under Supreme Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954, Ord. 64, r. 6, to apply for certiorari or mandamus to challenge a District Magistrate's 1955 order authorizing the sale of his property by the Accra Municipal Council. The property was sold in 1956, and purchasers obtained a certificate of purchase. The applicant, out of time, applied in 1957 for relief. The court held that while Ord. 59, r. 3 imposes a six-month time limit for certiorari applications, the court retains power under Ord. 64, r. 6 to extend time unless a rule explicitly excludes such power. The marginal note referencing time limits for mandamus was deemed non-binding, and thus no time restriction applies to mandamus. The court granted the extension, emphasizing no injustice to the purchasers and the seriousness of the miscarriage of justice suffered by the applicant.",
