  "caseTitle": "MAKATA VERSUS AHORLI AND",
  "summary": "In Makata v. Ahorli and Others (1956) WLR 1, the West African Court of Appeal addressed issues of native customary law, procedural validity in Native Courts, and appeal requirements. The plaintiff claimed succession to family land after paying his uncle's funeral expenses and being appointed by family elders. The Agave Native Court's majority awarded him title, but the President dissented and did not sign the order. On appeal, the Lands Division reversed, citing procedural defects and misapplication of custom. The appellate court held that under Gold Coast native custom, family elders may appoint a successor to family property, conferring an inalienable life interest. The failure of the dissenting President to sign the order did not invalidate the majority judgment under section 7(1) of the Native Courts Ordinance. Additionally, only the first and second defendants had signed the notice of appeal; others were not joined due to lack of statutory authority. The appeal was allowed, reinstating the Native Court's decision.",
