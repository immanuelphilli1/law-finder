  "caseTitle": "DAVID OKOYE",
  "summary": "This case involved a boundary dispute between the Ogidi and Obunike peoples in colonial Ghana, where the plaintiff sought a declaration that the old Awka-Onitsha road was the true boundary. The trial judge ruled in favor of the Ogidi people, finding that a District Officer had mistakenly marked the boundary along the new Awka road, contrary to the 1914 Native Court judgment which referenced the old road. The West Africa Court of Appeal upheld the decision, emphasizing credible and reliable evidence from witnesses including Archdeacon Basden, the Eze Ani of Ozeh, Benjamin Amobi, and Obianyu—the presiding chief of the 1914 court. The court found no basis to overturn the trial judge’s assessment of witness credibility or the weight of evidence, dismissing the appeal with costs. The judgment clarified that the prolonged conflict resulted from administrative error, not legal ambiguity.",
