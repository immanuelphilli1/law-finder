  "caseTitle": "ELLIS TAMAKLOE v THE REPUBLIC",
  "summary": "Ellis Tamakloe appealed his conviction and 10-year sentence for attempted exportation and possession of 695g of Cannabis Sativa without lawful authority under PNDCL 236. The Supreme Court of Ghana upheld the conviction, finding that circumstantial evidence—including the appellant's admission of receiving and handing over the parcel, his handwritten details on the airway bill, and failure to correct the sender's address—supported an irresistible inference of guilt. The court held that physical and constructive possession was proven, and knowledge of the drug's nature could be inferred from the appellant's conduct. The appeal was dismissed as the trial and appellate courts correctly applied the law on circumstantial evidence, particularly the principle that guilt must follow necessarily from established facts, as affirmed in The State v Anani Fiadzo.",
