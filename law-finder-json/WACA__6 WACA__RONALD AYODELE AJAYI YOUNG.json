  "summary": "This 1940 West Africa Court of Appeal decision concerned a dispute over the validity of a mortgage and conveyance involving property devised under a will in Lagos, Nigeria. The testatrix, Elizabeth John, devised real property to Benjamin Young and his heirs in trust as family property, prohibiting sale or partition. Her executors granted a fresh mortgage post-death, and later, Young conveyed the property to Badaru Abina. The plaintiffs, Young’s children, sought to set aside the conveyance and mortgage, and demanded an account of rents. The court held that the Land Transfer Act 1897 was a statute of general application in Nigeria, empowering executors to mortgage the property. It affirmed the mortgage's validity but set aside Young’s conveyance. The court also ordered the mortgagee’s personal representatives to render an account of rents, recognizing their duty as equitable mortgagees in possession.",
