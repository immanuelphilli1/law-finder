  "summary": "The Court of Appeal of Ghana in Isaac K. Kobi & 24 Others v. Ghana Manganese Company Ltd. (2004) addressed the wrongful termination of 25 employees following a strike action on May 19, 1999. The employer classified the strike as violent and required workers to sign a 'Declaration of Renewal of Confidence and Loyalty' to resume work. Although most workers complied, the appellants were dismissed with service certificates citing 'Not re-admitted after closure of the mine in May 1999.' The High Court dismissed their claims, ruling the strike illegal under the Industrial Relations Act, 1965 (Act 299). On appeal, the Court found that several appellants had no involvement in the strike—some were on leave, sick, or off-duty—and were not individually implicated. The Court held that the employer failed to prove their participation, and the uncorroborated testimony of the Resident Director was insufficient to justify termination. The appeal was allowed, and the case remitted for individual assessment of damages.",
