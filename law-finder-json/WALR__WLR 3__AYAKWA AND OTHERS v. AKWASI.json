  "summary": "In Ayakwa and Others v. Akwasi, the Supreme Court of Ghana's Ashanti Judicial Division held that the Governor-General's appointment of a Committee of Inquiry under section 13(1) of the State Councils (Ashanti) Ordinance, 1952, was ultra vires. The State Council had already conducted an inquiry into destoolment charges against Nana Akyeampong Akwasi II, Agonahene, and dismissed the case due to the complainants' lack of standing. Since the matter had been disposed of and was under appeal, it no longer met the conditions for the Governor-General's intervention under s.13(1), which requires that it be inexpedient, delayed, or beyond the Council's cognizance. The court granted writs of certiorari and prohibition, quashing the appointment and barring the Committee from proceeding.",
