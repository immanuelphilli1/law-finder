  "caseTitle": "ISAAC THEOPHILUS AKKUNNA WALLACE­JOHNSON",
  "summary": "This case involved an appeal by Isaac Theophilus Akkunna Wallace-Johnson against his conviction for publishing and possessing seditious materials under section 330 of the Gold Coast Criminal Code. The appellant had authored an article criticizing colonial rule, accusing European administrators of using deceit, force, and oppressive laws to subjugate Africans. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council upheld the conviction, ruling that the statutory definition of 'seditious intention' in the Gold Coast Criminal Code did not require proof of incitement to violence or extrinsic evidence of intent. The Court emphasized that the words themselves, if expressive of hostility toward the government, were sufficient to constitute sedition. It rejected reliance on English common law precedents, affirming that the Code was a comprehensive and autonomous statement of law tailored to colonial conditions. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the lower courts' decisions.",
