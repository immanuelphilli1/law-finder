  "caseTitle": "NSIAH VERSUS ANANE AND OTHERS.",
  "summary": "This 1956 Supreme Court of the Gold Coast decision involved a negligence claim by the plaintiff, Nsiah, who suffered severe injuries—including amputation of his right arm—when the lorry he was travelling in collided with another vehicle. The plaintiff sued four defendants as joint tortfeasors, alleging negligence in the operation of both vehicles. The first and second defendants did not appear, leading to an interlocutory judgment against them. The third and fourth defendants denied liability, alleging contributory negligence or voluntary assumption of risk by the plaintiff. The court found both drivers were negligent, rejected defences of contributory negligence and volenti non fit injuria due to lack of evidence, and awarded the plaintiff £1,500 in general damages plus special damages. The judgment emphasized the plaintiff’s loss of earning capacity and physical incapacity, noting his age and 60% disability.",
