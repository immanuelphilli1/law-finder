  "summary": "In ASCHKAR v. SOMUAH AND OTHERS (1957), the West African Court of Appeal upheld a landlord's application under section 11(1)(e) of the Rent Control Ordinance, 1952, for recovery of possession to carry out a redevelopment scheme. The defendants, tenants, argued the scheme was a pretext to evict them and that redevelopment must serve public interest. The court held that the Ordinance does not require public interest as a condition, and the true test is whether the scheme can be executed only if possession is regained. Evidence showed the landlord had obtained planning approval and taken concrete steps, establishing bona fides. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
