  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana, in Janet Naakarley Amegatcher v. Attorney-General & Others (2012), addressed the proper parties in civil proceedings against the state under Article 88(5) of the 1992 Constitution. The plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of newly created District Assemblies. The Court held that while Article 88(5) designates the Attorney-General as the nominal defendant in all civil proceedings against the state, a purposive interpretation is required to uphold constitutional principles such as separation of powers and institutional autonomy. The Court ruled that independent constitutional bodies like the Electoral Commission and CHRAJ may sue or be sued in their own names to avoid conflicts of interest, especially when their interests diverge from the Executive. However, in this case, since there was no demonstrated conflict between the Attorney-General and Parliament or the Minister of Local Government, and no independent cause of action against the Electoral Commission, those parties were struck out. The decision affirmed a nuanced, context-sensitive application of Article 88(5), balancing textual clarity with constitutional values.",
