  "caseTitle": "AND OTHERS VERSUS PABI",
  "summary": "In Lartey and Others v. Pabi, the plaintiffs sought to reopen loan transactions with the defendant, alleging excessive interest and improper deductions. The defendant admitted charging 30% annual interest on loans totaling £700, exceeding the legal cap under the Moneylenders Ordinance. The court held that the defendant was a moneylender by operation of law under section 3 due to lending at interest, triggering the court's discretion under the Loans Recovery Ordinance to reopen the transaction and cap interest at the statutory maximum. However, the court rejected the plaintiffs' claims of rent being £150 annually and deductions for 'drinks,' relying on unambiguous documentary evidence showing £30 as full rent payment. It also ruled that section 19 of the Moneylenders Ordinance, requiring record-keeping, did not apply to individuals deemed moneylenders under section 3 rather than those carrying on moneylending as a business under section 2, and was inapplicable where the debtor, not the lender, initiated the action.",
