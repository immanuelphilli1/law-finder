  "caseTitle": "AKUMAGLO VERSUS UNITED AFRICA",
  "summary": "In this civil appeal, the Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the lower court, holding that the trial judge had misdirected himself on the evidence. The incident involved a lorry owned by the plaintiff that ran backwards into a river after the defendant's pontoon tilted upon impact with the river bank. The appellate court found that the defendant's servants were negligent in their handling of the pontoon, which directly led to the accident. The reversal was grounded on the proper interpretation of the evidence regarding causation and negligence.",
