  "summary": "This case involved a land ownership dispute between the Anyigbe and Fieve tribes in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), initially decided in favor of the Fieve tribe by the High Native Tribunal of Ada. The Anyigbe tribe appealed to the Provincial Commissioner's Court, which reversed the decision. The respondents then appealed to the West African Court of Appeal, arguing that the Provincial Commissioner lacked jurisdiction because no record showed the appellant had first sought leave to appeal from the Paramount Chief's Tribunal as required by Section 77(1) of the Native Administration Ordinance (1927). The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, setting aside the Provincial Commissioner’s judgment. On further appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the key issue was whether the 1935 Amendment Ordinance’s proviso—allowing the West African Court of Appeal to exercise discretion to hear appeals for substantial justice—applied to the entire Section 77. The Privy Council held that the proviso applied to both subsections of Section 77 and that the Court of Appeal had erred in refusing to exercise its discretion based solely on the procedural omission. The order was discharged, and the matter remitted for rehearing, with guidance to consider whether the failure to apply for leave was deliberate, accidental, or due to a bona fide mistake.",
