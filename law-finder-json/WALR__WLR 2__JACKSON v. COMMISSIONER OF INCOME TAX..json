  "caseTitle": "JACKSON VERSUS COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX.",
  "summary": "In Jackson v. Commissioner of Income Tax, the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast ruled that retroactive salary arrears paid in 1947 could not be apportioned across prior years for income tax assessment. The taxpayer, a judge, received a lump sum for salary increases retroactive to January 1946, but the court held that since no legal entitlement or debt existed for these arrears during the earlier years, they could not form part of the assessable income for those periods. Relying on the wording of the Income Tax Ordinance, particularly sections 53 and 18(1), and distinguishing UK precedents due to the absence of an equivalent to Schedule E, Rule 5, the court concluded that the arrears were taxable only in the year they were paid. The appeal was allowed, and the Commissioner's additional assessments for prior years were invalidated.",
