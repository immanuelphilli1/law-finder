  "summary": "In this probate dispute, the plaintiff, representing the deceased's maternal family, appealed the lower court's decision favoring the executrix wife regarding the construction of John Cassar Fry's will. The will devised \"the old one\" house to the wife and children and \"the new one\" to the maternal family. The testator owned three houses: one in Kumasi and two in Cape Coast. The central issue was whether the two Cape Coast houses together constituted \"the new one\" or if each was separately the old and new building. The West African Court of Appeal held that the will's language created a latent equivocation, making extrinsic evidence admissible to determine the testator's intent. Evidence showed the two Cape Coast houses were locally known as the 'old' and 'new' buildings. The court upheld the trial judge's interpretation that these two houses were the subject of the respective devises, rejecting the plaintiff's claim that both Cape Coast properties formed the 'new one.' The appeal was dismissed.",
