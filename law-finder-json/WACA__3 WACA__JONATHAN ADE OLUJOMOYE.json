  "caseTitle": "JONATHAN ADE OLUJOMOYE",
  "summary": "The appellant, Jonathan Ade Olujomoye, was convicted under section 309 of the Criminal Code for possessing items specially contrived for committing a crime relating to coin—specifically, paper cut to the size of West African currency notes and bearing Arabic characters. His appeal challenged the statutory interpretation of \"any instrument or thing,\" arguing for an ejusdem generis limitation, but the West Africa Court of Appeal held that \"thing\" should be broadly construed to include any item adapted for forgery. The court also affirmed that constructive possession applied, as the items were found in his wife's possession and he exercised control over her. Additionally, the court ruled that the trial judge properly allowed rebuttal evidence from prosecution witnesses after the defence case closed, as the interests of justice required it, despite no formal new facts being raised. The appeal was dismissed, with no finding of misdirection or miscarriage of justice.",
