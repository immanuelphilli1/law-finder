  "caseTitle": "OTHERS VERSUS BOATENG.",
  "summary": "This 1957 Ghanaian High Court decision, delivered by Ollennu J., addressed two key legal issues in a land dispute involving stool property. First, it clarified that under native custom, certain office holders—particularly linguists—are 'natural representatives' of a stool and may represent it in litigation without requiring written authorization from the chief, as stipulated under section 22 of the Native Courts (Southern Ghana) Ordinance. Second, the court held that a prior judgment against the defendant in his capacity as a stool occupant did not constitute res judicata in proceedings where he was sued as a private individual, as the legal personalities were distinct. The appeal was allowed, the original ruling set aside, and the case remitted for a new trial.",
