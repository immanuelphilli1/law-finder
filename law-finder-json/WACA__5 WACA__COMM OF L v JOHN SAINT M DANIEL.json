  "caseTitle": "COMM OF L v JOHN SAINT M DANIEL",
  "summary": "This West African Court of Appeal decision from 1939 concerned the assessment of compensation for property acquired by the Ghanaian government under the Public Lands Acquisition Ordinance. The trial judge had awarded £866 5s, less than the government's final offer of £1,148. The appeal court held that courts are entitled to set compensation below the government’s offer, but found error in disregarding contemporary expert valuation evidence. It further ruled that a 10% uplift for compulsory purchase has no statutory basis and is gratuitous. The appeal was allowed, and compensation was reassessed at £1,148, aligning with the government's offer based on credible expert testimony.",
