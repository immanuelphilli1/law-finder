  "caseTitle": "OF THE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA VERSUS STATES OF AMERICA",
  "summary": "This legal analysis by John Baloro examines the international legal implications of South Africa's confrontations with Frontline States during the apartheid era, drawing parallels with the ICJ's 1986 Nicaragua v. United States judgment. The paper highlights how South Africa engaged in direct military raids and indirect destabilization through surrogate rebel groups like MNR and UNITA against neighboring states supporting liberation movements such as the ANC and SWAPO. It underscores violations of sovereignty, non-intervention, and use of force under international law, emphasizing that such actions contravene principles affirmed in the Nicaragua case. The work advocates for the application of international legal norms to condemn apartheid-era aggression and support national liberation struggles in Southern Africa.",
