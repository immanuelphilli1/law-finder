  "caseTitle": "A. E. OFON I",
  "summary": "The appellant, A. E. Ofoni, was the manager of the Asaba branch of the United Africa Co. Ltd., responsible for cash, stock, and accounting records. He was convicted on ten counts relating to financial misconduct, including stealing by a clerk, obtaining money by false pretences, and fraudulent false accounting under the Criminal Code. The West Africa Court of Appeal upheld most convictions but quashed those on count 1 (stealing of ₤304 19s. 11d.) and count 10 (stealing ₤14 9s. 2d. from Onochie). The court held that a general cash deficiency without proof of specific misappropriation was insufficient for conviction under section 390(6). Additionally, the conviction on count 10 was inconsistent with count 9, as the same sum was treated both as fraudulently unrecorded company receipts and as theft from an individual. The court affirmed that the appellant's false claim of having paid the palm oil owners provided evidence of intent to defraud under section 419. Convictions on the remaining eight counts, supported by clear evidence of omissions from accounting records with fraudulent intent, were upheld.",
