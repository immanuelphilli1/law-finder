  "caseTitle": "DAVID INNER v IGUMA ARUEGBON",
  "summary": "In this West African Court of Appeal case from 1952, the appellant, Iguma Aruegbon, was found liable for malicious prosecution after fabricating a theft charge against the respondent, David Inner, to compel her return to Benin City. The court held that the appellant initiated the prosecution without reasonable and probable cause, knowing the charge was false, as the respondent had been living in Lagos since 1947 and could not have committed the alleged theft in 1949. The prosecution was deemed a deliberate abuse of legal process to facilitate service of an adultery summons by the respondent's husband. The trial judge's award of damages was upheld on appeal, with the appellate judges emphasizing the clear evidence of malice and procedural abuse.",
