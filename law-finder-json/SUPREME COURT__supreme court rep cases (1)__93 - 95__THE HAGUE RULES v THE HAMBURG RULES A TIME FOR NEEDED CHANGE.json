  "caseTitle": "THE HAGUE RULES v THE",
  "summary": "This legal commentary analyzes the inadequacies of the Hague Rules in protecting shippers, particularly in developing countries like Ghana, and advocates for the adoption of the Hamburg Rules. The Hague Rules, incorporated into Ghanaian law via the Bills of Lading Act, 1961 (Act 42), impose limited carrier liability and require due diligence to ensure seaworthiness before and at the beginning of the voyage. However, judicial interpretations in cases like Re Unus Shipping Co, Maxine Footwear, and Muncaster Castle highlight ambiguities in defining seaworthiness and due diligence, often leading to protracted litigation. The notice requirements for loss or damage are deemed impractical, especially for non-apparent defects. The author argues that the Hamburg Rules, developed under UNCTAD, offer a more balanced framework that addresses these shortcomings by modernizing language, extending carrier responsibility, and better protecting cargo interests. The paper concludes that Ghana should consider ratifying the Hamburg Rules to align its maritime law with contemporary trade realities.",
