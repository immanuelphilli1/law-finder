  "caseTitle": "SAMUEL KWASI NTIRI NARKO KONKAI TAWIAH v GBAWE MANTSE ADAM",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case, decided on 18th October 2006, involved a land dispute over a parcel at Chuim, Odorkor, between Samuel Kwasi Ntiri and Narko Konkai Tawia (Plaintiffs/Respondents) and Gbawe Mantse and Adam Kwatei Quartey (Defendants/Appellants). The Plaintiffs claimed title via a 1977 conveyance from Asere Mantse and a 1917 gift to Gbawe Tawia, seeking declaration of title, possession, damages for trespass, and injunction. The Defendants denied the claim, asserting the land was part of Gbawe family land and raising estoppel based on a prior 1961 High Court judgment. The Circuit Court initially ruled for the Plaintiffs, but the Court of Appeal partially allowed the Defendants' appeal, criticizing the trial court for relying on an incomprehensible surveyor's report, failing to address estoppel, and improperly delegating judicial functions to a surveyor. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld the Court of Appeal’s intervention, emphasizing procedural fairness, proper evidentiary evaluation, and the necessity of addressing pleaded defenses like estoppel.",
