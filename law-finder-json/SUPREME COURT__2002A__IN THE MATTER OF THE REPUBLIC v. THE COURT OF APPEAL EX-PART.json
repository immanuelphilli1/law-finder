  "summary": "The Ghanaian Supreme Court reviewed a decision by the Court of Appeal that nullified a High Court judgment due to the trial judge's failure to formally record the judgment in the Record Book after the defendant bank submitted to judgment on a pension claim. The Supreme Court held that the 'Judgment After Trial' filed by the plaintiffs, which was not contested and acted upon by all parties, constituted sufficient evidence that judgment had been pronounced. It ruled that the omission to record the judgment in the Record Book was a mere procedural irregularity, not a jurisdictional defect, and that the Court of Appeal erred in quashing all subsequent proceedings. The Court emphasized that under Order 36 r.24 of L.N. 140A, a judge need only 'direct' judgment, not personally enter it, and that the Court of Appeal should have used its powers under Rules 31 and 32 to rectify the defect rather than remit the case for a retrial. The Supreme Court quashed the Court of Appeal's decision and restored the validity of the original judgment and all consequent processes.",
