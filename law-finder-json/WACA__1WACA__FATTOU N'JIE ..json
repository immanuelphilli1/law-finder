  "summary": "This 1931 West African Court of Appeal decision in *Fattou N'jie v. Richard James Hall* centered on whether the plaintiff, Fattou N'jie, acquired ownership of property at No. 56 Leman Street, Bathurst, through adverse possession under the Limitation Acts of 1833 and 1874. The plaintiff had been placed in rent-free occupation of the property by Richard Calvert Hall in 1913 and remained there continuously after his 1922 death. The lower court dismissed her claim, ruling her possession was permissive and not adverse. The appellate court reversed, holding that under the Limitation Acts, a tenancy at will becomes possessory title after twelve years, regardless of permissive origin, provided possession is uninterrupted. The court declared the plaintiff the legal owner based on statutory limitation, emphasizing that adverse intent is unnecessary under the Acts. The judgment clarified the application of English limitation statutes in the Gambia and affirmed the extinguishment of the landlord’s title after the statutory period.",
