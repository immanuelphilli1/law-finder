  "summary": "This is a ruling by Justice A. A. Benin of the Supreme Court of Ghana in a civil motion concerning a preliminary objection to a repeat application for an interlocutory injunction pending appeal. The applicant, Daniel Mensah, had previously filed a late application to stay execution of a High Court judgment, which the Court of Appeal dismissed on 16th January 2012. Nine days later, he filed a review application, which the Court of Appeal dismissed on 8th November 2012. The applicant then appealed that review decision to the Supreme Court and filed a repeat application for interlocutory injunction. The respondents raised a preliminary objection, arguing lack of jurisdiction and procedural non-compliance. The Supreme Court dismissed the objection, holding that the appeal was validly filed against the 8th November ruling, and that under Rule 20(2) of CI 16 and Article 129(4) of the 1992 Constitution, the Court had jurisdiction to hear the application, which effectively sought a stay of execution. The Court emphasized that the substance of the application, not its label, governed its admissibility, and allowed the injunction application to proceed on its merits.",
