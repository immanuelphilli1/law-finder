  "caseTitle": "PETER EGYIN MENSAH v INTERCONTINENTAL BANK (GH) LIMITED",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision in Peter Egyin Mensah v. Intercontinental Bank (Gh) Limited (Civil Appeal No. J4/13/2009, 25 November 2009) concerns a dispute over unrecorded deposits in the savings accounts of a deceased Susu collector. The plaintiffs, as personal representatives, first obtained a default judgment ordering the bank to reconcile accounts. After the bank submitted a reconciliation report (Exhibit M), the plaintiffs filed a second suit seeking payment of GH\u000249,249.01, claiming the report was inaccurate. The defendant invoked res judicata, arguing the issue was already determined. The Court of Appeal upheld this plea, but the Supreme Court reversed, holding that the second suit raised a new issue—the validity of the reconciliation report—which was not conclusively decided in the first suit. The Court emphasized that estoppel by res judicata from a default judgment applies only to issues necessarily and precisely determined, and that the public interest in finality must be balanced against the risk of injustice. The appeal was allowed, reinstating the High Court’s judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.",
