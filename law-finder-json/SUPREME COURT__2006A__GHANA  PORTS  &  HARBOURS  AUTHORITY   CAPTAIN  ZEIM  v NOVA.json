  "caseTitle": "GHANA PORTS & HARBOURS AUTHORITY CAPTAIN ZEIM v NOVA",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case, decided on 15th November 2006, involved a civil appeal by the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority and Captain Zeim against Nova Complex Ltd, concerning the beaching of the MV Nova VIII at Paradise Beach. The plaintiff claimed the beaching was negligent or unlawful, while the defendants argued it was a lawful exercise of statutory duty due to the vessel listing and posing a maritime hazard. The High Court and Court of Appeal found for the plaintiff, holding the beaching was erroneous and awarding damages. The Supreme Court, however, found fault with the Court of Appeal's reasoning, particularly its reliance on an alleged mistaken identity of the vessel (MV Nova VIII vs. MV Nova VII) as the basis for rebutting the presumption of regularity in official duties. The Supreme Court held that the lower courts failed to properly address the core issue: whether the listing was severe enough to justify beaching under statutory safety powers. It concluded that the evidence supported the defendants' position that the action was taken in good faith under statutory duty, and thus reversed the finding of liability, dismissing the plaintiff's claim.",
