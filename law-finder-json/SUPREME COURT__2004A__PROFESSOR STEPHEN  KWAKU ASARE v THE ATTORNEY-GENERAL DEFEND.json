  "caseTitle": "DR. S. TWUM",
  "summary": "The case involves a legal dispute concerning constitutional interpretation and the powers of public office holders in Ghana. The plaintiff challenged the legality of certain executive actions, arguing that they violated constitutional provisions on separation of powers and rule of law. The Supreme Court examined the scope of presidential authority and the limits imposed by the 1992 Constitution, particularly in relation to appointments and administrative decisions. The court emphasized the importance of adherence to due process and constitutional safeguards in governmental actions. It held that any exercise of power inconsistent with constitutional mandates is null and void. The decision reaffirmed judicial oversight as a critical mechanism for maintaining constitutional governance in Ghana.",
