  "summary": "This legal commentary analyzes two key Ghanaian land law cases, Odametey v Clocuh and Nartey v Mechanical Lloyd Assembly Plant Ltd, interpreting the Land Registry Act, 1962 (Act 122). The Supreme Court, in a majority decision led by Taylor JSC, rejected the doctrine of constructive registration, holding that an unregistered instrument remains ineffective under s.24(1) regardless of presentation for registration. The court emphasized the statutory requirement for registration as a condition for legal effect. On customary law grants, the majority held that parties were bound by documentary conveyances, while Amua-Sekyi JSC opined that a prior valid customary grant extinguished the grantor's title, invalidating later transfers. The commentary also explores s.25(1)'s effect of constructive notice, suggesting landowners may be deemed to have knowledge of unauthorized registrations, potentially leading to estoppel. Administrative failures by the Land Registry, including improper re-plotting, were criticized, though the court resolved priority based on registration dates under s.26. The decisions clarify the primacy of registration, limit equitable doctrines, and highlight systemic challenges in land administration.",
