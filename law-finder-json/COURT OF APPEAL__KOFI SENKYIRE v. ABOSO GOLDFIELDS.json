  "caseTitle": "SENKYIRE v. ABOSO GOLDFIELDS",
  "summary": "In Kofi Senkyire v. Aboso Gold Fields Ltd, the Court of Appeal overturned a Circuit Court ruling that had found in favor of the plaintiff for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff, a sampler and foreman, was dismissed after being found with a sample bag containing gold-bearing rock (pyrites) at the company's security gate while leaving work. Although the disciplinary committee acknowledged the evidence was circumstantial, it concluded his actions indicated malicious intent, leading to termination. The Circuit Court held the dismissal was wrongful due to lack of direct evidence and failure to call the security officer, constituting a denial of fair hearing. However, the Court of Appeal ruled that the employee’s conduct—carrying valuable mineral samples beyond his duty station without delivering them to the geologist—was inconsistent with faithful performance of duties and prejudicial to the employer’s interests. Citing Arkhurst v. Ghana Museum and Monuments Board and Pearce v. Forster, the court affirmed that such conduct amounted to gross misconduct under the company’s conditions of service, justifying summary dismissal. The appeal was allowed, and the judgment of the Circuit Court was set aside.",
