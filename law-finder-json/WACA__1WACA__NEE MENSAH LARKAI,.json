  "summary": "This 1933 West African Court of Appeal case involved a dispute over land in Accra, originally granted to J. in 1872 as individual property. J. transferred it to his brother A. (Ahuru) in 1889, making A. the individual owner. Upon A.'s intestate death circa 1905, the land became family property under Ga customary law. The plaintiff, claiming as head of the Larkai family, sued to recover the land. The lower court found for the defendants, A.'s nieces, based on alleged gift from A. to their mother O. (Otua) or her 25 years of possession. On appeal, the court held that the plaintiff, as a male-line successor to the family stool, had no claim to family property, which descends through females. O. had succeeded as head of A.'s family and held the land in trust, so her long possession did not vest ownership. As neither party proved title, the appeal was dismissed by non-suit, with each side bearing its own costs.",
