  "caseTitle": "JAMES LATUNDE ADEROKU",
  "summary": "This 1938 West Africa Court of Appeal decision involved a consent order referring the plaintiff's claim to a referee for investigation. The appellate court found the order unreasonably vague, leading the referee to exceed his mandate by effectively conducting a trial. The plaintiff, James Latunde Aderoku, had claimed for use and occupation of his premises by the defendant, The United Africa Co. Ltd., which was in possession as a mortgagee. The referee failed to properly assess the claim or provide reasoning, and no formal set-off or counterclaim was pleaded. The appeal was allowed, the lower court's judgment set aside, and the case remitted to the High Court of Kaduna Division to determine the plaintiff's claim for an account, with liberty to amend pleadings. Costs were left to the discretion of the trial judge due to the consensual and ambiguous nature of the original referral.",
