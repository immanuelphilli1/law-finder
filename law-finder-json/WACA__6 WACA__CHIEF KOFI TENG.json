  "summary": "In this 1940 West Africa Court of Appeal decision, Chief Kofi Teng (Plaintiff-Respondent) claimed title and possession of land allegedly purchased from Saforo Yirenkyi on 11 June 1937. The property was attached on 18 June 1937 under a writ of Fi.Fa., and later sold at public auction on 12 July 1937 to N. J. Annan (Defendant-Appellant), who received a Certificate of Purchase. A conveyance from Yirenkyi to the Plaintiff was executed on 5 July 1937. The Plaintiff previously sued Yirenkyi for breach of covenant of title, obtaining a non-suit judgment that recognized his legal title. In the current action against Annan, the lower court relied on res judicata from the prior judgment. The appellate court held that res judicata did not apply because Annan was not a party or privy to the earlier suit. The appeal was allowed, the judgment set aside, and the case remitted for retrial on the central factual issue: whether a valid sale occurred on 11 June 1937, prior to attachment. Costs of appeal were awarded to the Appellant.",
