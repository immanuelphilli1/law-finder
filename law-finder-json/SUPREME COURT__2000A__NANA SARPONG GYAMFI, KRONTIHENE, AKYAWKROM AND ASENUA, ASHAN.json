  "summary": "In this 2000 Supreme Court of Ghana case, Nana Sarpong Gyamfi, the Krontihene of Akyawkrom and Asenua, brought an action against Nana Kwaku Dakore II (also known as Kwaku Okyere), the Gyasehene, seeking a declaration that the defendant was disqualified from holding chieftaincy office due to a prior conviction for an offence involving moral turpitude. The defendant had been convicted in 1986 by the Circuit Court, Kumasi, and his appeal was dismissed by the High Court in 1990. The plaintiff argued that under Article 275 of the 1992 Constitution, such a conviction disqualified him from being a chief. However, the Supreme Court held that although the claim was framed constitutionally, its substance involved a chieftaincy matter, over which the court lacks original jurisdiction pursuant to Section 66 of the Chieftaincy Act 1971 (Act 370). The court therefore declined jurisdiction, affirming that such disputes must be resolved by the appropriate traditional councils and regional houses of chiefs.",
