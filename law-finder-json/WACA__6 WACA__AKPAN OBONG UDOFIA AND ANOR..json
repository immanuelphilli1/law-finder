  "caseTitle": "AKPAN OBONG UDOFIA AND ANOR.",
  "summary": "This civil appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal arose from a land boundary dispute in Uruan Native Court, later transferred to the High Court and consolidated with other cases. The plaintiffs sought a declaration of title to Ikpa land, claiming exclusive use and defined boundaries marked on a plan. The trial court granted judgment but failed to clearly define the eastern boundary beyond the African Mission and the southern boundary near Esuk Utatan, leading to uncertainty. The appellate court held that a declaration of title requires precise boundary definition, citing Baruwa v. Ogunshola. The judgment was therefore set aside for legal uncertainty. The court also ruled that the amendment of the claim was permissible, as the original writ broadly covered land extent determination, and that withdrawn pleadings could not serve as binding admissions. Emphasizing clarity, the court recommended that land plans be formally integrated into judgments. The appeal was allowed, the judgment reversed, and the case remitted for retrial before a different judge, with costs awarded to the appellants and a refund ordered for any sums paid under the vacated judgment.",
