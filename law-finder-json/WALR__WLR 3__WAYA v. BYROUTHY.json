  "caseTitle": "WAYA VERSUS BYROUTHY",
  "summary": "In WAYA v. BYROUTHY, the High Court of Ghana held that the defendant, Byrouthy, wrongfully seized and sold a lorry belonging to the plaintiff, Waya. The lorry had been purchased by Waya on credit from Wilson, with no fixed instalment terms. Wilson seized the lorry for non-payment, but the court found this seizure unlawful as ownership had passed to Waya upon delivery. Byrouthy later paid the outstanding balance to Wilson on Waya's behalf and obtained a receipt, but Wilson had no ownership to transfer. A subsequent hire-purchase agreement, signed by the illiterate Waya via thumbprint, was unenforceable because Byrouthy lacked title to the vehicle and failed to prove the document was read and interpreted to Waya. The court ruled the seizure constituted conversion, awarding Waya damages for the value of the lorry and loss of earnings.",
