  "caseTitle": "FRANCIS ANSAH",
  "summary": "In this West Africa Court of Appeal case from 1938, Francis Ansah, the appellant, sought an injunction to prevent the respondents, Amalgamated Banket Areas Limited and A.E. Huckin, from demolishing a house he had purchased and improved on land leased under a written agreement. He claimed he did not understand the agreement at the time of signing, rendering it void. The trial judge accepted that the respondents failed to prove he understood the agreement but dismissed the claim on the basis of an assumed verbal tenancy. The appellate court held that if the written agreement was void due to lack of understanding, there was no agreement at all—parties were never ad idem. The respondents had let the appellant into possession under a mistake of fact, and the appellant obtained possession under mutual mistake. Thus, the respondents were entitled to oust him. The appellant could remove his building under native law and custom but had not done so. The onus to prove entitlement to compensation under native law and custom lay with the appellant, which he failed to discharge. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
