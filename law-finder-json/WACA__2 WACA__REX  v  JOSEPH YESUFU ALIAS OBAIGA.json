  "summary": "In Rex v Joseph Yesufu Alias Obaiaga, the West Africa Court of Appeal reviewed the appellant's conviction on multiple counts including receiving stolen property and preparation for coining under section 14B(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant was convicted of receiving stolen goods valued at five shillings and sentenced to two years' hard labour, and separately convicted of possessing a mould resembling a Nigerian silver shilling, receiving an eight-year concurrent sentence. On appeal, the court upheld the conviction for receiving stolen property but found insufficient evidence to support the coining charge, quashing that conviction. The trial judge had expressed doubt about whether the accused placed the mould in his pocket, particularly noting its weight and the lack of immediate detection. The appellate court emphasized that the accused was not obligated to explain the item's presence and that circumstantial evidence—including bellows, tools, and charcoal—was inconclusive, especially given the appellant's claim to be a goldsmith. The court reduced the sentence for receiving stolen property from two years to six months, deeming the original punishment excessive for such a minor offence.",
