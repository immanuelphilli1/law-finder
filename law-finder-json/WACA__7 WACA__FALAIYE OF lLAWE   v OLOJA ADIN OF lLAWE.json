  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION BY EUTITHIOS HAGGE LAMBROU Applicant-Appellant",
  "summary": "This 1941 West Africa Court of Appeal decision arose from an order by a High Court judge that a solicitor, Mr. Eutithios Hagge Lambrou, personally pay costs due to alleged misconduct in filing a writ of summons in the Magistrate's Court for possession of a house. The Court of Appeal held that the writ was properly issued under section 32(b) of the Protectorate Courts Ordinance, as the claim was a landlord-tenant dispute within the Magistrate's jurisdiction at the time of filing. The jurisdictional issue only emerged after the defendant's statement of defence raised title to land, triggering the proviso to section 32(b). The appellate court found the lower judge misdirected himself and set aside the cost order, directing that the solicitor be refunded.",
