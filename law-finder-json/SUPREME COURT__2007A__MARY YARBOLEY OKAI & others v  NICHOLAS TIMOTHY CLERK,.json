  "caseTitle": "MARY YARBOLEY OKAI & others v NICHOLAS TIMOTHY CLERK,",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case (Civil Appeal No. J4/5/2007, decided on 23rd March 2007) involved a dispute over a leasehold property originally owned by Mark George Okai, who died intestate in 1939. His daughters leased the property to Nicholas Timothy Clerk (N.T. Clerk) for 60 years from 1945 at £60 per year. Clerk paid some rent until April 1964 but failed to comply with a West African Court of Appeal (WACA) order requiring him to demolish the structure and rebuild at his own expense. In 1983, the surviving children of Mark Okai sued for rent arrears, mesne profits, and forfeiture of the lease due to breach of covenant and non-compliance with the WACA order. The defence claimed Clerk had acquired the property through a public auction and subsequent resale, registered in 1953, thus nullifying the lease. However, this defence was rejected as it was not raised in the original defendant's pleadings and lacked supporting evidence. The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' rulings, affirming forfeiture of the lease and liability for arrears, emphasizing the inconsistency and late emergence of the auction defence and the absence of proof of compliance with the WACA order.",
