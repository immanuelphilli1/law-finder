  "summary": "This Court of Appeal decision from May 11, 2000, concerns a chieftaincy dispute between the Kralongo and Petelli Royal Families of the Banda Traditional Area in Ghana over the rotatory succession to the Paramount Stool. The Brong Ahafo Regional House of Chiefs, affirmed by the National House of Chiefs and the Supreme Court, ruled that the stool rotates between the two families and ordered the Kralongo Family to hand over the Black Stool to the Petelli Family by November 15, 1988. Despite this, the Kralongo Family retained possession and in 1997 enstooled Osabarima Okokyeredom Kwadwo Sito I as Paramount Chief. The appellant, Opanin Kwadwo Fordjour, sought contempt proceedings against the respondent for disregarding court orders. The High Court failed to rule on contempt, prompting an appeal. The Court of Appeal held that the respondent’s enstoolment and public conduct as chief, despite knowledge of the court orders, constituted contempt, emphasizing that even non-parties can be liable for undermining judicial authority.",
