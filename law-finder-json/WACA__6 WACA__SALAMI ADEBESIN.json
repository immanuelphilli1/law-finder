  "caseTitle": "SALAMI ADEBESIN",
  "summary": "This 1940 West Africa Court of Appeal decision involved two appellants, Salami Adeb esin and Titani Ker ede, who were convicted in the Ibadan High Court on two counts: burglary and stealing under section 411(1) of the Criminal Code, and robbery under section 402 of the same code. Both were sentenced to concurrent terms, but the Crown appealed the leniency of the sentences. The appellate court, citing the appellants' involvement in an armed gang and the first appellant's prior convictions for violent offenses, exercised its authority to enhance the sentences. The original sentences were quashed and replaced with longer terms to better protect the public.",
