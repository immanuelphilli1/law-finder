  "caseTitle": "AND OTHERS VERSUS BANK OF WEST AFRICA, LTD.",
  "summary": "In Francois and Others v. Bank of West Africa, Ltd., the High Court of Ghana held that George James Christian had created a valid express trust during his lifetime by establishing a dedicated bank account titled 'Miss Maude Christian Memorial Fund' to honor his deceased daughter. Despite not disposing of the fund in his will or codicils, the court found that the designation of the account, coupled with correspondence showing his intent to donate the funds to the Gold Coast government for equipping a maternity ward and providing X-ray equipment, constituted a binding trust. The court ruled that Christian had appointed himself as trustee and that his executors, as successors, were obligated to carry out the trust's purpose by transferring the funds to the Ministry of Health. The fund was not to be treated as part of the residuary estate. The decision underscores that a clear declaration of trust and consistent conduct can create an enforceable obligation, even absent formal testamentary inclusion.",
