  "caseTitle": "SAID AJAMI v THE COMPTROLLER OF CUSTOMS",
  "summary": "This appeal before the West African Court of Appeal concerned the admissibility of expert testimony regarding the legal tender status of French Colonial Franc Notes. The appellant, Said Ajami, was penalized by the Comptroller of Customs for attempting to export the notes from Nigeria, prohibited under the Exchange Control and Customs Ordinances. The Comptroller relied on the testimony of Greenway, Manager of Barclays Bank, Kano, with 32 years of banking experience (24 in Nigeria), who stated the notes were legal tender in French West Africa. Though no formal averment was made under section 245 of the Customs Ordinance, the court held that Greenway’s extensive experience and role as a manager of an authorized foreign exchange dealer provided him with 'peculiar means of knowledge' and public duties requiring expertise, satisfying the 'specially skilled' standard under section 56 of the Evidence Ordinance. The court affirmed the lower courts’ decisions, dismissing the appeal with costs.",
