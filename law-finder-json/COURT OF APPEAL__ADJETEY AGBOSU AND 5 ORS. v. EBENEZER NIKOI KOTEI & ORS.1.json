  "summary": "This Court of Appeal judgment from Ghana, delivered on 30th May 2002 in case CA 137/2000, involved a land dispute between the Adjetey Agbosu and Okpalor Sowah Din families (plaintiffs/respondents) and Ebenezer Nikoi Kotey, representing the Ashaley Botwe Family (defendant/appellant). The plaintiffs challenged the validity of a 1976 Statutory Declaration (AC4345/76, reg. 761/77) registered by the Ashaley Botwe Family, claiming it encroached on their ancestral lands. The High Court had ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, granting declarations of title, cancellation of the declaration, and injunctions. On appeal, the Court of Appeal overturned the decision primarily due to the plaintiffs’ lack of legal capacity to sue. The plaintiffs, who claimed to be principal elders or family heads, failed to prove their authority or headship, especially after a late amendment to their pleadings post-trial. Additionally, they did not present a surveyor’s plan to demarcate the specific land in dispute, undermining their claim. The appellate court held that the trial judge erred in allowing the amendment and in failing to rule on the capacity issue, ultimately dismissing the appeal and setting aside the High Court’s judgment.",
