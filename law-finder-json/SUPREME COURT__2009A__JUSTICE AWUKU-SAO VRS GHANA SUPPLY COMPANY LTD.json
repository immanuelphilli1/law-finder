  "caseTitle": "JUSTICE AWUKU-SAO VRS GHANA SUPPLY COMPANY LTD",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed the appeal filed by Justice Awuku-Sao, former Managing Director of Ghana Supply Company Ltd, who challenged his summary dismissal following a forensic audit conducted during his leave. The plaintiff argued that his dismissal violated both the disciplinary procedures outlined in the company's Conditions of Service for Senior Staff (Exhibit 'F') and the principles of natural justice, particularly audi alteram partem. The courts below held that as Chief Executive, he was not covered by Exhibit 'F' due to structural incompatibility, and that submitting comments on the draft audit report constituted a hearing. The Supreme Court affirmed these findings, ruling that the special terms of his appointment letter (Exhibit 'A') prevailed and that administrative fairness under Article 23 of the 1992 Constitution was satisfied. It also upheld the lower courts' determination that the defendant was not liable for defamation, as the publications were deemed privileged and in the public interest.",
