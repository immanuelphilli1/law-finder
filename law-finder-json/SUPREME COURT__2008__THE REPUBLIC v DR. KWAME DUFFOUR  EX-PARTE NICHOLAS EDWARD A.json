  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC v DR. KWAME DUFFOUR EX-PARTE NICHOLAS EDWARD A",
  "summary": "This 2008 Supreme Court of Ghana ruling addressed an application for committal for contempt against Dr. Kwame Duffour, arising from alleged non-compliance with a 2006 judgment in Civil Appeal No. J4/25/2005. The court dismissed the contempt application on three grounds: (1) declaratory reliefs, such as those affirming the applicant's shareholding and directorship, are not enforceable by contempt; (2) the act of initiating a fresh suit on the same facts does not constitute contempt, as parties may choose how to treat a judgment by agreement; and (3) the executable orders in question were originally made by the Court of Appeal and merely confirmed by the Supreme Court, meaning enforcement must be sought from the Court of Appeal, not the Supreme Court. The ruling clarified that confirmed appellate orders remain the orders of the lower court and that the Supreme Court lacks inherent jurisdiction to enforce them via contempt proceedings.",
