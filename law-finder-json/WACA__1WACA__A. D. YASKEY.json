  "caseTitle": "A. D. YASKEY",
  "summary": "The plaintiff-appellant sought leave to appeal against a judgment of the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone and requested permission to proceed in forma pauperis. The West African Court of Appeal held that it had the discretionary power under Section 6A of the West African Court of Appeal (Civil Cases) Ordinance, 1929, to entertain appeals on any terms, including waiving fees. However, following the precedent in Kydd v. Liverpool Watch Committee, the Court ruled that the applicant's monthly pension of £2 10s. must be considered part of his means, disqualifying him from in forma pauperis status as he did not meet the financial threshold. While the full relief was denied, the Court exercised its discretion under Rule 31 to waive court fees and required security of 25 guineas for respondent's costs. The decision underscores the importance of comprehensive means assessment in pauperism applications and the Court’s equitable powers in civil procedure.",
