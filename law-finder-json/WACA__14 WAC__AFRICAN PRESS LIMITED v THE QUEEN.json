  "caseTitle": "AFRICAN PRESS LIMITED v THE QUEEN",
  "summary": "The African Press Limited appealed against a conviction for printing a seditious libel, arguing that the publication was lawful criticism under exceptions in section 50(2) of the Criminal Code. The West Africa Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, finding that while criticism of the Macpherson Constitution and administrative officers did not inherently bring the Governor or Government into contempt, the article's primary effect was to incite hostility and raise disaffection among inhabitants of Nigeria. The court emphasized that the article failed to specify defects or propose remedies, instead portraying administrative officers as hidden enemies of national freedom, thus falling outside protected criticism. The appeal was dismissed.",
