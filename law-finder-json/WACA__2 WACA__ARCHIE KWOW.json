  "caseTitle": "ARCHIE KWOW",
  "summary": "This was an appeal from a decision of the Court of the Provincial Commissioner which had dismissed an appeal from a Native Tribunal on the grounds that the case was a money claim. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that the real issue in the dispute—whether the plaintiff was entitled to a two-thirds or one-third share of land rent—related to the ownership of land, thus falling within section 75 of the Native Administration Ordinance (Cap. 111). Therefore, an appeal to the Provincial Commissioner's Court was properly maintainable. The appeal was allowed, the case remitted for decision on its merits, and costs awarded to the appellant.",
