  "summary": "This 1935 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Ghana (then Gold Coast) reviewed the conviction of C.B. Seraphim under section 4(6) of the Gold Mining Products Protection Ordinance Cap. 6/j. The court upheld two convictions but overturned the conviction for carrying on a goldsmith business without a license. The appellate judges found that the definition of a goldsmith required being a worker/dealer in non-mining gold or a seller of gold articles, but there was no evidence the appellant sold such items. Crucially, the prosecution's case relied on proving the gold was a 'mining product,' which contradicted the basis for the goldsmith charge. The court held that the Police Magistrate erred in assuming unassayed gold was not a mining product after rejecting the defense's similar claim, creating mutually inconsistent convictions. As a result, the goldsmith conviction and sentence were annulled.",
