  "summary": "In this criminal appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana, Nana Osei Kwadjo II challenged his conviction for stealing stool land revenues. The central issue was whether the prosecution proved a dishonest appropriation under Section 120 of the Criminal Code (Act 29). Justice Kpegah, in a concurring opinion, held that the conviction was fundamentally flawed because the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case, meaning the burden of proof never shifted to the appellant to enter a defence. He emphasized that the appellant's 'claim of right in good faith'—supported by Exhibit 2, a letter from a Lands Commission official acknowledging historical collection practices—constituted a complete defence to stealing. The trial and appellate courts erred by treating the defence as mere ignorance of law rather than a factual belief in entitlement. The Supreme Court, exercising its full appellate jurisdiction, allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction, and underscored the importance of protecting individual fundamental rights under Chapter Five of the 1992 Constitution.",
