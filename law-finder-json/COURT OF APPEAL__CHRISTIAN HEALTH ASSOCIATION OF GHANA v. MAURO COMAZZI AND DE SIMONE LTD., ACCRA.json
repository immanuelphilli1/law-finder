  "summary": "The Court of Appeal of Ghana reversed a High Court ruling that dismissed De Simone Ltd.'s claim to ownership of a Fiat Tempra (GR 6333B) seized in execution proceedings. The High Court had presumed the judgment debtor owned the vehicle based on possession, relying on s.48 of the Evidence Decree. The Court of Appeal held that the presumption was rebutted by clear and unrebutted affidavit evidence from International Automobile Ltd. and De Simone Ltd. showing the car was sold and delivered to De Simone Ltd. in 1995, with insurance taken out in their name. The court emphasized that mere possession—especially by the debtor's wife—does not establish ownership, and that registration is not a precondition for ownership under the Sale of Goods Act. The appeal was allowed, and the lower court's award of costs was set aside.",
