  "caseTitle": "MADAM LINDA SAGOE, MADAM VICTORIA ALLOTEY, BENJAMIN KWASI BUAH-BLA",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed the appeal filed by Madam Linda Sagoe, Madam Victoria Allotey, and Benjamin Kwasi Buah-Blay against the Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT). The plaintiffs had claimed ownership of land plots in Dunkonaa, Accra, and sought damages for trespass, a declaration that SSNIT exceeded its allocated land by 43.30 acres, cancellation of SSNIT's Land Title Certificate on grounds of fraud, and a perpetual injunction. The High Court initially ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, but the Court of Appeal reversed the decision, holding that the plaintiffs failed to discharge the burden of proof regarding their title to the land. The Supreme Court affirmed this, emphasizing that the plaintiffs, aware of the state's compulsory acquisition of the land under EI 5 of 1993, had the obligation to prove their plots were outside the acquired area. However, they failed to provide credible evidence identifying their specific plots, making their claims unsustainable. The Court stressed that title to compulsorily acquired land cannot be challenged and that proof must meet the standard of preponderance of probabilities. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed, and the Court of Appeal’s judgment was upheld.",
