  "caseTitle": "MENSAH VERSUS S.C.O.A.",
  "summary": "In Mensah v. S.C.O.A. and Boahene, the plaintiff, as head of a family, sought a declaration of title to land in Aburi, Ghana, purchased by his two uncles and conveyed via an English-style deed. After one uncle's death, the survivor mortgaged the land to the first defendant (S.C.O.A.), who later sold it to the second defendant. The plaintiff argued the land was family property under customary law, with the uncles holding only life interests. The court held that despite the English form of conveyance, evidence of family involvement in developing the land displaced the presumption of English joint tenancy, establishing the property as family land governed by native customary law. Consequently, the mortgagor held only a life interest, which terminated at death, rendering the mortgage and subsequent sale invalid. The court granted the plaintiff a declaration of title and an injunction, emphasizing that purchasers must conduct public local inquiries to protect against undisclosed family interests.",
