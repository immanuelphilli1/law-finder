  "caseTitle": "CHRISTIAN VERSUS INTSIFUL.",
  "summary": "In Christian v. Intsiful, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council considered the validity of a will executed by a 93-year-old testator with impaired eyesight. The key issue was whether he had knowledge of the will's contents at execution, as required under Order 49, Rule 29 of the Courts Ordinance of the Gold Coast (now Ord. 60, r. 29 of the Supreme Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954), which mandates proof that a blind or illiterate testator either had the will read over or knew its contents. The will, though not read to the testator, contained detailed provisions reflecting intimate knowledge of his personal relationships and affairs, which could not have been known to an outsider. The Privy Council held that such detail on the face of the will was sufficient to imply the testator's knowledge of its contents, even without direct evidence of reading. It also clarified that 'blind' in the rule should be interpreted as functional inability to read, especially given its pairing with 'illiterate.' The appeal, challenging the West African Court of Appeal's upholding of probate, was dismissed.",
