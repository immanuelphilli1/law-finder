  "caseTitle": "BREMBA AMANKWA VERSUS MINISTER OF",
  "summary": "In Breman Asikuma, the applicant, elected Odikro of Barko, challenged the Governor-General's appointment of a committee of inquiry under the State Councils (Southern Ghana) Ordinance, c. 8 of 1952, arguing it was ultra vires as the matter had already been decided by the state council. The High Court, Eastern Judicial Division, held that appeal commissioners and inquiry committee members are public officers under the Interpretation Ordinance, and that the cause of action arose from the original proceedings before the state council in the Central Judicial Division. Thus, the application should have been filed in Cape Coast, not the Eastern Division, leading to dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. The court recommended transfer to the proper division.",
