  "caseTitle": "CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE VERSUS JENG.",
  "summary": "In Chief Superintendent of Police v. Jeng, a juvenile court in Bathurst, Gambia, found the appellant, a 14-year-old, guilty of stealing from the person and ordered his detention in the young persons' wing of H.M. Prisons for three years to be taught a trade. The Supreme Court of the Colony of Gambia upheld the conviction but quashed the sentence, ruling that the order amounted to imprisonment, which was illegal under the Children and Young Persons Ordinance, c. 20, as section 2 excludes prisons from the definition of 'place of detention.' The court held that while the juvenile could be imprisoned, a three-year term was excessive and inappropriate. Instead, the appellant was bound over in the sum of £5 to be of good behaviour for two years under the supervision of a probation officer, who was to report monthly to the court.",
