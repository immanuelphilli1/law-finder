  "caseTitle": "THE LAW'S RESPONSE TO SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHANGE IN GHANA [1991-9",
  "summary": "This legal analysis examines how Ghana's customary law, particularly regarding the accountability of pledgees in land and property pledges, has failed to keep pace with socio-economic transformations. Traditionally, pledgees were entitled to exploit pledged land without accounting for profits, a rule rooted in subsistence-level production and undeveloped land. However, with the rise of cash crops like cocoa and urban real estate, this principle leads to unjust enrichment. Cases such as Dapaah v Poku and Amoo v Adingun illustrate judicial tensions in applying outdated customs to modern economic realities. The article argues that the law must evolve to reflect current conditions, emphasizing that rigid adherence to non-accountability undermines equity and justice. It advocates for accountability mechanisms where profits from developed properties should offset debts, aligning customary law with contemporary economic practices.",
