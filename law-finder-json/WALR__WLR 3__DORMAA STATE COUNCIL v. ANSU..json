  "caseTitle": "DORMAA STATE COUNCIL VERSUS ANSU.",
  "summary": "The Dormaa State Council appealed to the Court of Appeal after the High Court, in its appellate jurisdiction, quashed a Magistrate's conviction of Ansu for failing to deliver stool property as ordered under the State Councils (Ashanti) Ordinance, 1952, s. 23(2). The Council relied on s. 338 of the Criminal Procedure Code, c. 10 of 1951, which allows appeals by 'any person aggrieved' from a High Court decision on appeal from a Magistrate’s Court. The Court of Appeal held that a prosecutor, including a private prosecutor like the State Council, is not a 'person aggrieved' within the meaning of the section. It overruled prior West African Court of Appeal decisions, notably Commissioner of Police v. Kwashie, finding they failed to consider binding English precedents. The appeal was dismissed at the threshold for lack of locus standi.",

    "A prosecutor is not a 'person aggrieved' under s. 338 of the Criminal Procedure Code.",
    "The phrase 'person aggrieved' must be interpreted in light of established English common law precedents.",
    "Legislative use of 'person aggrieved' implies adoption of its judicially settled meaning.",
    "The purpose of Part VIII of the Code is to benefit convicted persons, not prosecutors.",
    "The exclusion of 'severity of sentence' from appealable matters is irrelevant to prosecutors, supporting a restrictive interpretation.",
    "Prior local decisions allowing prosecutor appeals were overruled due to lack of engagement with authoritative English law.",
    "The Attorney-General, through amicus curiae, conceded that the Crown does not claim appeal rights as prosecutor.",
    "Private prosecutors are not in a better position than the Crown in this regard."
