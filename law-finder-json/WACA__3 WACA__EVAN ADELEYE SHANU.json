  "caseTitle": "EVAN ADELEYE SHANU",
  "summary": "This appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal concerned the interpretation of a Privy Council order regarding costs following the dismissal of an appeal by the surviving executor of an estate. The appellant, Evan Adeleye Shanu, challenged a lower court decision that held the costs awarded by the Privy Council should be paid from the estate of J.R. Shanu, deceased, rather than personally by the executor, P.H. Williams. The Court held that unless the Privy Council expressly orders costs to be paid from an estate, such liability remains personal, especially where a bond was entered into by the executors. The lower court's order was reversed, affirming that the executor was personally liable for the costs, and the appeal succeeded with costs awarded to the appellant.",
