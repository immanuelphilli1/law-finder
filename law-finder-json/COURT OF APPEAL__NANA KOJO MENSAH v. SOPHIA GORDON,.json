  "caseTitle": "KOJO MENSAH v. SOPHIA GORDON, CA. NO. 42",
  "summary": "In this civil appeal before the Court of Appeal of Ghana, the appellant, Nana Kojo Mensah, challenged the dismissal of his claim for a declaration of title to Ebionkessim and Abakan lands, and the erroneous award of judgment to a co-defendant, Bosom Kwesi, who had not filed any pleadings. The trial magistrate had dismissed the plaintiff's claim and the defendant's counter-claim, but granted the co-defendant a declaration of title and damages for trespass despite the absence of a formal counter-claim. The Court of Appeal found that the co-defendant's failure to file a Statement of Defence and counter-claim was fatal under Cap.4 of the Rules of Court. It held that the trial magistrate erred in law by granting relief to a party who did not plead for it and who did not prove the specific boundaries of the land claimed. The court also found a serious conflict of interest as Dr. Tackie-Otoo represented both the defendant and the co-defendant, whose claims were adverse. The court concluded that the plaintiff had established his authority to sue in a representative capacity on behalf of the Ebirashaen Ebiradze Stool Family and had proven the allodial title to the land. The judgment was therefore set aside, and judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff.",
