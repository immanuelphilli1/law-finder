  "summary": "This Court of Appeal decision in Speedline Stevedoring Co. Ltd. v. Gabriel Daniel (2004) addressed whether a company could sue former court-appointed receivers and managers for misappropriation of funds after their stewardship ended. The appellant, Gabriel Daniel, argued that under section 239 of the Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179), the plaintiff lacked capacity to sue as receivers were officers of the court, not the company. The Court dismissed the appeal, holding that while receivers act as officers of the court during their appointment and are accountable to it, this does not immunize them from tortious liability for misconduct such as conversion of company assets. The claim was not for breach of fiduciary duty as agents of the company but for independent tortious acts occurring during their management, which the company could pursue post-receivership. The Court affirmed that the constitutional rights of shareholders to seek redress for loss of corporate assets remain intact despite the temporary court control.",
