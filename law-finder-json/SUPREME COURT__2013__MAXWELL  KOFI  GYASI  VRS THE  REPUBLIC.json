  "caseTitle": "MAXWELL KOFI GYASI VRS THE REPUBLIC",
  "summary": "The applicant, Maxwell Kofi Gyasi, sought leave to adduce fresh evidence in an appeal against his conviction and 21-year sentence for robbery by the High Court, Kumasi. He claimed he was under 18 at the time of trial, making the proceedings and sentence invalid as they were conducted under adult criminal procedures. The applicant submitted a birth certificate and school admission records to support his age claim. However, the Supreme Court, per Anin Yeboah J.S.C., dismissed the application, holding that the evidence was available at trial and thus did not meet the legal criteria for fresh evidence. The Court emphasized the established principles from DOMBO & ORS. v. NARH [1970] CC 68 CA and reaffirmed in POKU v. POKU [2007-2008] SCGLR 996, which require that fresh evidence must be previously unavailable, relevant, credible, and capable of creating reasonable doubt. The Attorney-General’s Office did not appear or file a response. The Court found no grounds to depart from precedent and dismissed the application for lack of merit, aligning with the Court of Appeal’s earlier decision.",
