  "caseTitle": "CHAPMAN VERSUS OCLOO",
  "summary": "In Chapman v. Ocloo and Kporhanu, the plaintiff sued on behalf of his family to recover land, claiming ownership of family property. The defendants challenged the plaintiff's authority to sue in a representative capacity, which the plaintiff failed to establish through evidence. The High Court held that where a plaintiff sues on behalf of a family or stool and authority is contested, the burden lies on the plaintiff to prove such authority. The court emphasized that, absent exceptional circumstances, only the head of the family or someone with express family authorization may litigate on its behalf. The plaintiff’s failure to prove authority, coupled with evidence showing the property was jointly owned and partially alienated, led the court to overturn the Native Court’s judgment in his favor. The appeal was allowed, the judgment set aside, and the claim dismissed in favor of the defendants.",
