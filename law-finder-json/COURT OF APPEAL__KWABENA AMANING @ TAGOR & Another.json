  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC VERSUS KWABENA AMANING",
  "summary": "The Court of Appeal of Ghana unanimously quashed the convictions and sentences of the two appellants, Kwabena Amaning @ Tagor and Alhaji Issah Abbas, in a high-profile narcotics case. The court held that the charges under P.N.D.C. Law 236 were legally defective and failed to disclose recognizable offences. Despite assuming the authenticity of a key tape recording (Exhibit 'D'), the court found that the prosecution did not establish a prima facie case on any of the three counts—conspiracy or substantive prohibited business relating to narcotics. The trial court's decision to call the accused to defend was therefore erroneous. The judgment reaffirmed the fundamental principle that the prosecution must prove all elements of an offence beyond reasonable doubt, a burden that does not diminish even if the accused remains silent. Reliance on expert witnesses did not remedy the prosecution's failure to prove the statutory elements. The trial was declared a nullity based on binding precedents and constitutional principles, particularly Article 19(2)(c) and (10) of the 1992 Constitution.",
