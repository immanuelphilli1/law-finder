  "caseTitle": "REX V IVAN HUMPHREY DIXON",
  "summary": "The appellant, Ivan Humphrey Dixon, was convicted of larceny by a public servant in Port Loko, tried by the Circuit Court. He appealed, arguing that Port Loko, being part of the Colony of Sierra Leone, could only be tried by the Supreme Court, not the Circuit Court. The West Africa Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that the Protectorate Ordinance, 1933, validly extended Circuit Court jurisdiction to Port Loko by including it administratively within the Protectorate. The court ruled that the Legislative Council, unified for both Colony and Protectorate under the 1924 Order in Council, had the power to legislate for both territories. A technical breach of Article XV(3) of the Royal Instructions—requiring ordinance titles to reflect content—did not invalidate the law, as the body of the ordinance clearly defined its territorial scope. The court emphasized a long-standing legislative practice of treating outlying Colony areas like Port Loko as part of the Protectorate for judicial and administrative purposes.",
