  "summary": "This is a land dispute case heard by the Supreme Court of Ghana on appeal from a Court of Appeal judgment that reversed a High Court decision. The plaintiff, Saanbaye Basilde Kangberee, claimed ownership of a 0.15-hectare parcel of land in South Ofankor, registered under Land Title Certificate No. G.A. 17008, and sought declarations of title and trespass, recovery of possession, demolition of structures, and injunctive relief. The defendant, Alhaji Seidu Mohamed, counterclaimed ownership based on a purchase from Mr. and Mrs. Marcus and alleged the plaintiff’s land fell within a road reservation. The High Court initially ruled for the defendant, relying partly on the surveyor C.W.1’s testimony that the plaintiff’s land was in a road and did not match the occupied plot. However, the Court of Appeal reversed this, finding C.W.1’s evidence unreliable and incoherent, and upheld the plaintiff’s title. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeal’s decision, holding that the plaintiff’s registered title was prima facie proof of ownership, the defendant failed to prove superior title, and the surveyor’s testimony was too inconsistent to rely upon. The appeal was dismissed, and the plaintiff’s claims were upheld.",
