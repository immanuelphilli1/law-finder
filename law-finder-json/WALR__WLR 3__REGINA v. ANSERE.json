  "caseTitle": "REGINA VERSUS ANSERE",
  "summary": "The appellant, Ansere, treasurer of the Kibi Local Council, was convicted of stealing under s 288(1) of the Criminal Code after a cash shortage of £656 2s. 10d. was discovered during an audit. The defence argued that revenue collection and bookkeeping were handled by his assistant, Sasu, who retained some funds not yet handed over. Sasu’s police statement confirmed he held £69 14s. 8d. and claimed to have handed it to Ansere during the audit—a claim denied by officials. The prosecution did not call Sasu as a witness. The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred by rejecting the defence solely based on disbelief without considering its reasonableness. It emphasized that actual possession is required for conviction, which was negated by the delegation of duties known to the employer. Furthermore, the failure to call Sasu, a material witness who could have resolved the case, meant the prosecution failed to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The conviction was quashed.",
