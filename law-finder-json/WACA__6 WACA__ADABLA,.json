  "summary": "This 1940 West Africa Court of Appeal decision arose from a land boundary dispute between members of the Anyigbe Tribe and defendants from Frevieh and Avegomeh. The case originated in the Native Tribunal of Ada, which non-suited the plaintiff. The Provincial Commissioner's Court reversed that decision after taking additional evidence, including a survey and site view. On initial appeal, the West Africa Court of Appeal set aside the Provincial Commissioner's judgment due to non-compliance with s 77(1) of the Native Administration Ordinance. The Privy Council remitted the case, holding the Court had discretion to hear the appeal. Upon rehearing, the Court confirmed jurisdiction, found the Native Tribunal trial unfair due to unconsidered viewer reports, and criticized the Provincial Commissioner for overruling factual findings based on partially heard evidence. The appeal was allowed, the lower court judgments were set aside, and the case was remitted for a de novo hearing before the Native Tribunal. The Court also disapproved of the practice of one person testifying under another's name, citing perjury risks.",
