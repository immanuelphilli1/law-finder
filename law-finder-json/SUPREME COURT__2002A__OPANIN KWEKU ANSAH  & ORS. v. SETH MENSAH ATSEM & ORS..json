  "summary": "In this 2002 ruling, the Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an application by Opanin Kwaku Ansa and others for special leave to appeal a 1998 Court of Appeal judgment that had overturned a Circuit Court decision in their favor. The plaintiffs had sued for trespass and injunctive relief over land known as Bortogina, which they claimed ownership to by ancestral purchase and prior judicial recognition. Although the Circuit Court ruled for them in 1995, the Court of Appeal reversed the decision, citing the plaintiffs' failure to clearly identify the disputed land. The plaintiffs' attempt to appeal to the Supreme Court was initially flawed due to failure to obtain prior leave from the Court of Appeal, and subsequent delays led to withdrawal of the appeal. Their later application for special leave under Article 131(2) of the Constitution was denied due to inordinate delay of nearly four years and lack of demonstration of a substantial legal issue or public interest. The Court emphasized that counsel's errors do not excuse procedural non-compliance and that finality in litigation must be upheld.",
