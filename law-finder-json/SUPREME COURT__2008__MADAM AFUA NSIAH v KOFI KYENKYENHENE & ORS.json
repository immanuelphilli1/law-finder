  "summary": "This is a civil property dispute before the Supreme Court of Ghana concerning House No. AM.9 in Ampabame, Kumasi. The plaintiff, Madam Afua Nsiah, claimed to be the head of her maternal family and sued to declare the house family property devised by her granduncle, Kwabena Asante. She sought recovery of possession and a perpetual injunction. The High Court granted her claims, but the Court of Appeal reversed, citing lack of capacity and insufficient evidence. The Supreme Court upheld the reversal, finding that the plaintiff failed to prove her capacity to sue on behalf of the family. Key witness PW1 (over 100 years old) claimed the house belonged to her, not the plaintiff, undermining the plaintiff's standing. The evidence on compensation payments and funding of the house was inconsistent and largely hearsay. The trial judge improperly amended the plaintiff's capacity under Order 28 r12 without sufficient basis. The Supreme Court affirmed that without proof of authority or representation, the plaintiff could not maintain the suit, especially when the true owner (PW1) made an adverse claim. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the Court of Appeal's judgment.",
