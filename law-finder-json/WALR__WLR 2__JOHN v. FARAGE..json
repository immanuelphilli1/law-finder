  "caseTitle": "JOHN VERSUS FARAGE.",
  "summary": "In John v. Farage, an action for damages for breach of an implied warranty of fitness in a contract of hire, the plaintiff hired a lorry from the defendant for three months starting December 2, 1955. The plaintiff returned the lorry after seven days, claiming it was defective and unsuitable for use due to repeated breakdowns. The court held that in a contract of hire, the bailor has an implied obligation to ensure the chattel is reasonably fit for its intended purpose, constituting an implied warranty. However, the plaintiff failed to prove the lorry was unfit, as his evidence was vague and unsupported. The mechanic testified only to faulty headlight bulbs, a minor issue. Crucially, the lorry was subsequently hired to a third party and operated without incident for four months, with no evidence of repairs. Thus, the plaintiff's claim failed, and judgment was entered for the defendant with costs.",
