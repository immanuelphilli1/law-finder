  "caseTitle": "OF THE COURT OF APPEAL VERSUS KOFI ASIAMAH SAMPONG",
  "summary": "This appeal concerned the refusal of the Circuit Court, Mpraeso, to grant an interlocutory injunction to restrain the defendant from constructing on land claimed by the plaintiff. The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge, while correctly articulating the legal test from American Cyanamid v. Ethicon Ltd., misapplied it by failing to recognize that the plaintiff, who had prior possession, faced irreparable injury due to the alteration of the land's character through construction. The defendant's potential financial loss from delayed building could be compensated by damages, whereas the plaintiff's loss could not. The appellate court emphasized the equitable power under Order 50 rule 7(2) to impose conditions, such as an undertaking for damages, to balance the parties' interests. Consequently, the appeal was allowed, and an injunction was granted to restrain the defendant from further construction pending final determination of the title dispute.",
