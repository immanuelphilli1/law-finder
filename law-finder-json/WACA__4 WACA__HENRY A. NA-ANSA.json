  "caseTitle": "HENRY A. NA-ANSA",
  "summary": "This appeal from the West Africa Court of Appeal arose from consolidated civil actions between Henry A. Na-Ansa and Tettey Kudsu concerning trespass to land and boundary disputes following an execution sale. The trial was conducted without pleadings, leading to procedural irregularities. The trial judge found that Na-Ansa lawfully purchased land described in a certificate of purchase and was entitled to damages for trespass by Kudsu, awarding £200. However, the appellate court found the trial unsatisfactory due to lack of pleadings, improper admission and rejection of survey plans, and a material mid-trial shift in Kudsu's case. The joinder of seven additional defendants in the cross-action was upheld as precautionary. The appellate court set aside the damages award that exceeded the pleaded claim and ordered a re-trial with proper pleadings to ensure clarity and fairness.",
