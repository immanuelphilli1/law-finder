  "caseTitle": "COMMISSIONER OF POLICE VERSUS SAGNIA.",
  "summary": "The appellant was convicted in the Bathurst Magistrate's Court of breaking and entering a dwelling-house and stealing. Although the charge sheet erroneously cited section 283 of the Criminal Code instead of section 281(1), the Supreme Court of the Colony of the Gambia held that the accused was clearly informed of the true nature of the charge, and thus no failure of justice occurred. Under section 290(1)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the court altered the conviction to housebreaking and stealing under sections 281(1) and 252 of the Criminal Code. The appellant’s inconsistent statements to police and in court were noted, and the 12-month sentence with hard labour was upheld due to prior convictions for theft. The appeal was dismissed.",
