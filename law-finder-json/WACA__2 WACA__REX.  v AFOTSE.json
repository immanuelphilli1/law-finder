  "caseTitle": "REX. v AFOTSE",
  "summary": "In Rex v Afotse (1934), the West African Court of Appeal affirmed the trial judge's ruling that a statement made by one accused and read to others by a police inspector was inadmissible against the other accused due to non-compliance with Rule 8 of the Judges' Rules. The court emphasized that the rule, designed to prevent entrapment and ensure fair procedure, requires that co-accused be given copies of statements without police prompting. Recognizing widespread illiteracy, the court added a proviso allowing statements to be read or interpreted by a non-police officer. Any remarks made during such reading are inadmissible, but a cautioned reply may be taken if the accused wishes to respond.",
