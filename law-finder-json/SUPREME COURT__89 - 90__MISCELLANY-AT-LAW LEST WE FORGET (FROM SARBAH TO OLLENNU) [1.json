  "caseTitle": "MISCELLANY-AT-LAW LEST WE FORGET (FROM SARBAH TO OLLENNU) [1",
  "summary": "This reflective legal commentary traces the legacy of Ghanaian legal luminaries from John Mensah Sarbah to Nii Amaa Ollennu, emphasizing their roles as jurists, nationalists, and patriots. It highlights Sarbah's foundational work in customary law, his opposition to the 1897 Lands Bill, and the formation of the Aborigines' Rights Protection Society. The piece underscores the historical role of lawyers in defending human rights and the rule of law, citing figures like J.E. Casely Hayford, Dr. J.B. Danquah, and Kwamena Bentsi-Enchill. It critiques contemporary perceptions of lawyers while affirming their societal contributions beyond litigation, including education, publishing, and nation-building. The narrative serves as a reminder of the ethical and public service dimensions of the legal profession in Ghana.",
