  "caseTitle": "ABABIO AND OTHERS, VERSUS DARKWA AND OTHERS.",
  "summary": "In ABABIO AND OTHERS v. DARKWA AND OTHERS, the plaintiffs claimed title to forest land allegedly purchased in 1913 from the Akanteng Stool, supported by a 1927 deed of conveyance executed by the Odikro of Akanteng and the Omanhene of Akyem Abuakwa as consenting party. However, they failed to prove customary requirements such as public demarcation of boundaries necessary for a valid land sale under native law. The defendants, in possession as tenants of the Asamankese Stool, argued the Akanteng Stool lacked authority to convey the land and the Omanhene had no power to confirm such a transaction. The court upheld that the Akanteng Stool was subordinate to Asamankese, which in turn owed allegiance to Akyem Abuakwa as the paramount authority. Since the plaintiffs could not establish compliance with customary procedures for land transfer, their claim failed. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the necessity of adhering to customary law in stool land transactions.",
