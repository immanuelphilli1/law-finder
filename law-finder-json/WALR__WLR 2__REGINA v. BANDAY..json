  "summary": "In Regina v. Banday, the accused was convicted of murder for stabbing his brother during a disturbance while allegedly intoxicated. The facts showed that after drinking, the accused attacked a third party, was restrained by his brother, and then stabbed him from behind with a penknife, causing fatal injuries. The defense argued that the accused was too intoxicated to form the necessary intent for murder. The court held that while intoxication may be considered in assessing intent under section 11(4) of the Criminal Code, it does not negate malice aforethought where the accused knew their actions would probably cause death or grievous harm, even if indifferent to the outcome—per section 190(b). The judge found the accused had exaggerated his level of intoxication, noting he gave a coherent account of events shortly after the incident and showed awareness and distress. Therefore, malice aforethought was established, and the conviction for murder under section 187 stood.",

    "Section 11(4) of the Criminal Code only applies where intent is an essential element; it does not assist where liability is based on knowledge and recklessness.",
