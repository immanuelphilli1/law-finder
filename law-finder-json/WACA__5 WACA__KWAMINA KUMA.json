  "caseTitle": "KWAMINA KUMA",
  "summary": "This 1938 Privy Council appeal originated from a land dispute in the Gold Coast Colony (now Ghana) between Kwamina Kuma, the Odikro of Abrobonku, and Kofi Kuma, a farmer from Yowuma village. The case centered on a declaration of title to a portion of land known as Otenkyiren, surrounded by a red boundary on a survey plan. The trial judge, Mr. Justice Strother-Stewart, granted the declaration in favor of Kwamina Kuma, but the West African Court of Appeal reversed this decision, ordering a nonsuit. The Privy Council, upon review, found that the plaintiff's evidence—based on traditional history, proximity of stool lands, and the practice of non-extraction of tribute—was sufficient to support his title. It emphasized that long occupation without tribute does not negate native communal land ownership principles, citing Amodu Tijani v. The Secretary, Southern Nigeria. The Council set aside the Court of Appeal’s judgment and restored the trial court’s decision, affirming the plaintiff’s title over the disputed land.",
