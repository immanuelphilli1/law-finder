  "caseTitle": "AMODU RUFAI",
  "summary": "In this civil land dispute before the West Africa Court of Appeal, the plaintiff, representing the Saogun family, sought a declaration of title to a parcel of land at Pakodo Ikorodu Beach, claiming descent from Saogun deceased. The claim relied on prior judgments and familial lineage but failed to establish how Saogun originally acquired the land or define the boundaries of Ipakodo. The defendants contested the identity of the land, asserting it was Ebute Ile Eletu, and argued the cited judgments were not binding. The trial judge dismissed the claim due to insufficient evidence, a decision upheld on appeal. The appellate court found no definitive evidence linking the disputed promontory to Ipakodo land, noting that the referenced judgments and skeletal Plan 'A' provided no clear boundary or adjacency. The court emphasized that the burden of proof rested on the plaintiff, who failed to meet it, and dismissed the appeal with costs, modifying the lower court's judgment to remove an extraneous finding on ownership of the promontory.",
