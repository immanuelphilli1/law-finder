  "summary": "This Court of Appeal case in Ghana involved Prudential Bank Ltd. appealing against a summary judgment granted in its favor by the High Court against Telecity Company Ltd. and another defendant. The core dispute centered on two debts: one in US Dollars ($60,149.91) and another in Ghana Cedis (¢49,857,467). The appellant argued that the summary judgment was improperly granted because triable issues existed. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal in part. It held that the summary judgment on the Dollar debt was inappropriate because the appellant presented evidence (Exhibit 3) showing full payment, and the bank's unilateral conversion of a USD deposit into Cedis at its own exchange rate to offset the Cedi debt raised genuine triable issues regarding set-off, mandate, and exchange rates. However, the appeal failed regarding the Cedi debt. The appellant's defense—that it should not pay because a bank official demanded a personal loan of ¢40 million—was dismissed as implausible and potentially based on an illegal bribe. The court applied the principle *ex turpi causa non oritur actio*, refusing to allow a party to benefit from its own wrongdoing. The case was remitted for trial on the Dollar claim, while the summary judgment on the Cedi debt was upheld.",
