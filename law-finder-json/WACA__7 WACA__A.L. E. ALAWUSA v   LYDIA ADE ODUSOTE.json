  "caseTitle": "A.L. E. ALAWUSA v LYDIA ADE ODUSOTE",
  "summary": "This appeal arose from a conviction for indecent assault under section 360 of the Criminal Code, following a magistrate's trial where the appellant, A.L.E. Alawusa, was found guilty of shaving the pubic hair of his wife, Lydia Ade Odusote, married under native law and custom. The High Court upheld the conviction but corrected a clerical error in the charge. On further appeal to the West African Court of Appeal, the court held that while the act constituted an assault, it could not properly be characterised as indecent due to the marital relationship. The court rejected the argument that a husband cannot commit indecent assault on his wife by analogy to marital rape, but emphasized that cultural context and the nature of spousal relations affected the characterization. Consequently, the conviction for indecent assault was set aside and a verdict of common assault under section 351 of the Criminal Code was substituted, with a sentence of six weeks' imprisonment with hard labour imposed.",
