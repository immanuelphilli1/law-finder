  "caseTitle": "REX v SAMUEL OLUKOY A EWETUGA",
  "summary": "The appellants, Samuel Olukoya Ewetuga and Fasasi Alli, were charged with multiple counts of fraudulent false accounting under s. 438(b) of the Criminal Code and stealing under s. 390, relating to petrol allocations in Ijebu Ode. During trial, the prosecution amended six counts from alleging 'making a false entry' to 'omitting an entry' in log books, reclassifying them under s. 438(c). The West Africa Court of Appeal held that these amendments altered the substance of the charges rather than correcting a defect, prejudicing the appellants and violating s. 92(2) of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance. Relying on R. v. Hughes, the court quashed the convictions on counts 1, 7, and 11 for fraudulent false accounting. The court further found the stealing convictions on counts 3, 8, and 12 unsafe due to the trial judge's failure to record reasons or findings of fact, rendering them unsustainable. The appeal was allowed, and all convictions were set aside.",
