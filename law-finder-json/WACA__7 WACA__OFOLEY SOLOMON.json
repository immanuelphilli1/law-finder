  "caseTitle": "OFOLEY SOLOMON",
  "summary": "This case involved a dispute over whether properties devised under the will of William Adjabeng Solomon were self-acquired or family property. The plaintiff, Ofoley Solomon, as head of the Nee Adjabeng Ankrah family, initially filed in the Divisional Court, which declined jurisdiction, referring the matter to the Ga Manche Tribunal. That tribunal ruled the properties were family assets and confirmed Emmanuel Obeng Ankrah as family head. Subsequently, the Divisional Court ordered payment of funds collected by a court-appointed receiver to the family head. An executor appealed, arguing the Divisional Court lacked jurisdiction after referral. The West African Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that the Divisional Court retained authority to make consequential orders under its inherent powers, citing Fritz v. Hobson, and affirming that non-final orders carry an implied liberty to apply for further relief.",
