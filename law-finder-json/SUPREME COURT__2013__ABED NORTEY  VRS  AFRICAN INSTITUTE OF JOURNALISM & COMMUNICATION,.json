  "summary": "In this 2013 Supreme Court of Ghana ruling, Abed Nortey applied for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the defendants from dealing with land pending appeal. The court, per Justice A. A. Benin sitting singly, dismissed the application as incompetent because the Supreme Court had not yet been seized with the appeal—since the record of appeal had not been transmitted—making it improper to file directly in the Supreme Court under Rule 16(1) of C.I. 16. The court held that such applications must first be made to the lower court under Rule 20(2). The ruling was later overturned on May 17, 2013, by a full bench comprising Justices G. T. Wood (Mrs), Anin Yeboah, and J. B. Akamba, following a review application filed on April 23, 2013.",
