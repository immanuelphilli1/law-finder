  "caseTitle": "SAMUEL KWASI NTIRI NARKO KONKAI TAWIAH v GBAWE MANTSE ADAM",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case, decided on 18th October 2006, arose from a land dispute over a parcel at Chuim, Odorkor, involving claims of title, trespass, and possession. The plaintiff, Samuel Kwasi Ntiri, claimed ownership via a 1977 conveyance from the Asere Mantse, while the defendants, Gbawe Mantse and Adam Kwatei Quartey, asserted the land was part of Gbawe family land and raised estoppel based on a prior 1961 High Court judgment. The trial court granted the plaintiff’s claims, but the Court of Appeal partially allowed the defendants’ appeal, criticizing the trial judge for relying on an ineffective court-appointed surveyor and improperly delegating judicial functions by ordering post-judgment surveying. The Supreme Court ultimately reviewed whether the trial court’s actions constituted a miscarriage of justice, particularly regarding procedural irregularities and failure to address estoppel. The case underscores the importance of proper evidence, judicial oversight in land surveys, and the binding effect of prior judgments in customary land disputes.",
