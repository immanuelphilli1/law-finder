  "caseTitle": "LT. COL. S. B. ASHUN v ACCRA BREWERY LTD.",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed the appeal by Lt. Col. S. B. Ashun against Accra Brewery Ltd., holding that his acceptance of a severance package after being declared redundant constituted a valid compromise agreement, extinguishing any claim for wrongful termination. The Court clarified that a contract of employment does not guarantee tenure until retirement and that damages for wrongful termination are limited to a reasonable period for finding new employment, subject to mitigation. It rejected the argument that paragraphs 34 and 35 of the Labour (Amendment) Decree 1969, NLCD 342 imposed a duty to negotiate severance in redundancy cases, noting those provisions apply only to organizational closure or amalgamation. With no statutory or express contractual redundancy clause, the severance payment was deemed based on implied terms. The Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s reversal of the trial court’s judgment, finding no unlawful or wrongful termination due to mutual agreement via acceptance of the package.",
