  "caseTitle": "BURDEN OF PROOF IN LAND SUITS [1989-90] VOL. XVII RGL 349—35",
  "summary": "This legal analysis examines the burden of proof in civil land title disputes in Ghana, focusing on the 1989 Court of Appeal decision in Banga v Djanie. The commentary questions whether a higher standard of proof—akin to criminal 'beyond reasonable doubt'—applies in land cases, as suggested by Francois JSC. It argues that under the Evidence Decree, 1975 (NRCD 323), the standard remains 'preponderance of probabilities' for all civil cases, including land suits. The Kodilinye principle, requiring plaintiffs to win on the strength of their own case, is clarified: it applies only when the plaintiff fails entirely to make a case, not when the defence merely has weaknesses. The Supreme Court in Odametey v Clocuh and the Court of Appeal in Ricketts v Addo emphasized that if a plaintiff presents even a weak but demonstrable case, they may rely on gaps or weaknesses in the defence. The article concludes that the 'higher burden' notion lacks statutory support and risks undermining fair adjudication.",

  "verdict": "In Banga v Djanie, the Court of Appeal allowed the defendants' appeal, holding that the plaintiff failed to prove her title on the strength of her own case. However, the broader legal question of a 'higher burden' in land cases remains contested, with authoritative decisions supporting the standard civil burden of proof on a balance of probabilities.",
