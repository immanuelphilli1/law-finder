  "caseTitle": "BAIDEN & ORS v GRAPHIC CORPORATION",
  "summary": "In James Baiden & Ors v Graphic Corporation, the Court of Appeal reviewed a High Court decision that had ordered the Graphic Corporation to compute end-of-service benefits for former employees under Section 28(4) of a Collective Bargaining Agreement. The plaintiffs, former employees, claimed wrongful termination and non-payment of entitlements, including provident fund contributions and severance awards. The High Court had ruled in their favor, declaring the freezing of benefits unlawful. On appeal, the Court held that the freezing of End of Service Benefits (E.S.B.) by the P.N.D.C. Government in 1990 was an executive act protected under Section 34(5) of the Transitional Provisions of the 1992 Constitution, which barred judicial review of such state actions. The appellate court found that the trial judge erred by not recognizing this constitutional ouster clause, despite correctly identifying a breach of the collective agreement. The appeal was allowed on this ground, and the order compelling payment under the severance provisions was set aside. The court affirmed that while the policy may have been unfavorable to workers, it was within the government's authority and immune from judicial challenge.",
