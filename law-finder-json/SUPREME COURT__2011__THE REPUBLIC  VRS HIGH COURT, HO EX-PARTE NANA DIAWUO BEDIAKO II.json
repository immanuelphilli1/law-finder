  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC VRS HIGH COURT, HO EX-PARTE NANA DIAWUO BEDIAKO II",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an application by Nana Diawuo Bediako II, Omanhene of Pai Traditional Area, and Nana Adomako Mensah, Stool Father, who sought certiorari and prohibition to quash bail and related proceedings granted by the High Court, Ho, in a criminal case originally tried at the Circuit Court, Hohoe. The applicants argued that the High Court, Ho lacked jurisdiction as the case originated in Hohoe and no transfer order was issued by the Chief Justice. The Supreme Court held that although appeals and related applications should generally be filed at the High Court, Hohoe, the non-functioning status of that court at the time justified the filing at Ho. The Court also affirmed that applicants had locus standi under the public interest exception established in Republic v Korle Gonno District Magistrate Ex-parte Ampomah and In re-Appenteng, dismissing the preliminary objection. It ruled that the High Court, Ho had jurisdiction to hear the bail application due to operational constraints in Hohoe and that the applicants' request for certiorari and prohibition lacked merit.",
