  "caseTitle": "KWABENA N. RIVERSON & ORS v. YAW SIAW ADDO",
  "summary": "This Court of Appeal case arose from a land dispute between the administrators of Opanin Yaw Koranteng's estate (plaintiffs/appellants) and Yaw Siaw Addo (defendant/respondent). The plaintiffs sought a declaration of title, accounting of rents, injunction, and recovery of possession of stores at Agona Swedru. The High Court dismissed their claim, favoring the defendant's assertion that his father, Kwame Addo, purchased the land and gifted it to him. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, finding that the trial judge misdirected himself on the burden of proof, incorrectly requiring the plaintiffs to prove title beyond reasonable doubt instead of by a preponderance of probabilities as mandated by the Evidence Decree NRCD 323. The appellate court emphasized the legal weight of the Deed of Assignment (Exhibit B) in the name of Yaw Koranteng and Kwame Addo's affidavit confirming the transfer, rejecting the trial judge's unsupported inference of a deceptive name change. The judgment underscores that documentary evidence and correct legal principles must govern land title disputes.",
