  "caseTitle": "SAROBI LIMITED v. N.P.T. KUPUALOR",
  "summary": "This Court of Appeal decision from 2004 concerns an internal dispute within the Association of Building and Civil Contractors of Ghana (ABCCG). The plaintiff, Sarobi Limited, sought a declaration that the defendant, N.P.T. Kupualor, had overstayed his four-year term as National President, which expired on January 14, 2000, following his 1996 election. The plaintiff also sought ancillary reliefs including the appointment of an interim management committee, external auditors, and an election under the National Electoral Commission. The defendant challenged the suit's validity on grounds of non-compliance with the association’s arbitration clause under Article 37, arguing the matter was premature. However, the trial court dismissed the defendant’s motion to set aside the writ due to his unconditional appearance, which barred such a procedural challenge. The court then granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant appealed on multiple grounds, but the appeal was ultimately dismissed due to procedural irregularities, including failure to properly file submissions and lack of engagement by counsel, rendering the appeal nebulous.",
