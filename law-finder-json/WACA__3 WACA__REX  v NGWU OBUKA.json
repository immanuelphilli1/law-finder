  "caseTitle": "REX v NGWU OBUKA",
  "summary": "The appellant, Ngwu Obuka, was convicted by the High Court on a second count of child stealing under section 371(1) and (2) of the Criminal Code, while being acquitted on the first count of slave dealing under section 369(2). The prosecution's evidence, if accepted, would have supported only the first count. On appeal, the Crown did not defend the conviction on child stealing and instead requested the appellate court to substitute a guilty verdict under section 365 of the Criminal Code, which the court declined, holding that it could only do so if the trial judge must have been satisfied of facts proving guilt for that offence. As this threshold was not met, the appeal was allowed, the conviction quashed, and the appellant discharged.",
