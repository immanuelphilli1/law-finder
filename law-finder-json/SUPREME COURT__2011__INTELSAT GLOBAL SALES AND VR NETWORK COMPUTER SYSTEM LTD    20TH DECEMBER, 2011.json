  "summary": "This Supreme Court ruling addresses the jurisdictional validity of an appeal from a High Court decision refusing to set aside the registration of a foreign judgment. The central issue was whether the appeal, filed beyond the 21-day limit, was a nullity due to the interlocutory nature of the order. The court held that if an order is a nullity—particularly for violating Section 17 of the Bodies Corporate (Official Liquidation) Act, 1963 (Act 180)—the lapse of time does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to review it. Relying on the foundational principle from Mosi v. Bagyina, the court reaffirmed that a judgment void ab initio remains void indefinitely and may be set aside at any time. The ruling underscores that jurisdictional defects cannot be cured by procedural timelines, and such void orders are unenforceable regardless of when they are challenged.",
