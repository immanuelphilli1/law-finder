  "caseTitle": "KOGLEX LIMITED v. MRS. KATE FIELD",
  "summary": "In Koglex Limited v. Mrs. Kate Field, the Supreme Court of Ghana considered an application for review of its earlier 3:2 majority decision affirming the dismissal of a claim for specific performance of an unexecuted lease agreement. The applicant alleged a fundamental error resulting in a miscarriage of justice, arguing that the majority failed to properly evaluate whether the lower courts' findings were supported by evidence. The court emphasized that a second appellate court must independently assess whether concurrent findings of lower courts are justified by the record, particularly where findings are based on established facts rather than witness demeanor. The case centered on whether an agreement had been sufficiently concluded after negotiations on 14th September 1985, following partial payment of a five-year rent advance (GHC 200,000). The plaintiff had commenced work on the property, but the defendant repudiated the deal without refunding the advance. The trial and appellate courts found no concluded contract due to unresolved terms, but the Supreme Court’s review panel scrutinized whether this amounted to a fundamental error. The court reaffirmed principles from authorities like Ollennu J.A. in Kyiafi v. Wono and Achoro v. Ankepfela, holding that appellate courts must intervene when findings are unsupported by evidence, based on wrong legal principles, or inconsistent with documentary evidence. Ultimately, the review application was determined based on whether such fundamental error occurred, particularly in light of exhibits and correspondence showing apparent agreement.",
