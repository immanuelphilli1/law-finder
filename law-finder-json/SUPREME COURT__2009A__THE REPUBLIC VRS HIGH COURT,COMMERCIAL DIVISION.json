  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC VRS HIGH COURT,COMMERCIAL DIVISION",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an application by Double Crown Investment Ltd. to quash a High Court order varying a payment-by-installment arrangement. The original order, granted by Justice Kwofie as a vacation judge, allowed the debtor to pay a judgment debt in installments with a default clause. The creditor, Granada Hotel Ltd., found the order ambiguous and, after a review application was struck out due to Order 42 Rule 4 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 2004 (C.I. 47), filed a variation application before Justice Tanko Amadu. The Supreme Court held that Justice Amadu had jurisdiction to hear the variation, as no appeal was pending and the application was not a prohibited review. The court found that the variation did not exceed jurisdiction, as the core payment terms were affirmed and only the execution mechanism was clarified. The application was dismissed.",

  "rationaleHighlights": [
    "The Supreme Court held that Justice Tanko Amadu did not lack jurisdiction to vary the installment order, as no appeal was pending and the application was not a review under Order 42 Rule 4.",
    "The variation sought by the creditor was for clarity and did not improperly alter the original order; the judge affirmed the payment terms but refused to allow execution without court leave.",
    "The court distinguished RE GM HOLDINGS and GHANA NATIONAL TRADING CORPORATION, finding them inapplicable due to the absence of a pending appeal.",
    "A judgment creditor may seek variation or clarification of an ambiguous order, analogous to a debtor's right to seek favorable terms."
  ],
  "confidenceNotes": "The ruling is clear and well-reasoned, with direct references to applicable rules and precedents. Jurisdictional analysis is thorough.",
