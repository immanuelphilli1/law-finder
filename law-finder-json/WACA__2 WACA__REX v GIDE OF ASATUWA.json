  "caseTitle": "REX v GIDE OF ASATUWA",
  "summary": "This is an appeal from a High Court decision in a civil land dispute where the appellant, Gide of Asatuwa, Head Chief and Eze of Obosi, sought a declaration of title to a parcel of land in Onitsha Province. The trial judge, Mr. Justice Graham Paul, found the evidence from both parties conflicting and inconclusive, particularly regarding traditional ownership stories and occupation. He ruled in favor of the defendant, representing the Onitshas. On appeal, the West Africa Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that the plaintiff failed to discharge the burden of proof required for a declaration of title. The court emphasized that such a judgment does not confer title on the defendant but merely denies the plaintiff's claim. The appellate court found no misdirection in law, upheld the trial judge's discretion in evaluating witness credibility, and rejected arguments for non-suit under Order 39 Rule 1. It also held that an earlier obiter comment questioning the bona fides of the claim did not compromise judicial impartiality, especially since no objection was raised when the same judge resumed the case. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
