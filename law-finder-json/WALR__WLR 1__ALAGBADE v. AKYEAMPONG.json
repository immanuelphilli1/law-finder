  "caseTitle": "ALAGBADE VERSUS AKYEAMPONG",
  "summary": "The plaintiff, a licensed moneylender, sued to recover ₤606 Os. 3d as the balance due under two loan agreements secured by cocoa farms. The agreements stated loans of ₤500 + ₤50 interest and ₤184 + ₤10 interest, with repayment via cocoa proceeds. The defendant contested, asserting the true loans were ₤300 + ₤250 interest and ₤100 + ₤94 interest, and that the documents misrepresented the terms. The court found the plaintiff's evidence unconvincing and credited the defendant's account. It held the agreements void under s.26(2) of the Moneylenders Ordinance for misstating loan terms, the second agreement unenforceable under s.12(1) for failure to deliver a copy, and the interest rates excessive under s.13(1) and s.3 of the Loans Recovery Ordinance. The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs awarded to the defendant.",
