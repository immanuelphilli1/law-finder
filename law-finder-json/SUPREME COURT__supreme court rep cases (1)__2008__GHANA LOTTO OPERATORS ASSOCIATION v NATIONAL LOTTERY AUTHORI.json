  "summary": "In Ghana Lotto Operators Association v National Lottery Authority, the Supreme Court of Ghana addressed a constitutional reference on whether the National Lotto Act, 2006 (Act 722) violated Articles 33(5), 35(1), and 36(2)(b) of the 1992 Constitution. The plaintiffs, private lotto operators, challenged the Act's monopoly provisions and a directive to surrender lottery equipment, arguing infringements on economic freedom and private sector rights. The Court held that Article 33(5), which recognizes unenumerated democratic rights, was not violated, as the plaintiffs failed to clearly identify such rights or demonstrate their applicability. Article 35(1), concerning national sovereignty, was deemed too general to be infringed by the Act. Regarding Article 36(2)(b), which promotes private sector participation, the Court found it non-justiciable, distinguishing Ghana’s Constitution from India’s, where directive principles are explicitly non-enforceable. Despite the absence of an express non-justiciability clause, the Court interpreted Chapter 6 as aspirational and not directly enforceable in courts, thus upholding Act 722. The ruling clarified the limits of constitutional enforcement of economic policy directives in Ghana.",
