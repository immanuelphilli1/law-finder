  "caseTitle": "Gladys Anane Addo & 9 v Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly , Kejet",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an appeal by the Kejetia Traders Association against a lower court order requiring it to render accounts for funds collected from members for the reconstruction of market stalls in Kejetia, Kumasi. The original plaintiffs, former licensees and members of the association, contributed money to pre-finance the project but were dissatisfied with the allocation of new stalls and lack of financial transparency. The High Court had ordered the association's executives to account for the funds, with auditing by the Serious Fraud Office, a decision upheld by the Court of Appeal and later affirmed by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court held that the High Court judge acted within his powers under Order 33 Rule 3 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, despite not ordering accounts earlier in the process, and found no miscarriage of justice. The court emphasized the duty of accountability given the large sums collected and poor record-keeping by the association.",
