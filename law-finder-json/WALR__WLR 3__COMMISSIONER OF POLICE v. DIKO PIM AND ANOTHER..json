  "caseTitle": "COMMISSIONER OF POLICE VERSUS DIKO PIM",
  "summary": "The High Court of the Ashanti Judicial Division in Ghana considered whether the Ejisu Stool Property (No.2) Order, 1958, made under the Statute Law Amendment (No.2) Act, 1957, had legal force before its publication in the Gazette. The order, dated September 12, 1958, but published on September 20, authorized Nana Kofi Atta to seize stool property and eject occupants. Diko Pim and another were charged with obstructing this action on September 12. The Magistrate discharged them, ruling the order unenforceable before publication. The Attorney-General referred the case to the Supreme Court via case stated. The court held that the order constituted subsidiary legislation with legislative effect, not a mere executive act, and thus required publication in the Gazette to have legal force under the Interpretation Act, 1957. It further ruled that no offence was created by breaching the order, as the statute did not criminalize such conduct directly. Therefore, the appeal was dismissed.",
