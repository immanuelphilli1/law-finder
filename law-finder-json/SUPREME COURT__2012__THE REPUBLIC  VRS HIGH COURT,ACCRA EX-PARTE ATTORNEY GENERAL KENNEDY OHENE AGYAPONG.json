  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC VRS HIGH COURT,ACCRA EX-PARTE ATTORNEY GENERAL KENNEDY OHENE AGYAPONG",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an application by the Attorney-General for a writ of certiorari to quash proceedings in the High Court, Accra, in the case of The Republic v Kennedy Ohene Agyapong. The Attorney-General argued that the High Court lacked jurisdiction because committal processes were improperly filed there instead of the District Court. However, the Court emphasized that certiorari is a discretionary remedy and noted that the Attorney-General had initiated the proceedings without objection, thereby acquiescing to the High Court's jurisdiction. Crucially, the Court held that the Attorney-General possessed an adequate alternative remedy through the statutory power of nolle prosequi under section 54 of the Criminal and Other Offences (Procedure) Act, 1960 (Act 30), which could achieve the same result without judicial intervention. The Court also found that allowing the application would constitute an abuse of process and forum shopping. Accordingly, the application was dismissed, reaffirming that discretionary remedies will not be granted where applicants fail to act promptly or have lawful means to resolve the issue themselves.",
