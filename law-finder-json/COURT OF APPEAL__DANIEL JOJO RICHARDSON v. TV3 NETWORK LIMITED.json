  "summary": "In this Court of Appeal decision from Ghana, Daniel Jojo Richardson, an executive cameraman and union official at TV3 Network Limited, was summarily dismissed after refusing to work beyond 5:00 PM for the production of a program featuring a guest observing Ramadan. The employer claimed insubordination, citing the need for overtime in the company's interest under Article 24(c) of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The Court found that while the employee's conduct could warrant disciplinary action, the company failed to follow the mandatory procedure under Article 20 of the Agreement, which required a formal charge to be preferred and an opportunity to respond. The absence of a formal charge and non-compliance with procedural fairness rendered the dismissal unlawful, despite the seriousness of the alleged misconduct. The Court also referenced Ex parte Tsawodzi to affirm that failure to follow statutory disciplinary procedures makes a dismissal ultra vires and null. Although the employee was not prejudiced by the lack of interdiction, the appeal was allowed due to procedural defects, underscoring that due process must be observed even in cases of gross insubordination.",
