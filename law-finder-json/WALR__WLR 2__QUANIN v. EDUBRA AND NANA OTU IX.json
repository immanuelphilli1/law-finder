  "summary": "In Quanin v. Edubra and Nana Otu IX (1957), the West African Court of Appeal addressed jurisdictional challenges in a land dispute involving a subject of Asin Atandanso State and the Omanhene of Abura State. The plaintiff initiated proceedings in the Native Court 'B' of Asin Atandanso, seeking tribute for land occupation. The co-defendant, Nana Otu IX, intervened and secured a transfer to the Land Court on grounds that the dispute affected two states and raised jurisdictional concerns. The Land Court re-transferred the case to the original Native Court, finding it competent. The appellate court upheld this decision, ruling that the dispute was not inter-state but between a state subject and a neighboring stool, and that the Native Court's territorial jurisdiction was not ousted by external intervention. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
