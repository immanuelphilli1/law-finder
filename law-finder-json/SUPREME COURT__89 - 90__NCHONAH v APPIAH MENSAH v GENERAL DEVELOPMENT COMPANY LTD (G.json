  "caseTitle": "NCHONAH v APPIAH",
  "summary": "This consolidated civil judgment from the Ghanaian High Court (Sekondi) on 26 May 1989, presided over by Adjabeng J, encompasses multiple personal injury and property damage claims arising from motor vehicle accidents. The cases include Nchonah v Appiah, Mensah v General Development Company Ltd (GDC Ltd), and Hammond v GDC Ltd. Awards are detailed across various plaintiffs, with compensation calculated for loss of earnings, pain and suffering, medical expenses, disfigurement, loss of amenities, and permanent disability. Notable awards include GHS 453,200 to the dependants of a deceased 32-year-old employee, GHS 2,000,000 to a professional driver who lost an arm, and GHS 1,410,000 to another driver who underwent leg amputation. Injuries range from fractures and dislocations to amputations and vision loss, with disability assessments from 15% to 80%. The court recognizes both formal and herbal medical treatments, and awards account for agricultural, commercial, and transportation livelihoods. Property damage claims include income-earning vehicles, with one award of GHS 900,000 made on an arbitrary basis due to unproven daily returns. The decisions reflect established principles of tort law in Ghana, emphasizing full compensation for past and future losses.",
