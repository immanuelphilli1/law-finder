  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal, sitting in Accra on April 4, 1939, reviewed a decision from the Divisional Court regarding the validity of a lease granted by Dan Cole, the son of the plaintiff, to the defendant. The lower court had ruled the lease invalid due to lack of formal authority under a Power of Attorney or agency. The appellate court held that the lease, being for a term of less than three years, did not require execution under seal and was valid in writing. Additionally, the plaintiff had consistently held Dan Cole out as his agent and property manager, supporting the agency claim. Even if the lease were invalid, the defendant qualified as a yearly tenant entitled to remain until served with proper notice to quit. Thus, the appeal was allowed, the lower court’s judgment reversed, and the plaintiff’s action dismissed. The cross-appeal was dismissed with costs.",
