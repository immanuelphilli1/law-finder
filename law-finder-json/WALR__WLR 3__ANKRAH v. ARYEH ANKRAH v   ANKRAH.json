  "caseTitle": "ANKRAH AND ANOTHER VERSUS ARYEH AND OTHERS",
  "summary": "This Privy Council appeal from the Gold Coast (now Ghana) concerned the devolution of self-acquired property upon the extinction of the matrilineal line under Ga customary law. Manche Ankrah died intestate, leaving property that initially passed to his surviving brothers as family property. Upon the death of the last brother, the matrilineal line failed. The plaintiffs, representing descendants of all three brothers, claimed succession, while the defendants argued only Manche Ankrah's direct descendants were entitled. The courts below held that the property passed to the collective descendants of the three brothers, a finding upheld by the Privy Council due to binding expert testimony on customary law. The Council affirmed that upon failure of the matrilineal line, succession extends to the patrilineal descendants of the entire sibling group. Additionally, the Council upheld an award of damages for trespass against a defendant who had no title but purported to alienate the land, as no native custom negated liability for such trespass.",
