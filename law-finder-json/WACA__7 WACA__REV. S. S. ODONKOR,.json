  "caseTitle": "REV. S. S. ODONKOR,",
  "summary": "This consolidated civil appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal in Accra (1941) involved land disputes originating from the Native Tribunal of the Ga State. The trial court granted declarations of title and awarded damages for trespass to plaintiffs Rev. S. S. Odonkor (representing the Presbyterian Church) and A. B. Nartey. The appellants, including Yaoteley Yaotey and the Acting Gbese Manche, challenged the judgment, arguing that the court should have halted proceedings due to alleged criminal fraud by plaintiff A. B. Nartey. The appellate court dismissed this argument, affirming that a civil action need not await criminal prosecution, as civil and public wrongs are distinct under common law. It upheld the trial court's factual findings, finding ample evidence of trespass. The appeal by the Acting Gbese Manche was struck out due to lack of standing after a new Gbese Manche was installed. All appeals were dismissed with costs.",
