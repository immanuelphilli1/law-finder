  "summary": "The Court of Appeal decision in Tobah v. Kweikumah clarified that the High Court does not have concurrent jurisdiction with traditional councils or regional houses of chiefs in chieftaincy matters as courts of first instance. The ruling affirmed that under the Chieftaincy Act, 1971 (Act 370) and the Courts Act, 1971 (Act 372), judicial committees of traditional councils hold exclusive jurisdiction over chieftaincy disputes arising within their areas, except where a paramount chief or the Asantehene is involved. The court rejected the argument that section 14(1)(a) of Act 372, granting the High Court original jurisdiction in 'all matters,' overrides section 52, which excludes chieftaincy matters from the High Court's jurisdiction. It emphasized that the phrase 'all matters' is subject to constitutional and statutory limitations. However, the High Court retains supervisory jurisdiction via prerogative writs like certiorari and prohibition to correct illegalities, fraud, or breaches of natural justice in traditional council proceedings. The decision resolved conflicting High Court rulings and reaffirmed the statutory framework for chieftaincy dispute resolution in Ghana.",
