  "summary": "This paper by Professor Ekow Daniels traces the development and resilience of customary law in Ghana amid colonial and post-colonial legal transformations. It highlights the foundational role of early legal reporting, particularly by John Mensah Sarbah, in preserving customary law through documented judicial decisions. The paper discusses the origins of customary law in pre-colonial ethnic groups and the challenges posed by British colonialism, which initially undermined indigenous legal systems. Despite this, the 1874 Supreme Court Ordinance formally recognized 'native law and custom' under specific conditions: it had to be proven to exist and not be repugnant to 'natural justice, equity and good conscience.' The judiciary, including figures like Chief Justice Macleod and Sarbah, played a crucial role in validating and preserving customary law. The author emphasizes the importance of law reporting and judicial interpretation in the survival and development of customary law in Ghana.",
