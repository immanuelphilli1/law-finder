  "caseTitle": "N'DOW VERSUS SAGNIA AND OTHERS.",
  "summary": "In N'Dow v. Sagnia and Others, the Supreme Court of the Colony of the Gambia upheld a public auction sale of jointly owned property despite the sale occurring outside the timeframe specified in the court's partition order. The plaintiff, a tenant in common, sought to set aside the sale on grounds of non-compliance with procedural timelines and notice requirements. The court held that such technical non-compliance did not invalidate the sale under Section 70 of the Conveyancing Act, 1881, which protects purchasers acting under court orders from defects in procedural adherence. The purchaser's title was affirmed, and the plaintiff's claims for damages failed due to lack of evidence and absence of actual harm. The court ordered execution of a conveyance to the purchaser.",
