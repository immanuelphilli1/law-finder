  "caseTitle": "TITLE REGISTRATION IN GHANA [1981& 82] VOLS. XIII & XIV RGL",
  "summary": "This legal analysis examines the concept and framework of title registration in Ghana, emphasizing that registration should concern estates or interests in land—such as allodial, leasehold, and usufructuary—rather than the physical land itself. The author critiques the current system of registering instruments affecting land as overly simplistic and argues for a reformed title registration system that recognizes legally significant, durable interests while excluding transient or personal rights like abusa, abunu, and short-term licences. It highlights challenges in registering vacant stool or government lands due to cost and boundary disputes, recommending that only lands with acquired private interests be registered. The paper supports granting possessory title to those who acquire land through adverse possession under the Limitation Decree, 1972. It also underscores the need for technical and administrative capacity in implementing any new system, noting past failures in documenting oral transfers. Drawing from English and Australian models, including the Torrens system, the author advocates for a structured, state-guaranteed title registration regime to enhance legal certainty and indefeasibility of titles in Ghana.",
