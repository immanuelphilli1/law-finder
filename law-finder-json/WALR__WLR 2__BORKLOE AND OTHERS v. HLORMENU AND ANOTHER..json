  "caseTitle": "BORKLOE AND OTHERS VERSUS HLORMENU AND ANOTHER.",
  "summary": "In Borkloe and Others v. Hlormenu and Another, the plaintiffs sued for a declaration of ownership over two swampy areas but lost at the trial Native Court, which erroneously granted a declaration of title and possession to the defendants despite no counterclaim. The Native Appeal Court set aside the judgment and ordered a rehearing de novo, citing discrepancies in land descriptions, admission of a void perpetual injunction, and refusal to amend the claim. The Supreme Court of Ghana, Eastern Judicial Division, held that the Native Appeal Court erred in remitting the case. It found the land identity was not in dispute, the void injunction was irrelevant after striking out the ultra vires relief, and the sought amendment was a substantive substitution, not a permissible detail change under Regulation 16. Thus, the appeal was allowed, the trial court's decision was restored with the ultra vires portion expunged, and costs were adjusted accordingly.",
