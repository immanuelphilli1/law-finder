  "caseTitle": "PETER M. IDUNDUN v S. E. O. IYARA",
  "summary": "This 1941 West Africa Court of Appeal decision addressed an appeal against a conviction by the High Court for wilful destruction of property and forcible entry under sections 451 and 81 of the Criminal Code. The appellant challenged the High Court's jurisdiction, arguing that the case was improperly before it after being 'remitted' by a Magistrate, who lacked authority to do so. The appellate court held that although the remittance was irregular, the High Court acquired proper jurisdiction by issuing hearing notices and proceeding summarily. The court affirmed the High Court's broad summary jurisdiction and found no merit in other grounds of appeal, dismissing the appeal.",
