  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF JAMES TAYLOR, DECEASED",
  "summary": "The appellant, William Mbole Muambo, was charged summarily on three counts: manslaughter under section 325 of the Criminal Code, committing a reckless and negligent act under section 343(e) of the Criminal Code, and possession of a poisonous or dangerous drug for illegal purposes under section 29 of the Poisons and Pharmacy Ordinance, No. 15/1927. A plea of guilty was recorded on all counts, and sentences were imposed. However, upon review, the West African Court of Appeal found that the appellant did not intend to admit facts constituting guilt, and thus, pleas of 'Not Guilty' should have been entered. As a result, the proceedings following the guilty plea were deemed a nullity. The appeal was allowed, the convictions and sentences were quashed, and acquittals were entered on all counts.",
