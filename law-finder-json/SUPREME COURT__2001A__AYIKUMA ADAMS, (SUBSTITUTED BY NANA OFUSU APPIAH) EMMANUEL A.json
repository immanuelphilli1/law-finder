  "caseTitle": "AYIKUMA ADAMS, (SUBSTITUTED BY NANA OFUSU APPIAH) EMMANUEL A",
  "summary": "This is a civil land dispute before the Supreme Court of Ghana concerning ownership of a plot in Awudome. The plaintiff, Ayikuma Adams (substituted by Nana Ofusu Appiah), claimed a customary grant of the land from the Manche Ankrah family in 1962 and immediate possession. The defendant, Emmanuel Tetteh Lomotey, claimed the land was allocated to his mother among 30 plots for family resettlement. The plaintiff sued for declaration of title and recovery of possession. The trial court and Court of Appeal ruled in favor of the plaintiff. On appeal, the Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' decisions, finding that the plaintiff discharged the burden of proof through credible and corroborated evidence, including testimony from Manche Ankrah family members. The defendant failed to call witnesses to support his claim, did not produce boundary owners, and relied on contradictory documents (Exhibits C and C1) that identified different plots. The court emphasized that unchallenged evidence, such as PW3's testimony confirming the plaintiff's grant and the non-acceptance of Plot No.5 by the defendant's mother, must be considered. The appeal was dismissed for lack of merit.",
