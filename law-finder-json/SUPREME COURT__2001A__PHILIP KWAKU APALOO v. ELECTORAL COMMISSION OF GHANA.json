  "caseTitle": "PHILIP KWAKU APALOO v. ELECTORAL COMMISSION OF GHANA",
  "summary": "In this constitutional case, the plaintiff, Philip Kwaku Apaloo, challenged the Electoral Commission of Ghana's directive that only voters with photo identity cards could vote in the 2000 elections, or alternatively, that those without such cards could only vote if all candidate agents unanimously affirmed their identity. The Supreme Court held that these directives, published in a Gazette Notice and internal guidelines, were invalid because they were not enacted through a constitutional instrument as required by Article 51 of the 1992 Constitution. The Court emphasized that the right to vote under Article 42 is fundamental and cannot be restricted by administrative measures that bypass constitutional procedures. It further ruled that requiring party agents to affirm voter identity compromised the independence of the Electoral Commission under Article 46. The Court declared the directives null and void and issued a permanent injunction against their enforcement, affirming that any regulatory changes must follow the proper constitutional process.",
