  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision addresses a civil appeal concerning the timeliness and jurisdictional validity of an appeal against a High Court judgment. The appellant sought to challenge a 2004 default judgment that had been upheld on a counterclaim, arguing it was obtained by fraud and based on a cancelled land title, and that he was not notified of proceedings. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal as out of time, holding that the High Court lacked jurisdiction to grant an extension of time after 22 months. The Supreme Court affirmed this, emphasizing that appeals are creatures of statute and must comply strictly with procedural rules, including time limits. It clarified that while void judgments can be challenged at any time under Mosi v. Bagyina, the proper procedural vehicle must be used, and an untimely appeal cannot be revived by alleging fraud. The appellant had previously failed to appeal the dismissal of his motion to set aside the judgment, thereby accepting its finality. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal's dismissal, reinforcing that jurisdiction cannot be assumed over an out-of-time appeal, regardless of the merits.",
