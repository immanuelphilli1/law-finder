  "summary": "This Privy Council appeal from the West African Court of Appeal concerned Dr. John Oni Akerele, a qualified medical practitioner in Nigeria, who was convicted of manslaughter and negligent administration of medicine following the death of a child, Kalu Ibe, after treatment for yaws using Sobita (sodium bismuth tartrate). The Assistant Judge at Umuahia convicted him on the manslaughter and negligent dispensing charges, sentencing him to three years’ hard labor and a fine. The West African Court of Appeal upheld the manslaughter conviction but quashed the sentence on the third charge and substituted a fine of £500. The Privy Council, on appeal, focused solely on whether the manslaughter conviction should be overturned. The Crown used evidence of nine other children's deaths to show a pattern and rebut claims of idiosyncratic reaction, which the Council found properly admitted to demonstrate that the case was not isolated. However, the Council ultimately allowed the appeal, setting aside the conviction due to insufficient evidence of criminal negligence beyond a reasonable doubt, emphasizing the high threshold for convicting a professional based on an adverse outcome.",
