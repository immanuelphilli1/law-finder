  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC v. HIGH COURT, ACCRA",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an application for review filed by Ayishetu Afoda and Mama Jima Afoda, who had been found guilty of contempt by the High Court for reoccupying a property after a writ of possession was executed. The applicants argued that the writ was invalid due to a pending application for stay of execution pending appeal. The Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle that orders of a court of competent jurisdiction must be obeyed even if allegedly erroneous or improvidently made, and that disobedience cannot be justified by claiming the order was void. Citing numerous authorities including Russel vrs. East Anglian Railway Co. and The Republic vrs. Brew, the Court emphasized that the proper remedy is to challenge the order through formal legal channels such as appeal or application for setting aside, not through self-help. The Court dismissed the review application to uphold the authority of judicial processes and prevent litigants from unilaterally determining the validity of court orders.",
