  "caseTitle": "DR. CLEMENT APAAKVRS. THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana, in a unanimous decision, ruled that the Minister for Local Government lacked constitutional authority to create electoral areas, a power exclusively vested in the Electoral Commission under Article 45(b) of the 1992 Constitution. The Court declared that certain Legislative Instruments (LIs), including LI 1843, which purported to divide local government areas into electoral areas, were unconstitutional and void to the extent they infringed on the Electoral Commission's mandate. While the Court granted declarations that the LIs were made in contravention of the Constitution and were null and void in part, it qualified the injunction against conducting elections by allowing the use of electoral areas if they coincided with those lawfully established by the Electoral Commission. The judgment emphasized the need for clear legislative language that respects constitutional demarcation of powers.",
