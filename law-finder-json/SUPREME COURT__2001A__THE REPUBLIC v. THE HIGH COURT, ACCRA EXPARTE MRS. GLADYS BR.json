  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC v. THE HIGH COURT, ACCRA EXPARTE MRS. GLADYS BR",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana granted certiorari to quash the High Court of Accra's judgment and orders in a consolidated suit involving ownership and management of Speedline Stevedoring Company Ltd. The High Court had relied on findings from a prior Circuit Court case in which Mr. Dolphyne was declared a shareholder and director, but those declarations had been set aside by the Supreme Court due to lack of jurisdiction under the Companies Code 1963 (Act 179). The Supreme Court held that the High Court could not rely on an invalidated judgment as res judicata. It further ruled that the claims related to pre-incorporation conduct, governed by Section 13 of Act 179, which provides that such contracts do not bind the company unless adopted post-incorporation. The High Court’s orders—reassigning management, altering signatories, and directing payment of legal fees—were found to exceed the reliefs sought and the court’s jurisdiction. The decision reaffirmed the principle that only the High Court has jurisdiction over company matters and emphasized the limits of judicial authority in corporate administration.",
