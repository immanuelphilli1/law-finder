  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case involved a dispute over the expiration of a 32-year lease agreement dated 2 October 1965 for Plot No. D774/3, Okaishie, Accra. The plaintiffs, successors of the late Kwaku Mireku, sought either variation of the lease on grounds of unconscionability or a declaration of statutory tenancy after the lease expired in 1997. The defendants, heirs of the original landowner, refused renewal and sought possession. The High Court and Court of Appeal ruled against the plaintiffs, finding the lease conscionable and no basis for statutory tenancy. The Supreme Court affirmed these decisions, holding that the lease was fair, legally executed, and that repairs and an unauthorized fourth-floor addition by the lessee were not grounds for compulsory renewal. The court emphasized that courts cannot create new contracts and that the plaintiffs had economically benefited from the improvements. The appeal was dismissed.",
