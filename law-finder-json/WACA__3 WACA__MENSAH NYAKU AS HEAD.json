  "caseTitle": "MENSAH NYAKU AS HEAD",
  "summary": "This 1937 West Africa Court of Appeal decision arose from an appeal against a Divisional Court's refusal to strike out a writ involving multiple plaintiffs and complex claims over land ownership, deed cancellation, and royalties. The plaintiffs, representing various family heads, claimed co-ownership of land granted via an indenture in 1933 and alleged that the defendant fraudulently induced the testator to execute a deed of gift instead of a new will. The defendant objected on grounds of jurisdiction, lack of cause of action, and improper joinder. The appellate court held that the multiple joinder of parties and causes—particularly combining a land ownership claim (cognizable by a Native Tribunal) with claims requiring interpretation of English legal documents—created such inconvenience and embarrassment that a fair trial was impossible. Citing Order 3, Rule 8 of the Courts Ordinance, 1935, the court ruled the Divisional Court should have struck out the writ. The appeal was allowed, the writ was struck out without prejudice, and plaintiffs were permitted to pursue their claims separately in the appropriate courts.",
