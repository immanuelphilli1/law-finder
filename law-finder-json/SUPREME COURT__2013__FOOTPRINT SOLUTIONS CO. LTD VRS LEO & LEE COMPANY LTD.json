  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an appeal challenging the Court of Appeal's decision to grant a stay of proceedings in a commercial dispute between Footprint Solutions Co. Ltd (Appellant) and Leo & Lee Company Ltd (Respondent). The case originated from a claim for recovery of GHC 20,000 paid for a faulty printer, with the Respondent seeking a change of venue from Kumasi to Accra based on the contract's execution location. After the High Court denied the venue change, the Respondent appealed and filed for a stay of proceedings before the High Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Appellant. The Court of Appeal granted the stay, which the Appellant challenged as invalid due to the finality of the summary judgment. The Supreme Court upheld the stay, ruling it was properly granted under Rule 27A of C.I. 19 because the interlocutory appeal on venue was pending when the application was filed. The Court emphasized the inherent jurisdiction of appellate courts to manage proceedings and prevent injustice, even after final judgment, provided execution had not been completed. It also ordered the Respondent to expedite the appeal on the summary judgment to resolve the underlying dispute.",
