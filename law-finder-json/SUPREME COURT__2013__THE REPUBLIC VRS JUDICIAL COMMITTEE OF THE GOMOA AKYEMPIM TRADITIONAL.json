  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC VRS JUDICIAL COMMITTEE OF THE GOMOA AKYEMPIM TRADITIONAL",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana judgment addresses a civil appeal concerning the validity of a decision by the Judicial Committee of the Gomoa Akyempim Traditional Council. The Committee had granted an order in a chieftaincy dispute without hearing the appellant, Opanin Pobee, after the first and second defendants applied for disjoinder. The Committee declared the election of the third defendant as Tufuhene null and void and awarded costs, effectively deciding the substantive claim without a hearing. The appellant sought judicial review via certiorari, arguing a breach of the right to be heard (audi alteram partem). Both the High Court and Court of Appeal dismissed the application, stating an appeal was the proper remedy. The Supreme Court reversed this, holding that a denial of the right to be heard is a fundamental breach of natural justice that vitiates any decision, even if the tribunal has jurisdiction. The Court emphasized that such a breach transforms a jurisdictional exercise into an excess or lack of jurisdiction, making certiorari the appropriate remedy. Consequently, the Supreme Court found the lower courts erred in law and allowed the appeal, quashing the Committee's order as a nullity.",

  "verdict": "The appeal was allowed. The Supreme Court held that the Judicial Committee's order of 3/4/2009 was a nullity due to a breach of the audi alteram partem rule and should have been quashed by the High Court via certiorari. The judgments of the High Court and Court of Appeal were therefore set aside.",
