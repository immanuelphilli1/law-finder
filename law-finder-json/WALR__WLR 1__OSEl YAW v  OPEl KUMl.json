  "caseTitle": "OSEl YAW v OPEl KUMl",
  "summary": "The appellant, Osei Yaw, sued the respondent, Opei Kum, for specific performance of an agreement dated October 14, 1952, for the sale of a house in Kumasi for £3,800. The appellant also sought, in the alternative, the return of £3,852 10s. The respondent denied liability, arguing ambiguity in the agreement and claiming the intended purchase price was £4,800, including a pre-existing mortgage debt of £1,000. The trial judge found the agreement expressed the parties' intention but admitted extrinsic evidence. The appellate court held that the agreement was unambiguous and that extrinsic evidence could not be used to vary its terms. The appeal was allowed, the lower court's judgment set aside, and the counterclaim dismissed, affirming that the written agreement must be interpreted based on its plain language without reference to prior transactions.",
