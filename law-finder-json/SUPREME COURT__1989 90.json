  "summary": "The document contains summaries of multiple unreported civil decisions from the Ghanaian Supreme Court between 2008 and 2009, covering diverse areas of law including contract, land, family, election, administrative, and labour law. Key cases include Yaa Antwi v N.T.H.C., where the court examined whether an exchange of letters constituted a binding contract for the sale of a house, emphasizing the need for intention to create legal relations and proper communication of payment details. In Sumaila Sanunu v Franklin Gado Salifu, the court considered claims over profit-sharing under a joint execution agreement for a government contract, with issues around summary judgment. Another significant case, Ghana Cable Co. Ltd v Barclays Bank (Gh.) Ltd, addressed whether a bank's refusal to extend credit under an existing facility constituted a breach of contract entitling the company to damages for business collapse. Several rulings also touched on procedural fairness, jurisdictional limits, and constitutional rights, such as the right to be heard under Article 14(1) of the 1992 Constitution.",
