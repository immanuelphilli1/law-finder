  "summary": "This is a review application before the Supreme Court of Ghana, filed by Mr. Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa and Dr. Edward Kofi Omane Boamah, seeking to overturn a May 22, 2012 judgment concerning the interpretation of Articles 20(5) and (6) of the 1992 Constitution on state property. The applicants argued that exceptional circumstances and a fundamental error in constitutional interpretation resulted in a miscarriage of justice. They primarily sought for the Court to depart from its prior decision in Nii Kpobi Tetteh Tsuru III v Attorney-General [2011] SCGLR 1042, which held that land acquired before the 1992 Constitution remained unaffected by its provisions. The Court, per Dr. Date-Bah, JSC, dismissed the application, emphasizing that a review is not an appeal and requires proof of a fundamental error, not mere disagreement. The applicants had not previously urged the Court to depart from precedent during the original hearing, weakening their case. Additionally, they abandoned their claim of newly discovered evidence. The Court held that following a binding precedent does not constitute error and that no exceptional circumstances justifying review were established. Atuguba, JSC, concurred, noting that the applicants failed to provide evidence on the terms of land acquisition and that their argument did not engage with key constitutional nuances under Article 36(8). The application was dismissed as unmeritorious.",
