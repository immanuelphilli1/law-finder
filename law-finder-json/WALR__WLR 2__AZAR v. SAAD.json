  "caseTitle": "AZAR VERSUS SAAD.",
  "summary": "In Azar v. Saad, the West African Court of Appeal upheld a landlord's recovery of possession of premises used partly for residence and partly for business, under s. 11(1)(d) of the Rent Control Ordinance, 1952. The court held that the phrase 'any premises' in the provision encompasses all tenanted premises, and the requirement that the premises be 'required for personal occupation as a dwelling-house' refers only to the purpose of the landlord's use, not the prior use by the tenant. Thus, even mixed-use premises qualify if the landlord genuinely needs them for family occupation. The appeal, which argued that s. 11(1)(d) applied only to exclusively residential premises, was dismissed.",
