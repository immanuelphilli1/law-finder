  "summary": "This compilation from 1981\u001382 presents notable judicial observations from Ghana's superior courts on diverse legal and social issues. Judges addressed the impact of rising cost of living on low-income earners, emphasizing economic hardship as a societal concern. Key legal principles include the necessity for courts to articulate specific demeanour when rejecting witness testimony, the inadmissibility of technical objections that obstruct justice, and the limits of judicial notice. The sanctity of marriage and statutory standards in divorce were reaffirmed, while individual rights and executive accountability were underscored as essential to national stability. The document also highlights that ingratitude, while morally significant, does not constitute a criminal offence, and that official good faith cannot substitute for legal evidence.",
