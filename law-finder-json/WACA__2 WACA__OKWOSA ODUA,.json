  "caseTitle": "OKWOSA ODUA,",
  "summary": "This civil appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal concerned a dispute over title to a parcel of land called Iyiowa in Onitsha between the Odekpe people (plaintiffs) and the Umuoputa Orifite family (defendant). The Divisional Court had granted the plaintiffs a declaration of ownership and an injunction restricting the defendant's use of the land, allowing only continued habitation by Mbanefo village residents under plaintiffs' authority. The defendant appealed, arguing lack of jurisdiction and res judicata based on prior native court decisions. The appellate court dismissed the appeal, holding that the Divisional Court properly acquired jurisdiction through a valid transfer order, despite procedural irregularities in party substitution. It further ruled that prior native court cases (Ugboma v. Agbmu, Mbanefo v. Ofoni, Kodilinye v. Mbanefo) did not constitute res judicata, as they involved different parties, subject matter, and legal issues, and did not finally determine the ownership claim between the current parties.",
