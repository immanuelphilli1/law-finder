  "caseTitle": "RANSFORD OPOKU & ORS VRS. LIBHERR FRANCE SAS. PAUL JOOSTEN 23RD NOVEMBER, 2011 CIVIL APPEAL",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed the appeal filed by Ransford Opoku and others against Libherr France SAS and Paul Joosten, affirming the Court of Appeal's reversal of a trial court order for reinstatement. The appellant, a self-described whistleblower, was terminated after bringing police to the workplace without authorization and subsequently filing a redundancy claim. The trial court had ruled the termination amounted to contempt of court, but the Supreme Court held that the dismissal did not obstruct justice or prejudice the pending redundancy suit, as the claim did not hinge on continued employment. Relying on established principles, the Court emphasized that contempt requires actual interference with the subject matter of litigation and reaffirmed the need to narrowly interpret contempt powers to safeguard individual rights.",
