  "caseTitle": "ALLOTEY VERSUS ABRAHAMS TAMAKLOE",
  "summary": "This consolidated civil action involved disputes over title to Sempe Stool land in Ghana, where plaintiffs sought recovery of possession, declarations of title, and damages for trespass. The defendant challenged the validity of land conveyances executed by the Sempe Mantse in 1946, claiming he was the Stool Father whose consent was required, and that he had acquired ownership by paying the stool's debts. The court held that under native custom, payment of stool debts does not confer ownership or subrogation rights. It further found that the defendant was not the Stool Father and, even if he held an office, his prolonged non-participation in stool affairs estopped him from challenging transactions conducted without his consent. The conveyances, executed by the Mantse with some elders and linguists and stating consent of relevant parties, were upheld as valid, especially given evidence of actual consent. The 1948 Native Court judgment relied on by the defendant was deemed ineffective as it post-dated the conveyance and had no retroactive effect. The court also ruled that Native Courts lack jurisdiction to issue perpetual injunctions or compel accounting of stool funds. Due to the defendant's repeated contempt of court in similar matters, exemplary damages were awarded.",
