  "caseTitle": "KAROUCHI UNIVERSAL TRADING LTD v. KWAME DZADEY JNR. AND",
  "summary": "The Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant's challenge to the validity of an arbitral award on jurisdictional grounds, holding that the arbitrators' extension of time to issue the award—done in writing and without timely objection—was valid and did not nullify the award. The court emphasized that mere delay, especially with tacit party consent, does not invalidate an award absent substantial injustice. However, the appeal succeeded in part: the court found that the arbitrators failed to rule on two distinct and severable issues—(e) the present-day value of shares held by the Dzadeys in Karouchi Mining, and (g) whether Karouchi Universal had invested money in Karouchi Mining and how much. This omission amounted to misconduct. Additionally, the arbitrators breached natural justice by examining expert witnesses in the absence of the parties, denying them the right to cross-examine. Consequently, the court set aside the award only on these two issues and remitted them for reconsideration, while upholding the rest of the award under the principle of severability.",
