  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC v THE AUTOMATED FAST TRACKHIGH COURT ACCRAEX-P",
  "summary": "This 2008 Supreme Court of Ghana ruling addressed an application by MacLeod & Snowrad Ltd. to invoke the Court's supervisory jurisdiction under Article 132 of the 1992 Constitution, seeking certiorari and prohibition orders against the Automated Fast Track High Court, Accra. The applicants challenged the jurisdiction of Justice Gyeasayor, arguing his assumption of the case was improper. The core issue was when the 90-day limitation period under Supreme Court Rule 62 began to run. The Court held that although the applicants first became aware of the alleged jurisdictional defect on 21st January 2008, they unreasonably delayed filing the application until 9th June 2008—well beyond the 90-day deadline ending 20th April 2008. The Court analogized Section 22 of the Limitation Decree (N.R.C.D. 54) to determine the start of the limitation period upon discovery of the defect, but found no reasonable diligence in the delay. Consequently, the preliminary objection was upheld, and the application was struck out as time-barred and incompetent.",
