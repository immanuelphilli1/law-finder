  "caseTitle": "HAJAARA FARMS LTD VRS SOCIETE GENERALE- SOCIAL SECURITY BANK",
  "summary": "In this 2012 Supreme Court of Ghana decision, Hajaara Farms Ltd sued Societe Generale-Social Security Bank for wrongful detention and disposal of ten Renault tractors imported under a loan agreement. The bank seized all tractors upon arrival, released five under new terms, and later sold all ten without the company's consent. The High Court found the bank liable in tort for conversion, discharged the company from repaying the loan due to the bank's fundamental breach, and awarded damages. The Court of Appeal upheld this. The Supreme Court reviewed whether concurrent liability in contract and tort justified both debt discharge and damages, noting the absence of the loan agreement in evidence. While recognizing concurrent liability as valid under modern law (citing Henderson v Merrett), the Court expressed concern over double compensation and emphasized equity, unconscionability, and the commercial implications of forfeiting loan repayment rights due to procedural breaches.",

  "verdict": "The Supreme Court set aside the lower courts' judgment on the issue of discharging the loan obligation, holding that the company could not be absolved from repayment while also claiming full damages for conversion, as this would result in double recovery. The matter was remitted for determination of appropriate compensation consistent with principles of equity and non-forfeiture.",
