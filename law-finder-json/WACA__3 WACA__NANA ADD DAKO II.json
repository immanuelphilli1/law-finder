  "summary": "This 1936 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Nana Add Dako II v. District Commissioner Birrim concerned a constitutional challenge to Ordinance No.3 of 1935, which established stool treasuries in Asamangkese and Akwatia. The plaintiffs, traditional leaders and stools, claimed the ordinance was ultra vires the Legislative Council and repugnant to English law, seeking a declaration of invalidity and an injunction. The Divisional Court ordered parts of the statement of claim struck out and required amendment to specify the grounds of repugnancy and ultra vires. On appeal, the WACA upheld the order, affirming that courts may strike out irrelevant or prejudicial matter under Order 26, Rule 1 of the General Procedure Rules to ensure a fair trial. The court emphasized that plaintiffs must particularize claims of unconstitutionality and that the validity of legislation is judged by legal competence, not policy necessity. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
