  "summary": "The Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from the Land Court, Eastern Judicial Division, in a land case originally heard by a Native Court. In doing so, van Lare J.A. addressed procedural concerns regarding the Native Court's visit to the locus in quo. The court criticized the practice where a judge descended into the witness box to give an oath-bound report of the inspection, making them subject to cross-examination. It emphasized that judges should not become witnesses to preserve impartiality, citing Keteku v. Dzogbenuku with approval. Instead, a written report of the inspection should be attached to the record. The court recommended that Native Courts adopt the practice in R. v. Dogbe, where the court visits the site with parties and counsel, witnesses identify features on-site, and only those witnesses (not judges) later testify under oath about their observations.",
