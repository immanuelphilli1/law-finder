  "summary": "In Balogun and Others v. Edusei and Another, the High Court of Ghana's Eastern Judicial Division held that the deportation of four individuals by the Minister of the Interior and the Acting Commissioner of Police, while habeas corpus and certiorari applications were sub judice, constituted contempt of court. Despite no formal service of the court order, the respondents had clear knowledge of the proceedings through direct communication from applicants' counsel and Crown Law Officers. The court ruled that actual service was not necessary for contempt where knowledge of the order was established. The deportations effectively terminated ongoing judicial review, thereby interfering with the administration of justice. The court rejected certiorari as an appropriate remedy due to insufficient evidence on citizenship, emphasizing that declaratory actions are proper for factual disputes. The decision affirmed that state actors cannot evade judicial scrutiny by acting on executive orders without regard to pending legal processes.",
