  "summary": "The case involves a land dispute between Yode Kwao (plaintiff-appellant) and Kwasi Coker (defendant-respondent) over a parcel of land in the Gold Coast Colony (now Ghana). The plaintiff claimed damages for trespass, asserting ownership through a 1926 purchase from Nkansa. The defendant traced his title to Aboagye, whose ownership was confirmed by a 1908 Native Tribunal judgment in Aboagye v. Nkansa and a 1909 Divisional Court judgment in Coker v. Nmate. The key issue was whether the earlier judgments constituted *res judicata* and estopped the plaintiff from relitigating the land’s ownership. The West African Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court’s ruling that the plaintiff was bound by the prior decisions, as he and Nmate were part of the same syndicate with identical interests, and the plaintiff had acquiesced in the earlier proceedings without seeking to join. Thus, the plaintiff was estopped from asserting title.",

The plaintiff, Yode Kwao, was found to be estopped from litigating the ownership of the land due to the prior binding judgments in favor of the defendant's predecessor-in-title, particularly the 1909 decision in Coker v. Nmate, which resolved the boundary and ownership issue affecting the syndicate of which the plaintiff was a member.",
