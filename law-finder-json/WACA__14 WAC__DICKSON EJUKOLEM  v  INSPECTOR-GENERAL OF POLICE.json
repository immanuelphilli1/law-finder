  "caseTitle": "DICKSON EJUKOLEM v INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF POLICE",
  "summary": "The appellant, Dickson Ejukelem, was convicted by a Magistrate on two counts of unlawful possession of metalliferous minerals under section 430(1) of the Criminal Code. After the defence closed its case, the Magistrate called three additional prosecution witnesses, which contributed to the conviction. On appeal to the Supreme Court, the conviction was set aside due to improper admission of evidence and misdirection on the onus of proof. However, the Judge ordered a re-trial on the first count. The West African Court of Appeal held that while the appeal was rightly allowed, ordering a re-trial was erroneous and unfair, as it allowed the prosecution a second chance to use improperly admitted evidence. Additionally, the Judge was under a misapprehension regarding the quality of the tin involved, which undermined the basis for re-trial. The order for re-trial was quashed, and an acquittal was entered.",
