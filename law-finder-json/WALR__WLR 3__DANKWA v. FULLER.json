  "caseTitle": "DANKWA VERSUS FULLER",
  "summary": "This Court of Appeal decision in Ghana addresses the validity of an ex parte order extending time to file grounds of appeal from a Native Court decision. The plaintiff, having won at first instance but lost on appeal, obtained an ex parte extension from the Land Court (Benson J.) to file appeal grounds. When the appeal was later challenged as out of time, Manyo-Plange J. quashed the extension, ruling it ultra vires and invalid due to lack of notice to the respondent. The Court of Appeal held that the original extension order was valid and binding, as only the issuing judge or a higher court could set it aside. It further ruled that Rule 129(1) of the Native Courts (Ashanti) Procedure Rules, 1949, implicitly grants jurisdiction to extend time, and that such applications may be made ex parte in the absence of an express requirement for notice. The appeal was allowed, the striking out order set aside, and the matter remitted for hearing.",
