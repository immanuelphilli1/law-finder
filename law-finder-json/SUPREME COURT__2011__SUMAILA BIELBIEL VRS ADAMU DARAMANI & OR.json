  "caseTitle": "SUMAILA BIELBIEL VRS ADAMU DARAMANI & OR",
  "summary": "In this 2011 ruling by the Ghanaian Supreme Court, the plaintiff, Sumaila Bielbiel, sought a declaration that Adamu Daramani, who holds a British passport, was in violation of Articles 94(2)(a) and 97(1)(e) of the 1992 Constitution by continuing to serve in Parliament while owing allegiance to a foreign country. The defendant challenged the Supreme Court's jurisdiction, arguing that the matter had already been adjudicated by the Court of Appeal and that the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was improperly invoked. The Court, per Gbadegbe JSC, held that the plaintiff's claim involved a continuing constitutional breach, thereby creating a new cause of action not barred by res judicata. The Court affirmed its original jurisdiction under Articles 2(1) and 130(1) of the Constitution to hear matters involving enforcement of constitutional provisions, even without a prior appeal. The defendant's failure to dispute the factual basis—particularly the possession of a British passport—was treated as an admission, warranting further inquiry. The Court rejected the argument that original jurisdiction requires both interpretation and enforcement, emphasizing that enforcement alone suffices. Thus, the Supreme Court ruled it had jurisdiction to proceed.",
