  "caseTitle": "DENKYERA STATE VERSUS ABURA STATE",
  "summary": "This 1956 West African Court of Appeal decision resolved a jurisdictional dispute between Denkyera State and Abura State over land boundaries, trespass, and injunctions. The core issue was whether the Land Court or a Native Court had authority to hear the case. The court held that no Native Court was competent due to both territorial limitations and the risk of bias, as Native Court members, being subjects of their respective stools, could not impartially adjudicate disputes involving their own state's land claims. Thus, under section 24(4)(a) of the Courts Ordinance, c. 4 of 1951, the Land Court had exclusive original jurisdiction. The ruling emphasized that 'competent' includes not only legal jurisdiction but also the absence of bias, aligning with the principle of nemo judex in causa sua. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the Land Court's authority to proceed.",
