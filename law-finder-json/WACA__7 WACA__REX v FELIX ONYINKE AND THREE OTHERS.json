  "caseTitle": "REX v FELIX ONYINKE AND THREE OTHERS",
  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal was asked whether Buraimoh Biu, a convicted murderer under sentence of death, was a competent witness at trial. The court held that despite the common law rule and the precedent in R. v. Webb (1867), which rendered such persons incompetent due to 'attainder', the Forfeiture Act 1870 abolished attainder and corruption of blood. Section 1 of the Act declared that conviction for felony or treason would not result in attainder, thereby removing the legal disability. Consequently, the court ruled that a convicted murderer under sentence of death is a competent witness. The decision affirms statutory reform over outdated common law principles.",
