  "caseTitle": "BOGOSO GOLD LIMITED ]",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana upheld the lower courts' finding that Bogoso Gold Limited was liable for damage to the cocoa farms of the plaintiffs, the Estate of Joseph Ntrakwa, through the emission of noxious fumes from its plant. The Court determined the cause of action was rooted in nuisance rather than negligence, as the emissions constituted an unlawful interference with the plaintiffs' enjoyment of their land. It rejected the defendant's late-raised limitation defense under section 3(1) of the Limitation Act, NRCD 54, ruling it should have been pleaded earlier and that the tort was of a continuing nature. The Court found the plaintiffs had discharged their evidential burden by showing a decline in cocoa harvest following the plant's installation and credible inspection findings, while the defendant failed to provide convincing evidence to rebut causation. The award of damages for past and future loss of farm income was affirmed as reasonable and appropriate, given the nature of the losses, which could not be precisely calculated. The appeal was accordingly dismissed.",
