  "caseTitle": "SOPHIA MALM",
  "summary": "This 1937 West African Court of Appeal decision in *Sophia Malm v. Maurice Meyer Wulff* arose from a land dispute transferred from a Native Tribunal to the Divisional Court. The plaintiff sought to amend the writ to sue both personally and as head of her family, but the trial judge refused, leading counsel to discontinue the case, which was then struck out. The appeal challenged the refusal to amend the writ. The appellate court dismissed the appeal on three grounds: no pending case for interlocutory appeal, lack of jurisdiction to amend in a way that alters the parties' legal identities, and proper judicial discretion in refusing amendment. A dissenting opinion argued the court had power to amend under Supreme Court rules to address the real issue in dispute.",
