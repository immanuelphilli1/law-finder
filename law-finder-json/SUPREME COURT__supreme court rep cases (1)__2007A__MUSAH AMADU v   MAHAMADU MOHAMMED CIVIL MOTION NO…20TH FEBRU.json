  "caseTitle": "MUSAH AMADU v MAHAMADU MOHAMMED CIVIL MOTION NO…20TH FEBRU",
  "summary": "In this 2007 Supreme Court of Ghana ruling, the applicant, Musah Amadu, sought to invoke the court's supervisory jurisdiction under article 132 of the 1992 Constitution to obtain a prohibition order preventing Justice Simon Suurbare of the High Court, Tamale, from hearing a contempt motion against him. The applicant alleged bias due to a perceived friendship between the judge and the respondent's lawyer, animosity, and unfair treatment. These claims were supported by circumstantial evidence, including a prior ruling by the judge, alleged early morning meetings, and a telephone conversation. The Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, held that the evidence failed to establish a real likelihood of bias on the balance of probabilities. The court dismissed the application, emphasizing that unsubstantiated allegations, especially those based on conjecture, cannot justify interference with judicial proceedings.",
