  "caseTitle": "DORIS NAADU NARTEY v CHRISTIAN KUMI",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case, Doris Naadu Nartey v Christian Kumi (2007), arose from a dispute over the administration of property bequeathed under the will of Christian William Kumi. The plaintiff, Doris Nartey (widow), and her son sought enforcement of their equal share in a property at W.39 Boi Man, Abeka, as per the will, and to block the defendant, Christian Kumi (son), from selling it. The High Court entered judgment for the plaintiff in 2003 after a de novo hearing where the defendant was absent. The defendant’s application to set aside the judgment—on grounds of lack of notice—was denied in 2003. The Court of Appeal affirmed that decision. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, ruling that the defendant was not properly served with a hearing notice for the 10 December 2002 trial, breaching the audi alteram partem principle of natural justice. The absence of an affidavit or record of service, especially via substituted means, invalidated the proceedings. The judgment was therefore set aside.",
