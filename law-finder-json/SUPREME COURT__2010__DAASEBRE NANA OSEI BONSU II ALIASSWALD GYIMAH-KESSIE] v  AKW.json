  "caseTitle": "DAASEBRE NANA OSEI BONSU II ALIASSWALD GYIMAH-KESSIE] v AKW",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana judgment arises from a defamation suit initiated by Daasebre Nana Osei Bonsu II (Mamponghene) against Akwasi Mensah, Ben Ephson, The Daily Dispatch, and Allied News Limited over a 2003 article titled \"Mamponghene in 264 million cedis fraud.\" The High Court initially dismissed the claim, but the Court of Appeal reversed, awarding damages. The Supreme Court considered whether the defence of fair comment applied. It held that the article constituted fair comment on a matter of public interest, given the plaintiff's status as a traditional leader and the pending petition before the Asantehene. The Court found no malice and ruled that the appellants merely reported facts from the petition without exaggeration. It also determined that the procedural error in naming the court in the notice of appeal did not invalidate the appeal. Consequently, the Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the Court of Appeal’s judgment, and restored the High Court’s dismissal.",
