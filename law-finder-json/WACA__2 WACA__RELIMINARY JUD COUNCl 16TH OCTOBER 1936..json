  "summary": "This Privy Council preliminary judgment from 16th October 1936 concerns an appeal from the West African Court of Appeal, which had set aside a judgment of the Divisional Court at Cape Coast Castle. The case involved the United African Company, Ltd. (respondent) suing its former agent, Taylor, for negligence and breach of contract under a written agreement dated 30 July 1933, claiming a loss of £7,816. The statement of claim did not allege fraud or criminal conduct. During trial, two convicted employees, Acquah and Carr, testified that Taylor had taken the money, suggesting fraud or felony. The trial judge accepted this evidence, ruled the action an abuse of process, and nonsuited the plaintiffs on the basis that the felony was not prosecuted, citing Smith v. Selwyn. The Privy Council held that the trial judge erred in allowing unpleaded criminal allegations, as charges of fraud or felony must be clearly pleaded. The plaintiffs had reasonably refrained from private prosecution after police and law officers declined to prosecute due to insufficient evidence. The Court emphasized that the case was properly one for negligence or breach of contract, and the defendant must be presumed innocent. The Privy Council found that the Court of Appeal also misdirected itself by focusing on the non-prosecution issue, which was irrelevant since no criminal charge was properly before the court. Although the evidence suggested some loss due to negligence, the Privy Council adjourned the matter to properly assess quantum of damages, noting that prior correspondence indicated the negligence-based damages were not fully argued.",
