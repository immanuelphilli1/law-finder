  "caseTitle": "QUARTEY v. JOHN HAMMOND,",
  "summary": "In this Ghanaian civil appeal, the Court of Appeal set aside a default judgment rendered by the Circuit Court in favor of the plaintiff, Y. K. Quartey, against the defendant, John Hammond. The appeal centered on procedural irregularities, particularly the plaintiff's failure to comply with Order 64 Rule 12 of the High Court (Civil) Procedure Rules 1954 (LN 140), which mandates a one-month notice to the opposing party before resuming proceedings inactive for over a year. Additionally, although substituted service was ordered in July 1994, there was no evidence that it was properly executed or that hearing notices for the 6th and 10th July 1995 court dates were served on the defendant. The Court emphasized the cardinal principle of fair hearing, citing that a party cannot be condemned without proper notice. Consequently, the Court held the proceedings null and void, set aside the judgment, and remitted the case for a fresh hearing de novo.",
