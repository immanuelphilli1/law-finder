  "caseTitle": "OPANIN KWAME AFREH v. COPYRIGHT SOCIETY OF GHANA",
  "summary": "The Court of Appeal of Ghana reversed a High Court ruling that denied the Copyright Society of Ghana (COSGA) the right to collect royalties from drinking bar operators for playing recorded music. The appellate court held that the public playing of musical works in commercial establishments such as bars constitutes 'communication to the public' under section 6(1)(c) of the Copyright Law, 1985 (PNDCL 110), thereby entitling authors to royalties. The court emphasized that the Bandrole system purchase tax does not negate the obligation to pay copyright fees, rejecting the argument of double taxation. It clarified that section 6(1)(c), not section 36, governs the issue, and affirmed COSGA's authority under LI 1527 to collect and distribute royalties. The decision aligns Ghanaian law with international standards, particularly the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT), recognizing the economic rights of authors.",
