  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC V LT SETH ODURO",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed the Republic's appeal against a decision of the Court Martial Appeal Court (CMAC) on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction. The respondent, Lieutenant Seth Oduro, had been convicted by a General Court Martial for being absent without leave, but the CMAC quashed the conviction, ruling that the convening officer lacked authority. The Republic appealed directly to the Supreme Court without seeking special leave. The Court held that no statutory or constitutional provision grants a right of appeal from the CMAC to the Supreme Court as of right. It emphasized that appeals in Ghana are strictly creatures of statute and that Article 131(2) of the 1992 Constitution, which allows for special leave to appeal, does not confer such a right where none exists. The Court also rejected the Republic’s argument that the appeal was from the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division), noting that the correct appellate body is the CMAC, established under the Armed Forces Act, 1962 (Act 105), and not the regular Court of Appeal. Since the Republic failed to apply for special leave and had no statutory right to appeal, the appeal was struck out.",
