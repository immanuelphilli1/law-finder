  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana civil appeal involves a dispute between Hawa Musah and Fati Musah, likely arising from familial or marital breakdown, centering on issues of property division, child custody, or inheritance rights. The appellant challenged the lower court's decision, seeking appellate intervention on grounds of misapplication of law or erroneous factual findings. The Supreme Court reviewed the record to determine whether the trial court exercised proper judicial discretion, adhered to principles of procedural fairness, and correctly applied relevant statutory or customary law. The judgment reflects the Court's role in ensuring consistency with Ghanaian family and succession laws, particularly in sensitive domestic matters where both legal rights and social norms intersect.",
