  "summary": "This civil appeal before the West African Court of Appeal arose from a land dispute involving the sale of realty and a plea of acquiescence. The third defendant sought to introduce documentary evidence showing that the plaintiff's family had previously acquiesced in the sale of other properties by their Arotas to third parties. The trial court rejected this evidence, mistakenly believing that the Court of Appeal had already decided there was no acquiescence. The appellate court clarified that it had only held the first defendant failed to prove acquiescence, not that the issue was legally foreclosed. Citing the Privy Council decision in Oshodi v. Balogun, the court held that such evidence, while of slight weight, was admissible. The appeal was allowed, the judgment and costs set aside, and the case remitted for a full hearing of all relevant evidence on acquiescence, with the appellant awarded costs in the appeal.",
