  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC v THE HIGH COURT, ACCRA(COMMERCIAL DIVISION)",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana ruled that Justice Tanko Amadu of the Commercial Division of the High Court lacked jurisdiction to hear and determine a contempt application after the 2008 legal vacation had ended, as his authority as a vacation judge had lapsed and there was no formal transfer of the case to his division. The applicant, Dr. Kwabena Appenteng, had been found guilty of contempt by Tanko Amadu J for allegedly violating a court order during the execution of a writ of possession, but challenged the ruling on grounds of lack of jurisdiction. The Supreme Court emphasized that while contempt is a substantive matter, the judge's authority was confined to the vacation period and did not extend beyond it. The Court also reaffirmed that certiorari is a discretionary remedy and will not be granted automatically, even for want of jurisdiction, if the party failed to raise a timely objection. The decision underscores the importance of respecting judicial divisions and procedural rules to prevent forum shopping and maintain judicial integrity.",
