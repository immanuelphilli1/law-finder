  "caseTitle": "LONDON AND NORTHERN TRADING CO (NIGERIA) LTD v ALBERT A.",
  "summary": "The appellant company advanced £200 to the respondent for the purchase of a lorry, which the respondent agreed would remain under lien until repayment. The company later seized the lorry without consent, believing it had a legal right to do so, but this was a mistaken and unlawful detention. Before the plaintiff filed his statement of claim, the police seized the lorry from the company under a magistrate’s order for use as an exhibit in criminal proceedings against the respondent. The trial court ordered the company to return the lorry or pay its value, along with compensation for tools and damages. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that since the company lost possession of the lorry through no voluntary or wrongful act of its own—due to lawful police action—it could not be compelled to return the lorry. The appeal was allowed on this point. However, the company remained liable for the tools and log unlawfully detained and was ordered to return them or pay their value, along with general and special damages.",

    "No claim of ownership was made by the appellant, only a claim of lien.",
    "The respondent did not allege conversion, limiting the scope of liability.",
    "The police would have seized the lorry regardless of who possessed it, negating continued liability for detention.",
    "The appellant remained liable for items (jack, tools, log) still under its control at time of seizure.",
    "The trial court erred in ordering return of goods beyond the defendant's control.",
    "Appellate court corrected the remedy to reflect actual possession and fault."
